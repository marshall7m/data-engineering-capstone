I'm short with a small waist and a bit of a butt :) So that means every pair of jean I get have to be altered.  And Maria does a wonderful job with reasonable prices.  She's done more than10 pairs of jeans and a few shirts and only one needed fixing.  I even lost weight and had to get a pair redone, it was a bit of a challenge but she did a beautiful job.",3

I did! 

I remember eating many many many times way back in the early childhood of Chipotle back in Denver. Like the picture on the wall in every Chipotle. (yep on evans and university) I had a feeling this place was going somewhere and Chaching!

Anyway, long story short, as we all have eaten at a Chipolte somewhere. It simply is the best quick healthyish mexican there is period! 

On a side note if you are one of those wierd vegan people this is my favorite burrito (veggie fajita black w/ all the salsas no queso or crema greens and of course 3 lbs of guac!) Yuuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmaaaaaeeeeeee!!!!!",3
14,3,1549670400000,"I stayed here back in April. Friday-Sunday. It's a nice hotel and the room had a great view. This is just another building that is part of the Palms. It has no casino and is just used for rooms. 

We had the two room suite with 3 bathrooms, and 2 full kitchens. The main bathroom had a huge shower. I swear you can fit around 12+ people if thats what you want to do ;) They also have a tub in the middle of the room so you can watch your girl take a bath? lol The place was beautiful but was it worth the $2000?? I'd say yes, but the only major downside is that it's far from the strip. Would I do it again? Probably not since you can get a nice suite for the same price at a nice hotel and be on the strip. Another downside was that you cannot go out onto the patio. They lock all the sliding doors. That was a big downside for me!",2
22,2,1550361600000,"I was staying at the Hilton next door and got access to the YMCA.  Nice!  One of the days, I woke up with a sore throat.  Headed to the gym anyways, but started coughing horribly just as I checked in.  Had to walk out to clear my throat then went back in and hopped on an elliptical machine.  The lady at the front desk was so nice!  She brought me a cup of water because she noticed that I was coughing so much earlier.  

Amazing service!  Now I wish I belonged to a YMCA back home.  Going to have to look into it for sure.",2
26,1,1550275200000,"I love Bouchon. It's still my favorite place to go hands down. They are extremly fresh and have excellent service. I ate at the bouchon in Beverly hills and didn't encounter a single difference in food quality in Vegas. The food has always been delicious and this one time I went we ordered practically everytihng. From the bakery basket in which the waiter chooses for us a selection of baked goods to the mussels to the hash. 

Everything was delicious. And you can't beat the price around 20-30 a person with small apps. Or aroudn 40-50 if your drinkin a little. Very reasonable for what your getting.

Take a peek at my photos.

Thanks Thomas Keller for a great meal again!",2
32,3,1550448000000,"The whole experience is awesome. They start you off with silly anouncements from the gate. In other words, the staff is friendly, spontaneous, and well, AWESOME. It's a small plane, though, so whether you're travelling a short (ie from San Francisco to Vegas) or longer distance (SF to New York), then Virgin America is the way to go.  

I guess the airline is famous for its mood lighting which is relaxing. They have a really cool in-flight entertainment system - touch-screen, on-demand movies, live satellite TV, radio, etc. So if you're flying, better bring your own headset coz they sell theirs for $2. To sum it up, the experience was so darn good that I wish I had more time on the plane.",2

43,1,1550534400000,"this place is lame! my boyfriend and i decided to check it out because it was their very first 80s night and some dude working for the club gave us a free pass.

so we waited in line about a half an hour, dealt with the rude doorman, got in and um. not much else to be said. 

""80s night"" was going on outside on the patio, and they were playing the worst of the 80s. bad 80s/hip hop mash ups were going on inside with trashy mid-westerners dancing on tables.

we chugged our drinks and were in and out in about 10 minutes.",2
44,3,1549238400000,I really enjoyed my stay at this very reasonable hotel.  The rooms are very spacious and clean.  I really didn't expect to get a warm continental breakfast included at the price I paid for the room.,1
46,1,1550620800000,"Hands down, the BEST kabobs in Vegas. 

I stopped here late after work one night on the way home after having passed it at least a thousand times, and decided to give it a try. I went in, placed my order, and after about 15 minutes, was on my way home. 

The inside is cozy, there is a new hookah lounge upstairs (not technically the same business), for those who might be interested in that. The tables inside were pretty low key, but the kitchen area is open except for some glass, so you get to watch your food prepared while you wait which is always a nice touch. Some people don't like that, but I do, it forces restaurants to practice more hygienic practices because customers can see more. 

The young lady who rang me up was helpful and friendly. The gentleman who gave me my food, apologized for the wait (15 minutes is not long in my book, but maybe for some it is), and said that calling ahead is a great option if you're ever in a hurry in the future. 

I ordered a lamb and chicken shish kabob. They were both DELICIOUS. Many kabobs in this city are incredibly bland and under seasoned, definitely not the case here. The rice was also well flavored. The green sauce that was at the counter where you pick up your food was perfectly spiced and I put it on EVERYTHING! I appreciate the fresh lemon wedge that was included in my to-go container. 

My only real complaint was the price. It was more than $17 for two kabobs, which I thought was on the expensive side. If they took their prices down around $2, I'd be here way more often that is good for my wallet...",2
47,1,1548979200000,"I purchased the Groupon and I honestly shouldn't have. I could've painted my nails better at home and saved $30. It was a rush job. The nail polish isn't even covering the full nail on some nails and other nails, the polish covers the entire nail and a lot of skin too. I had to ask her to clean up the nail polish on both my hands and feet. A customer should never have to ask that question, the nail tech should be able to see that themselves and fix it. Well, she cleaned it up... and there is still polish on my skin surrounding my nails. Needless to say, I won't go back.",2
50,3,1549929600000,"I used to go this office, but as other reviewers have noted, they made a pair of glasses wrong (one lens blurred, could not read with that eye), and then told me, well, your other eye will compensate so you can still read. Really???? What a great way to handle an error in the production of the glasses.  When I objected to being relegated to reading with one eye with my new glasses, the reply was...""Well, then you'll have to see the Dr. again, and no, he is not available now.""  No offer to look up his schedule and see when I could see him again, or see if another Dr. could see me then to resolve it.  After the poor response to the problem (you would think they would have some professional way to deal with when glasses come back from the mfr/lens maker and there is an unexpected issue).  I told them I'm not a patient here any longer and took my useless glasses home and resolved to find a quality optometry office and start over.  I did call back and spoke with an Office Mgr, who stated she would look into the matter and get back to me, but never did.  So I called again and toild them to toss my file out and not contact me again for any future appts. 
 Another thing about their exams.....as part of your exam, they offer to take optional (extra cost) retina photos so you can also have a look at your retinas on a computer screen with the Dr., using a clumsy cube-shaped camera. You sit there and they have you smush your face up against a flat glass panel on the front while they take repeated attempts to get a good photo of your retina. They charge extra if you want this option. Then they raised the price, and I declined due to raising the price. They were charging plenty for that option already.  I moved to a different office that does not charge anything extra at all for the retina photos, and uses a better camera than the camera cube, so no more smushing my face against a flat glass window.

53,3,1550793600000,"I normally don't bother with dealing health stores but I have wanted to try out a hydrogen peroxide therapy to help detox the body and I didn't want to wait 5 days for shipping from amazon and this place popped up.

It was relatively close to where I was and whole foods doesn't carry the 35% h2o2 so I stopped by here. Even though the parking was horrible, the store was pretty open and I was greeted by the owner (or I think it was the owner) and he was very friendly.

I asked for my 35% food grade peroxide and he had some, and it was way cheaper than paying for it on amazon.

5 stars for being clutch, and for having cheap prices.

I feel so bad for this business,",2
63,3,1551225600000,"Parking is tough to get here so I don't get to go much. I also get a little cautious sometimes as they frequently have multiple questionable looking characters.

Pro's:
- Legendary fries that used to be super huge and gave you great value for your buck
- Good burgers
- If you drink, it looks like they have a lot of different kinds of alcohol

Con's:
- Customer Service? Hahaha. Not here. If you can get more than a fart out of one of the twin's working there, you are ahead of the pack.
- Dirty, messy tables, crap everywhere.
- Many questionable characters here. Someone once asked me if I wanted to buy stolen jewelry off them while I was eating. I'm being totally honest too.
- Their french fry portions have gotten smaller. They used to need two baskets for a large fry and now only need one.
- Really expensive hot dogs. 
- They have strict limits on ketchup. No I'm not joking. 2 for large fries, 1 for anything less.

I do recommend getting their legendary fries at least once and I do recommend the egg burger, but get it to go and go when it is light out.",2
64,3,1549497600000,"My dog nips at men so I was terrified of having a man groom.  But she sheds a lot so my fiancé made the appointment and I'm glad he did.  First off, the prices are a steal.  Secondly, the man who groomed her was amazing he was super nice and my dog was calm with him.  My chihuahua/terrier usually has a lot of anxiety around people and she was nervous at first but didn't bite and by the time I came back she was really calm.

68,2,1550880000000,I've been going to Bihlu and Kusums restaurant for over 25 years. The original location was at about 52nd McDowell(it was a treat after squaw peak hike with da)( but they have been at the current location for probably the last 20 years. They have a good mix of North Indian and South Indian food. Masala dosas have always been one of my favorites things to get. The vegies and sambar are always fresh as well. The title may not say it here but they are just as famous for all the amazing sweets they make as well. Indians from all over town order it by the tray but if you arent sure what you want to order ask them to sample it. Jalebi barfi and laddu are some of my go to's. I'm an american born and raised indian so I'm suggesting some of the more tame whitewashed options. The service is quick and the staff is always attentive. You'll see an crowd of ASU kids definitely during cricket matches but they also have indian music videos playing throughout the day. Before I forget my favorite thing to get from there to go is pani puri!. Picture a cracker like hollow bubble with potatoes chickpeas and a spicy sauce. yes my mouth is watering just describing it. I put in mint chutney and tamardind chutney. Im confident you have will a few items that you love and will have again and again.,1

73,2,1550966400000,"It is a cute little place with very friendly staff; however, I went there on three different occasions and was disappointed with the quality of the food. I tried the cheddar and broccoli quiche which was terribly bland (no salt and pepper or nutmeg, no noticeable cheese or broccoli flavor, just bland egg and dough). Another time I had the grilled cheese sandwich - same problem, bland and greasy. If they improved their food, it would be perfect.",2

117,3,1549929600000,"Robuchon was the first 3-star michelin my wife and I had been to (Daniel in NYC only recently attaining their third star).  However, it paled in comparison to many of the 2-starred venues.  The prices are obscene first of all - about double what I've grown accustomed to paying for a  similar experience (even the champagne).  Not to mention, the bites and bubbles menu at Guy Savoy we had tackled two nights prior was MUCH more affordable and more enjoyable.

Our standard 5 course menu began with what was really  an oversized amuse bouche, a chopped apple with spices served in a glass wrapped with pictures of apples.  Good but not worthy of being called an appetizer.  The next dish was cold, shaved foie gras and thin slices of black truffles arranged in a salad.  The truffle slices were old or improperly stored and had absolutely no flavor.  I absolutely love truffles and should have sent it back; huge disappointment.  The foie gras was excellent however.  

The main courses were a boring fish cooked in a unneccesarily huge iron pot and some wagyu steak.  The quality of the steak was amazing, much like the one time I've had authentic prime wagyu before where I was charged far less for the pleasure. 

 The one saving grace of the meal was dessert..  The presentation of a shiny, glittery ball that melted upon contact with a warm sauce was spectacular.  The dessert trolley offered a wide selection of expertly prepared mignardises.  The free take-home box of chocolates was a nice touch.    Service was great but not exceptional and the tables were packed too closely.  

Overall, Robuchon is hardly deserving of 3 michelin stars based on our one experience, though your mileage may vary .  I feel that it was all style over substance and that may be fine for fashion bu not for food.  At half the price, I'd have been more forgiving (3-4 stars), but I felt cheated and given the many other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I don't feel there's any reason to visit Robuchon.  And I say this having gone in with a very positive attitutide after dining at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris, which was exceptional all around.  If you do go to Robuchon, my one piece of advice is to go a la cart, which I didn't realize was an option and seemed almost reasonable.",2
119,3,1550707200000,"Very tasty and more reasonably. Priced than mojo. But....for my food-allergic toddler, no dairy free! ! :( had to load him up w/ fruit and candy. Alas. We got free kid spoons, too.",2

After glancing over the menu, I chose the lasagna, which comes with sourdough bread. I wasn't in a dine-in mood so I took the order togo. The restaurant was clean and I only waited about ten minutes to receive the meal. However, the clean environment and short wait time cannot make up for the bad taste of the food. The lasagna was horrible!! It taste extremely bad and I don't know if it is just me or not but when did lasagna start being made with carrots? Moral of the story is, I will not be returning again!",2

Ordered a specialty margarita that looked nothing like the picture and tasted like a watered down regular margarita. The waitress, who was doing double duty as the hostess, explained that all the bartenders ""do them differently"" and offered to take it back. I kept it, as I'm always afraid to send food back, who knows what I'll get in its place. Luke warm, bland food.

This is the most unprofessional and disorganized range I ever been to. I gave it a chance as it was close my home but I really regret I did

We arrived and immediately put our names on a list, upon asking how long will it be, the lady behind the counter replied, 20 to 30 minutes. That's ok I'll wait a bit and see what happens

I go and observe the range, only 7 spots, seems small but I'll deal with it. I see three lanes open up, range officer says over the radio, three lanes are open. 15 minutes go by, still no one in the lanes. The place is packed at this point.

Other customers are getting irritated. I go back and ask how much longer, she tells me 25 minutes. Another customer starts yelling ""there are three open lanes back there, what's the hold up"" she replies that she didn't know, after I observed four radio transmissions stating three lanes are available and one range personnel coming to the counter to say three lanes are open.

At this point, I had enough, got up and left and proceeded to range 702, where I started shooting within 5 minutes of arrival. 

Do yourself a favor, skip this place, unprofessional and a waste of time with a horrible set up",3

Delivery was right in the timeframe they provided and to my hotel room directly, both my pizza and breadsticks were hot on arrival and the delivery guy was friendly. 

The breadsticks came with a really flavorful sauce and themselves were perfectly baked and seasoned. The pizza was just a cheese pizza and the ratio of cheese/sauce/crust was on point and tasted great! 

As much pizza as I eat I ought to be considered an expert and if I wasn't leaving town tomorrow I'd be visiting these guys again. Great food. Thank you!",2
154,2,1550620800000,"Actually my name is Aaron Sloan. My ex-wife was Erin S. Just clarifying so they know exactly who posted this. I have spent over 1000 dollars and still not finished from 6+k in damages from the estimate on my car that I left there on a Wednesday afternoon and Geico estimated 15 days to repair it and then was told it was done the next Tues.morning. Corners cut? Anyone with half of a brain would agree. I asked where's my new rim damaged in the accident? Oh sorry here is another Geico adjuster present standing next to my car. Owner says my adjuster Tom Fletcher is an asshole and that the guy present standing next to my car was fair and he said he would get me a rim. And the owner also promised the rim regardless and when I asked how much more to do some touch up paint work he said FREE! Long as I would bring my business to them, from now on. 
     He surely noticed that my inspection was up soon as he promised me BOTH! Then I NEVER heard another word from them again since Dec.2016. And still have not been able to afford to fix all of the damage done in the accident that they overlooked due to quick in and out. I had to buy a new battery 3 days later when my car wouldn't start. Whatever mechanic worked on my car forgot to plug in the power cord to my new radiator cooling fan and my car overheated and had to spend money to get a diagnosis why it was overheating and was a simple wire not plugged in. So also proof it was never even tested to see if the new fan worked . This was a front end collision and then I had and still have a loud clicking sound coming from my front wheel where the rim wasn't replaced.  When I took it elsewhere for inspection soon after due to no reply from multiple messages left for the owner gone without a reply? Rather than bother with them after speaking with an ex-employee, I realized I was screwed.  So then I had a broken tie rod not noticed or added to my estimate and anyone knows you need an alignment when you replace a tie rod so another 300 bucks total. 
    But still have the clicking noise or loud tapping and my friend said it's either The CV joint or a bent control arm. But couldn't tell without it on a lift . So now will end up spending a fortune to finally get my car back to perfect operating condition like it was before one of their tow truck drivers just happened to be standing there in downtown Pittsburgh during rush hour with a walkie.  Waiting to prey on me. But I still haven't gotten to the most corrupt part.  Geico paid them from my estimate to recharge my A.C. since it was obvious that it was routine when my radiator, cooling fan, and coolant tank were all destroyed. But guess what happened when I went to actually USE my A.C. a couple months later once winter broke? Hot air. So I took it to Ryan's Auto/Goodyear in Moon. Twp., and explained everything to them. They said well I can't imagine they would have not recharged your system with refrigerant.  So I paid for a diagnosis and dye ran thru the system and nice of them to only charge me 75 bucks and guess what? Cold air!!! NO LEAKS! SO THEY NEVER EVEN RECHARGED MY A.C. Crooks! And guess what else ? I AM AN UBER DRIVER FOR 2PLUS YEARS NOW AND UBER HAS THEIR TEST TRACK BLOCKS AWAY FROM THIS SHOP IN HAZELWOOD JUST BEHIND THE RAILROAD TRACKS! I have driven Uber employees there too many times to count and as well as them? I tell ALL of my riders to NEVER take their car here no matter what.",2

FIrst off the parking is very strange you have to park off to the side and walk past an empty boarded up building to get to the front door.  The decor is more rock diner than mexican restaurant, but nice enough.  On a weekday at 12:00 they were completely empty and it's a huge restaurant so that's a little bit of a concern right off the bat.  I had the cheese enchiladas which were ok, not anything special and kinda plain.  The Corn pudding for a side was something you never see and was the best thing on my plate.  The Anaheim Chili stuffed with sweet potato would be better if they removed the skin. It was pretty inedible the way it was served and very messy to scrape the pepper and potato off the skin to eat it.  I will give them props for trying something different, but poor execution at any rate.

My two most favorite meals from Caramba's are the bean and cheese burrito (fresh tortillas and the perfect mix of cheese to beans) and the chicken quesadilla. Oh, how I miss my chicken quesadillas since I went vegetarian. Delicious grilled chicken, cheese, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, sour cream, and then add some of their amazing mild salsa, and you'll seriously be in heaven.  My dad is a huge fan of their machaca burrito, and he's pretty picky when it comes to machaca. So I'd have to trust him and believe that it's pretty darn good.

The beverage cabinet at the front by the register was completely empty
The only good thing about this meal is I ordered a peanut butter smoothie and that one was fine. 
My friend ordered the same sandwich that I did instead she was delivered and Apple turkey sandwich that was very dry. No chips we had to go after the chips and they had no water and no napkins with our meal or on the table.

Gambling doesn't interest me, and I didn't come here to dine, but as far as a place to stay, it was an incredible deal.  Room was clean, nice, great view. loved the built in table along the length of the window (I even saw my laptops smile).

Great bargain, no resort fees, good base to take off from...",2

The selections of pre made dips and different meats is the number one thing I  love about it. Its is one of the only stores that I have seen carry Hawaiian shorts ribs already marinaded!! (Mmmm). They don't have tons of produce but they do have a good selection. They have awesome bouquets of fresh flowers that are super cheap! Natural shampoos, toothpaste, ect. Dog food, wine, gluten free selections, and on on!!

In think it was such a great idea to hide a fake  parrot....or at this store it's a sea horse, to keep kids occupied while shopping. If they find the hidden Sea horse they get a treat. Yay!!!  They have these adorable little kids carts too which my kids loved!",2

242,1,1549497600000,"A wonderful little shop with very much a community feel to it.  Kit runs a nice and unique spot which is rarely seen these days - her vision is clear and focused in the decor, product assortment and services provided by the boutique.  ""Boutique"" truly is the appropriate word to use here, as the focus here isn't all about just turning product - she takes her time to educate and curate a broad array of interesting and cutesy little products that are not easily found elsewhere.  Outside of succulents, there is a finely collected assortment of little planters, pots and decorative items for creating your own miniature diorama.  My wife and I went to Plant It to participate in their succulent planting workshop.  The experience was wonderful.  Kit was hospitable, educational and created a very welcoming and fun environment for the experience.  We both enjoyed it very much - Kit helped document the process via taking photos, and guided us both in the selection, care and the assembly process.  Highly recommended--we will be back.

Note: Plant It does not only have succulents, but also these cool ""sleeping flowers"" which are living, last 10 years, are low maintenance and come in some fantastic neon colors.  A great place for gift ideas, favors and sprucing up your place.",3

His fish ceviche was boiled instead of cooked in lime and his tostada was warm not cold. He ordered shrimp and octupus cocktail they gave him shrimp and oysters, it also smelled bad. My mexican plate was also not good. The beans had no flavor, the enchilada & chile relleno were not good. I was only able to eat half. My sons fries were over priced.  The floor was dirty, at the entrance, that should of been our first clue. We went because we heard promo on spanish radio. Thought it would be good.

This location has just really gone down hill, I've been to many Benihanas throughout the country from locations in Atlanta, Detroit, San Diego, and this location is the absolute worst experience I've ever had at a Benihana's.

Not just send the product on it's way - my hubby picked it up - so not sure if he even looked at it before taking it.  I would have taken one look & refused it.  Got all the way home & it just looked gross - feel really bad cause my little daughter was the one that wanted it .  We picked out the good ones & tossed the rest.  Now - saying this to the manager - he didn't even offer a refund or an apology - second manager did - & offered an apology which the first manager didn't even offer.  Really disappointing.

307,1,1549756800000,"A friend had been trying to get me to try acupuncture for years (every time I mentioned that my back hurt), but I would say, ""Needles? No thanks!"" I was recently in Las Vegas the week of Independence Day for a poker tournament and my back was hurting so much that I was having difficulty sitting at the tables for long periods of time. I got massages for three days in a row but got only a small amount of temporary relief. I thought about going to a chiropractor, but remembered how many times my friend had tried to get me to see her acupuncturist and decided I should give it at least one try. Boy, am I glad I did! 

The needles are very, very fine and I only felt a small prick with a few (not even close to either a vaccination or finger stick)-- this was NOT a painful procedure. He inserted 16 of them from my neck to my ankles and then asked me to guess how many were there. I guessed 6-8. I seriously didn't even feel the others and none of them hurt. They then hooked some kind of electrodes to 6 of them (I was lying face down and couldn't see what he was doing) and sent weak electrical pulses through them. If you've ever had TINS treatments, the amount of current was far less (no muscle twitches) and felt as if someone was gently tapping my back in each spot. Then, they turned off the lights and played New Age type music while I relaxed. I don't know how long that lasted (maybe 15-20 minutes?) because I didn't have my watch on, but it was like taking a nap. After this time, they disconnected the electrodes and removed the needles. I felt very calm and a little groggy at this point. I had told him that I would be playing poker later that evening and he recommended that I take a nap when I returned to my hotel. I took his advice and when I awoke, I felt great! In fact, I was even able to walk from Caesar's to Bally's later to catch the free shuttle without any pain. Sure, that's not a great distance, but there is no way I could have done that prior to my acupuncture treatment. I got a second treatment the next day (my last full day in town) and when I left Las Vegas, I was pain free. Just today (about 10 days later) my lower back pain has been bothering me again (though not as severe), so tomorrow morning I will look up the local doctor whom my friend recommended. I hope he is as good as Dr. Lok! If you are in Las Vegas and have back pain, you really need to go to Dr. Lok.",2

Yes, it is a Cigar Lounge, housing a large humidor with excellent stogies, but it is more, and worth exploring, even if you don't smoke cigars. 

Of course they have a wide selection of single malts, cognac and typical spirits which accompany puffing away; they also have a full bar. The decor is dark and rich, and seating is comfortable; very men's clubby feeling to me, in a good way. 

Staff has always been knowledgeable and welcoming, friends who dig cigars like the variety, and the live music we have caught at times added an extra cool vibe. A nice place to have a nightcap in Tivoli.

336,2,1550534400000,"This last year, I finally saved up for the down payment on a car. I needed one very badly, having been using a relative's vehicle for several months, but that they now needed back. I had planned ahead and done my research, and wanted a Ford CMax Hybrid. My work offered a discount/cash-back deal through Cars.com, so I submitted the request and my info was sent to Berge. My plan was to take advantage of the 4th of July weekend specials.

I was almost immediately sent an email from a salesman named Chris. He wanted to know what I was looking for in a vehicle. I replied right away with the details... But the only email address given was a generic one, nothing direct. There was no response. A few days later, he sent me another email, this time with a map to the dealership, but with no indication my reply was received. I replied back, asking for some quotes, but again got no response. I was anxious with the impending July 4th weekend, but held hope I could still make contact. I decided to call. 

Unfortunately, the only number he gave me was his personal cell. That Friday after work, I called and was immediately sent to voicemail. I got a text saying he was at dinner, but would return my call. I left a voicemail explaining that I badly needed a car, either from him or someone else at the dealership, and that he hasn't actually replied to my emails (maybe he forgot to check the general inbox?) and I asked him to call me  back ASAP. I really needed the July 4th specials. 

The weekend came and went, no reply from Chris. Frustrated, I went to a different dealership in Scottsdale and worked with wonderful people, and that next weekend negotiated a deal on a beautiful CMax that made up for missing out on both the holiday weekend deals and the cash-back deal through my work. TWO WEEKS LATER Chris emails me to say their servers were out of commission, which is why he didn't get my emails, and he would love to help me into a car (this all being said in poor spelling and no caps or punctuation ).

My brother was a car salesman for awhile, so I have a pretty good idea how it goes. I was only given his personal cell number so he could make sure he got my sale instead of anyone else. I'm also an IT student, so I have a very hard time believing their servers were down for two whole weeks. Either they have the worst tech support in the history of ever, or I was put off so I wouldn't have to be offered a holiday deal. Plus, what, did you not check your voicemail?? 

My experience here was beyond unprofessional. I'm glad, now, that I went where I did for my car. Berge only saw my business as a number. I will never shop with them.",2

376,1,1550016000000,"I am a huge Bobby Flay fan and was so happy to finally try his food firsthand.  At first, I was really turned off by the ""tex-mex"" concept and even the name ""Mesa Grill"" didn't sound too appetizing, but we took a risk... and Bobby delivered.  We came here for my husband's 27th birthday and he had a wonderful time.

SERVICE: 
5 Solid Stars!  The hostesses sat our party right away even though not everyone was there.  We were immediately served water and asked if we wanted any cocktails.  I really loved our waiter.  He wasn't just polite and attentive, but he was also engaging us in wonderful conversation throughout our meal.  He talked to us about how long he had been working there, and what Bobby's like... and he knew the menu like the back of his hand.  It was like having a new friend dine with us throughout the duration of our meal.  I wish I caught his name so I can give him props!

FOOD:
Bread Basket - 2 stars.  They start you off with a variety of breads.  There was a jalapeno one, another one with some blue corn in it, and a third one that I can't recall.  All were very unique, but unfortunately, I wasn't a fan.  I didn't think the bread was very soft or moist, and the flavors didn't do it for me.  Kudos for thinking outside the box though.  The butter also wasn't the soft, spreadable kind.

Blue Corn Pancake - 5 stars.  This appetizer came highly recommended by our server.  There was barbecued duck inside pancake (like a glorified taco), and a habanero chili star-anise sauce drizzled all over it.  The flavors all worked so well together to deliver an explosion of flavors in my mouth.

Spanish Chorizo Quesadilla - 4 stars.  This was larger than expected!  It is pretty filling and could easily be substituted for a meal as a filler.  Or you can split this between 2-3 people and share it as an appetizer.  It's a pretty heavy dish and hard to eat too much of.  There's a large fried egg on top of a tortilla.  Embedded in the tortilla is smoked tomato salsa, grilled green onion, and crispy artichokes.  

For our entree, my husband and I shared the New Mexican Spice-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin even though I was realllly eyeing the 22 ounce bone-in Ribeye.  The waiter said the pork tenderloin was their signature dish so that's why we ordered it even though I'm not a huge fan of pork.  It wasn't until the dish arrived that we were convinced we had made the right choice!!  WOW, that was one tender, delicious, savory, melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat.  The spice rub added a bit of heat, and I can easily say this is the best piece of pork I've ever been served.  It came with a side of the most amazing tamale.  I can't even begin to describe how good it was.  You just have to try it.  5 Stars for this entire dish!!!

I sampled some of the other dishes from my friends, but the pork dish was the definite standout.  My friend ordered the lamb chops, but they tasted a bit gamey and weren't as tender as they could've been.  The pan seared Halibut was tender and flaky paired with a lovely curry spice reduction.  I'd give both these dishes 4 stars.  

All in all a wonderful experience.  Glad I finally got to try one of Bobby's restaurants!",2

381,1,1550793600000,"I love being proven wrong about celebrity chef-endorsed restaurants;  Carnevino in the Venetian put me off making fun of Mario Batali forever.  His emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   But this restaurant has done nothing for Mr. Flay's Southwestern recipes.  

A friend and I had lunch at MESA today, and before I get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  Helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help. 

  We assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the Cobb salad.  And over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   My pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern fries was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  Now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. 

  Without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    Adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (Which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.

20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.

I think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of the latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.  

Sorry Bobby, maybe you should return and retune.",2

397,2,1551312000000,"Tip: Don't forget to get a punch card for a free wash!

My dogs nails seem to grow an inch a day and he will fight to not have them trimmed. I have taken him multiple places but haven't had the success I have here. They let me in the room while they trim his nails so I can hold and comfort him, plus they do all their grooming behind a window so you always know what is going on. I drive twenty minutes out of my way to come here because we consistently have a fantastic experience. 

I prefer to wash my dog myself (so I don't have any experience with the additional grooming services they offer). The facility is always clean, easy to use and the employees are super helpful (and seem to really enjoy their jobs). They have everything you could need to groom, including toothbrushes, brushes, and towels/dryers. I always go with the basic wash and have been very happy with it (about $15). Their pricing is the same no matter the size/breed. My dog is about 45 pounds so for me it's worth it but might not be if you have a tiny dog. 

The food/treats are great too. Super healthy brands that I can feel good about feeding my dog. They sell toys/leashes/collars as well. We always end our trip with one of their bakery items, which my dog gobbles up.

When i said ""uhm I am bleeding"" she wiped the blood off (not gently) and tried to act as if it did not happen. I was still charged full price even after being injured! I walked out literally crying because my fingers were burning in so much pain. Later my fiance and I went back to speak with the manager/owner about the situation and he LAUGHED TO OUR FACE!!! He did not apologize, all he said is that he would fix it, but last time I checked you cannot just magically heal someones cut fingers. When I asked to see the license of the technician he said ""I do not have to show you that"". I find it highly likely that he refused to show us the license because she probably does not have one. There is so much more I could say about how awful they were but I think people should get the idea. I WOULD NOT EVER SUGGEST ANYONE GO HERE!",2

Lots of creative and traditional rolls on the menu. I pretty good selection of nigiri, and a nice variety of sake. My favorite was Sparkling Blueberry Sake, very refreshing and you can taste the berry flavor.

They offer an all-you-can eat option from 5-7 pm for $28.95. This is a very cost effective way to go when you are hungry and the all-you-can eat menu has almost everything on it. Beware, they will always serve rolls first to fill you up, so if you order nigiri make sure to specifically ask to have it brought out first.

Took it to BMW and they quoted me $2700 for the cooling system. Munich did a full repair on that, plus a valve cover gasket plus fixed another leak and found that my check engine light was bc a bad air/fuel mixture and the total repair was less than one at BMW. Then had my shift mechanism go out after I picked it up from those repairs and was like ""this is weird"". Talked to Grant and he said there wasn't a direct connection to their work as they were in a different part of the car but was willing to fix it at cost using a used part with a warrantee and it runs great.

However, the past 3-4 times I've been there, the service has gone WAY downhill.  From the greeting to the service at the tables...wow.

2nd to last time I went I was told ""1 hour"" for 3 people.  Stood around outside for a bit...got cold and went inside to buy a to-go coffee (which I've always been able to do before).  Was told by one of the servers that it was ""discouraged"" to get coffee before we sat down, so we can go get coffee down the street...in a condescending ""why are you bothering me"" tone.

Um...you discourage people to buy coffee from you?

Last time I went, another 1 hr wait for 2 people.  Came back 30mins later, and wanted to see how far we were on the list.  The server snatched up the list, and said ""An hour from whenever I first told you"" and walked away.

Nice.

I suggest (as do they) ordering little-by-little and opting for half rolls, when you can. This is to prevent people from ordering extra rolls ""to-go.""

She had a Mesa burger, which might be the best burger she ever had.  Cooked exactly as ordered (rare),it was thick, juicy and loaded with flavor.  Even the bun stood out.

My cornmeal crusted chile relleno had a delicious crust loaded with great corn flavor.  The pepper itself could have spicier to my taste, but the cheese and sauce inside blended perfectly-a well presented lunchtime treat.

605,1,1550707200000,"If you wanted to make an embodiment of all the stereotypes that are wrong with the fitness industry, that embodiment would be LA Fitness.

We have had a number of issues with LA Fitness. To keep this short we were lied to about personal training contracts which set off a cascade of events.  We had personal training for a year with LA.  When that expired we went to cancel our training and were told, at the time of signing, that we could use any banked sessions after canceling.  The personal training manager at the gym on Riverview (Peter) told us this was not the case and to prevent our 16 banked sessions from expiring 30 days later we could change our contract to one session per month.  We did.  After that we could never get in with our trainer.  We would show up to discover that he was working with someone else, we would schedule times with him and then they would mysteriously fall off the schedule, and we even noticed that we were being charged for sessions with other trainers that we didn't book.  We believe that Peter was filling our trainer's schedule with new clients and pushing us off since we were on our way out. When talking to Peter he was sure to inform us of his salary and that to keep his position he needs to keep his body fat under a certain percentage.

I spoke with James T. (VP of Personal Training) and we worked out a deal.  We were refunded some of the sessions we had banked and could keep the balance without them expiring.  We had to take a few months off of lifting due to an injury so this was a great arrangement.

When we went to use the sessions we were told they had expired.  I contacted James to get them back.  After four weeks and five voice messages James never called me back.  I emailed the customer service email and they eventually called me.  They only gave me 3 sessions back.  I told them this was unacceptable as we should have had 4 and that I would not allow them to just steal the session.  I then received a call from the Regional Operations Manager for Phoenix.  He agreed to refund us for the one session that was still in dispute.

We went to the gym on Stapley/University to use our three sessions.  We were very specific about what we wanted.  All we needed at this time was help to perfect squat and deadlift form.  We were told that Joseph is the guy for that.  We scheduled a time to work with Joseph.  We showed up as scheduled and the front desk informed us that he doesn't work at that time.  We checked the schedule in the app to find out that somebody moved our appointment with Joseph from a saturday to a thursday without contacting us.  We then rescheduled a time with Joseph.

When we met Joseph for our session he very arrogently and aggressively scolded me for asking him to only help us with form. ""That's not how training works, if you're going to work out with me I'm going to make your plan and you're going to do what I say.""  We spoke with the manager and he told me we could either work out with Joseph or not, but that we would be charged for the session.  We were very specific when we scheduled the session that we did not want him to make a plan and that all we needed was help with our form.  

I chose not to challenge this because I was tired of having to speak with people in upper management to resolve issues caused in the gym and this was the third strike for LA Fitness.  We were charged the session and we will simply allow the last two sessions to go unused rather than giving LA another opportunity to disappoint us.  We have canceled our membership and will work out at a different gym moving forward.

Throughout our time at LA Fitness we have been treated as a bank for which to remove money.  The service has been terrible, we have been continually lied to, being scolded and talked down to by a person whom I paid $100 per hour to work out with was the last straw.  I will not miss LA Fitness.  

My best recommendation is to avoid LA Fitness.",2

Some of the staff is really nice, others are not. Some are just terrible. There was this one lady putting a basket of sunglasses on the rack. A customer next to me, reached across me to grab into the basket. The employee told her she couldn't do that and that she would have to wait for her to set them on the rack. Which I understand, because the glasses would be all over the floor if the customer went diving into them. The funny part ....as the employee was filling the rack, she took her time and spun the freshly placed sunglasses towards the wall, away from that lady. The customer looked SO mad.

This is the closest theater to my house so it's usually the go to spot.

The floors don't seem to be overly sticky and the bathrooms are clean. The sound and screens seem to be good in the theater sections I have been in. It has the little kiosks out front so you can speed through and get your tickets most times.  
My only complaint is the concession lines. No i am not going to complain about the price, it's a movie theater after all. The last two times they have up-sold the person in front of me on some member card thing that I had to stand around and wait while they fill out a full questionnaire.

The Mediterranean Bronzino was perfectly prepared and totally delicious.

I tried some of their famous butter cake, it was as a good of a desert that I have ever tried, just too full to eat much of it.

If you are in Scottsdale, don't miss this place.",2

THE UP-SIDE:
The food is decent and will definitely fill you up.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
This place is downright unsanitary at times.  I've witnessed the person behind the counter rub their coworker's neck (greasy curls falling all over their gloves) and then turn to make my burrito; touching my food with the same gloves.  At other times, I've watched them drag the burrito across the counter top, pulling whatever germs were there along with ""my food.""  On yet another occasion, I witnessed them pulling up a container from behind a burrito belonging to a customer in front of me.  The container dropped a bunch of dirty water onto it.  Needless to say, I watch really carefully now when they make my food.  Also, this location has a few girls working here that are damn annoying; always yelling and laughing to the point of irritation.

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Good food but HIGHLY unsanitary at times.  Roll the dice...

UPDATE MONTH'S LATER:  I decided to lower my guard and go here today.  What a mistake.  I ordered the 4 crunchy tacos.  And, where every other decent Chipotle will fill each taco separately - as they indeed should - this one took it to the opposite extreme.  The girl behind the counter was lazy and indifferent. She plopped each of the salsa's on top of the shells, not in them.  By the time she was about to put the lettuce on that I had asked for, I had to stop her.  I said, ""Stop.  Please.  You've completely covered the shells.  I can't even see them any longer.  You've done nothing but make a giant mess that I have to fix up if I'm going to eat a taco that has something in it.""

She got all huffy like, ""Well, I never!""  Too bad.  If nobody tells her that her absolute laziness is making a mess of my meal, she will never change.  (And by the way - it was not busy at the time. In fact, it was nearly dead in there.  She had no good excuse.)

I'll never eat at this sh#thole Chipotle again.  The others aren't so bad, but this location truly - truly - just doesn't give a damn.",2

Their portions are big and come with sour cream, cheese and salsa. Guac is extra which is a bummer. The only bad thing about the visit? Their queso was soupy which was kind of gross-thicker queso would've made it perfect.

Two days ago, my wife and I were looking for a local bakery in the Avon/Avon Lake area for desserts for a family party. All other bakeries were closed/closing. I called Ventito and Donna, the owner answered. This was at 3:45 and they were scheduled to close at 4. I asked if they had any cupcakes we could come grab and she said SURE! She asked me to give her 20 minutes because they were just made the night before and they hadn't been frosted yet. My wife and I showed up at 4:10, ten minutes after they closed (!!!) and Donna let us in while she was still frosting our cupcakes! She took the time to make sure our desserts were perfect, even though it kept her working past business hours! Not only that, but then she had is try several other desserts, all of which were delicious, so she could get our opinions on them. Ventito is an absolutely great place, family owned, and I will make sure to go back for years.

15 Word Summary: Best takeout Asian BBQ Pork, in terms of price, flavour, and quick takeout turnover     blah. (there it's 15 words)

BBQ'ed food is already legendary as is but Asian style BBQ is some sort of mythical magical food expedition that you only get to experience if you're lucky and end up in a great restaurant.

Luckily Kum Hong BBQ is one of those great restaurants. For $5.25 (CASH ONLY) you get a bed of rice with a good serving of juicy, delicious, amazing BBQ pork. In terms of price, flavour and texture, this BBQ CANNOT be beat (yes I challenge you to find a competitor!). 

However I have to say that this place really isn't much of a ""restaurant"". Tea is self-serve, there's no real dining space except for two small counters where you will be crowded by the lineup of people looking to fill their appetites with BBQ Pork, chicken, duck, etc. But I don't really care as long as they can keep the cost as low as this!",3

The hummus, though tasty, was VERY thick!  Almost like cutting into a soft cheese - not spreadable.  We asked for some oil to add to it and felt that that was really a just so-so solution.  I doubt seriously that it was freshly made - thinking it had been sitting around for a while.  
Our pastitsio was ok - not very hot when served though, my guess is that it was microwaved.  Our pasta (ziti)  was the worst we've had in a restaurant ever - in that it was SO overdone.  Normally, if a dish isn't perfect , we will not ask for a replacement, but this was luke warm and SO mushy and starchy and tasteless. The server explained something that I really didn't want to know - that the pasta is precooked at the beginning of the day and then reheated ! - not cooked to order.  Our server was accomodating, but the whole experience was much less than wonderful.  While we expect ethnic music in an ethnic restaurant, theirs was so loud that after a couple times around the play list we were really quite ready to leave and had our 2nd plate of ziti (only slightly less mushy) packaged to go.  a big disappointment - glad we had a groupon.  BUT - it turns out that our server's insistance that the groupon required us to order two entrees (rather than the mix of soup/salad and one entree we'd planned to order) was NOT true. We didn't have the groupon with us - only on my phone and I didn't look closely at it until I got home and looked at it more closely on my lap  top. SO that less than hot, overdone ziti was the dish that we actually didn't plan to order - but we had to, and that pushed our lunch order over the $30 limit of the groupon -- just an overall bad lunch experience - after a previous lunch there which was much better.",2

The food.  She had the Cajun Garlic Butter Salmon.  The rice was tender, the sauce was spicy - but not overbearing.  The fish was cooked masterfully.  Moist and flaky, not falling apart all over the place.

The crawfish.  I got a bag with corn and sausage; spicy Louisiana style.  The heat was PERFECT.  It was hot, but I never had to stop and sit because my mouth was on fire.  Many places struggle to find the delicate balance between flavor and heat, but that struggle was nowhere to be found here.  The sausage was tender, boiled in the same juices.

I know you can get a classier atmosphere in a chic-ier spa, but you're going to PAY for that one hour and when you leave, you're nails and toes aren't going to look any better than if you'd gone to TDN!  I just took my daughter there on Tuesday for a full set and a pedi and it cost me $36.00 (not including the tip)!  I was paying $80.00 for the same thing down in Tucson.

931,1,1551052800000,"5 stars. Just like that. BAM! Listen to me, I have an obsession with sushi. I have tried sushi in Europe, sushi in Oakville, in Toronto, Vaughan, Richmond Hill - you name it. 
Actually, my goal in life is to find the perfect AYCE place. This might be it...

First of all - the sashimi pieces are the size of a small child. I can honestly say I ate a whole salmon and a whole tuna to ma face. They also have talapia sashimi and talapia tempura - YUMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THE GALBI DOESN'T STOP FLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the staff is so nice - I ask for 40 pieces?? Sure! Anything I want - I AM THE KING OF THE SUSHI WORLD!!!!!!!!!

They have mussels - garlic butter and wasabi mussels, which is hard to find in a lot of AYCE places.

They have coconut shrimp - MASSIVE coconut shrimp. It's deep fried to golden perfection and not overly battered. 

Their maki have ONE layer of rice. Max 2. So little rice that I can see the seaweed through it. The pieces are exploding with fish. AMAZING!!!

Spider rolls and Kaze roll are my favorite. I think the Kaze roll is the one with 3 fish in it (salmon, white tuna and red tuna? maybe talapia) - ask them when you get there, some of the rolls have weird names but they are deliciousoooo.


I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO EVERYONE! ANYONE AND EVERYONE! PLEASE GO - don't listen to overly critical reviews. People have unreasonably high expectations for AYCE sushi. Kaze is quality and quantity and FREE POP. And it's relatively cheap - 20.99 for weekday dinner and 22.99 for weekend.",2
947,2,1550275200000,"During weekday 12-4PM, It is only $23.  You don't get desert.  We went there on a Thursday.  It wasn't too crowded, we get very good service.
Good selection of seafood items and vegetables.  I like the lamb,  it tasted good but a bit tough.  The soap base is just OK, but not as good as the ones at the Noodle place in Gold Coast Casino.  They charge $17 for the lamb Shabu already.  It makes this place a good deal for $23 weekdays.

We went to the Rio Seafood buffet on Sunday and it was $45.  So again , it is a pretty good deal if you like seafood and go for lunch on weekdays.

I highly recommend this place for shabu on weekday lunch only for $23.",2

I have been coming here since they opened about six years ago. I am always serviced by Robert, who is the only good thing at this place and he will soon see he is simply too good for the people he works for.

One day, I decided to try the blow dry bar. I had a great experience with a nice girl. I then called to schedule another appointment with her and did not remember her name, so I referred to her as the white girl and then there were two other African American girls who work there.

The girl that I usually saw was not there this day, so I asked if they had any other people working who weren't the African American girls because I thought they only did hair cuts and African American girls hair. Either way, it is none of their business why or who I wanted to do my hair. I am the one PAYING!

I tried scheduling an appointment for my massage about a week later and the owner Scott gets on the phone and calls me racist and tells me that he does not want me to return to the spa. WOW! He then said he would call me back that day to talk further. He never returned my call. I had to physically go there and have the receptionist call him to give me a call. Talk about unprofessional. 

I never wanted to cause any problems here, but Eva, the owners wife, has not once acknowledged my existence when I'm spending thousands and thousands of dollars at her spa! And to think I wanted to be serviced by someone who doesn't even say hello to me or introduce themselves. Now I'm here to tell the truth about the sick minds behind this business.

They rail people in with their promotions and then when you go to pay, they only will accept one gift card per transaction. Do not waste your money at this place. They are frauds and make false accusations.

Also, the owner said he just fired an employee for making racial comments. What do you expect from a spa in the middle of FOX CHAPEL?! Every women who walks in that door has been fed with a silver spoon and more.",2
986,3,1550966400000,"Round 2 - Restaurant Week again!

This time around I was quite disappointed.  My group ordered pretty much everything on the Restaurant Week menu.  I went with the Seared Ahi Tuna, Short Ribs, and Peanut Butter Bar.  Overall, everything was well cooked, however over....over salty!  The texture was just fine, but in the end too much salt.  I usually drink a lot of water when I eat, but tonight they should have left the pitcher.  My group in general drank a lot of water!  I would talk more about the food, in the end all I can remember was --- dang that was salty!  Sorry gang I don't know if I can go another round for this place. Ding, ding, ding -- Enjoy!",3

The stars off are for the high prices on the delicious food, the extra fee for the fresh ingredients, and the lady that makes an effort to call you  'honey', but makes no effort to disclose the extra charges ***BE AWARE WHEN YOU ORDER**** they charge extra for the sour cream, the dressing, the guacamole, and every other tiny thing it seems. I ordered a burrito that was only $7.99 on the menu, but somehow became a $13 item by the time of check out :/ I was almost in shock when I got the price. It feels almost like a bait and switch. No restaurant manager should ever be proud that people think they have a bait and switch. This happens only when they don't care. But mostly likely they don't even read the reviews either because no restaurant owner should ever be content with a 3 stars restaurant. If that was the case, they would know how important the reviews are. If they don't care, I personally don't either.

Cocktails are sensational, the menu always reminds me of Sophie's Choice, I will have to leave at least one loved one behind. The Rajah's Dry Ribs usually win the day (as well as a place on most best of Toronto lists) order a bit of sauce on the side. The tile is ample and delicious and treat yourself to a side of onion rings, they are darn near perfect. When the mussels are available, they are spectacular. Portions are over the top substantial but try to save room for dessert. Never a disappointment. Fresh quality ingredients all, combined with uncommon skill and attention to detail. And a delightful low key atmosphere, a bit out of the way and better for it I think. I've never felt rushed. Fine service. My number one go to in Toronto,or did I mention that already?",2
1004,2,1549411200000,"I've gotta say, I enjoy my Thai Tai subs. My favourite sub is the Teriyaki Chicken with some cucumber, carrots and cilantro. The bun has a nice crunch to the crust. It's just the right thickness to go with the sub filling as well.

I quite enjoy the lychee smoothie as well. It's the same thing as the bubble tea, just without the bubbles. You heard it here, you can definitely ask for your bubble tea without the bubbles. Little jelly things in my drink just freaks me out a little.

Note: I'm not sure about the other locations, but the 17th Ave spot is more of a walk-in/take-out kind of a place. There's one bench to sit down and wait on, but no tables. It works if you got the sub, but if you ordered any of the other meals, expect to be finding somewhere else to eat it.",2

1043,2,1549843200000,"Where Humble may have fallen short for other Yelpers in the past, it surpassed expectations for my family and I this past Saturday. 

Let me start by saying we came in during the dinner rush on a Saturday and were able to immediately sit at the bar area. While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. 

As far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.

My dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. 

We ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. 

Something tells me I'm going to have a hard time convincing my family to try any other restaurants next time we have plans to eat out in Lakewood.",2
1048,2,1549065600000,"I've never been more convinced that Trinity Bellwoods Park is the remnants of the crater caused by an alien crash site than after last year's Nuit Blanche.  Wandering through this park after dark is eerie enough, but wading through it at 3am in the fog?  With all kinds of people dazedly roaming around staring at creepy art installations?  Priceless.

This park offers some rare downtown hill climbing, which is great if you want to add a little switch to your workout routine (or if you just like rolling down hills).  In the midst of fall foliage season or the first blooms of spring, heading down to Trinity Bellwoods for a little nature loving is practically a requisite pilgrimage.  And while it's a little less impressive than the more Westerly High Park, you are certainly going to feel a little sigh of green relief after an afternoon's frolick (preferably after brunch to work off the Hollandaise-related fog).  

This city can be so gray at times, especially if your neighborhood has more concrete than grass.  Stepping into the park for a few hours' stroll is a huge way to decompress.  The best thing is to go watch all the dogs running around, so happy to be out of their tiny confines and running about, meeting new friends and chasing them around.

Since the place is indoor/outdoors, there is no air conditioning, but the server was happy to point a fan in our direction when we asked, and kept our water glasses full the whole time.  She was attentive without being annoying, and as I former server I am hyper aware of the quality of service at an establishment.  

Food was timed perfectly and the portions were great - I kept some for lunch the next day.  The sangria was lovely - clearly made with good wine - and the calamari appetizer was fresh and tender.  My companion had a tikka masala pizza and I had the Madras chicken.  It was great - it had just enough heat to be flavourful without being overly spicey.

Quickly we figure out that I've made my appointment with Pearson and not them.   Prepared to just forgo my appointment with Pearson and make a new appointment with Visionworks, I inform them the reason for my visit (Glaucoma check) and ask them if they have my old records to compare my next visit with.   Thier answer:  ""We have you on file but your records are in storage"".   I'm not sure what that means.  Are they still using manilla folders and file cabinets?  Do they have a unit at Uncle Bob's Storage?  Quickly I realize I want to keep my appointment with Pearson.  So I appolgize for the interuption and ask them where Pearson EyeCare is.  The ""wrong"" Optometrist ended up being the ""right"" one.    I don't have insurance and the price for a full exam was extremely reasonable.  My family is predisposed to Glaucoma and Diabetes and I fear blindness more than death itself.   Dr. Hagstrom picked up on this, and explained every test (and the results)  AND...Even though I had my retinal scan done (which was probably more than adequate) she also dialated my pupils and inspected each eye herself.    Long story ... L O N G E R ...  I get home thinking my eye pressure was in the 90 range as that was the readings I got off one of the tests.  Through google I learned that 20 was a normal pressure.  A tad bit panicked I called late Friday and left a message asking for clarification.   Dr. Hagstrom called me herself the following morning (a Saturday) and put me at ease and explained that the readings of ""90"" that I remebered were another unit of measurement for a different kind of test.   She gave me my eye pressure readings and they were in fact 20 in each eye (which is normal yay!)

It was handed to me on a basket, and the top of one half had already fallen off and pieces of bacon were scattered as well.

My wife received a borage of ""I'm sorry!""s which is awesome and conveys how the workers were feeling at the time. The most important question or worry during this situation is #1 How does the customer feel? #2 How can we help them? #3 What can we do to rectify the situation? In retrospect all we received was late food, apologies, wet pants, napkins, and a bill to pay for it all. Yes a bill! The manager came over attempting to offer apologies and a mop. Not once did she offer a solution to rectify my wifes ruined clothes and meal. I as her husband had to speak up and ask for some type of resolution. Some people have the knack to be a store manager while others just don't. This type of manager is what I commonly refer to as a floater. Floaters are managers who do just enough to maintain current numbers and current status quo. They really have no talent or abilities which are beneficial to improving the overall profitability or running of the store. When this location implements points #1,#2, &#3 they will be taking a step in the right direction. It is needless to say that we won't be back anytime soon nor recommending it.",2

1150,1,1551052800000,"Tonight I tried for the first time Sombrero's and it was amazing! I got the meat quesadilla with asada it was soo yummy! I tried it with some of the guacamole, sour creme and jalapeño creme cheese, needless to say it was worth the heart burn! 

My mom got the 3 soft tacos with the carnitas. She says it's delicious with the jalapeño creme cheese and spicy sauce. What she's ranting and raving about is the horchata. She says that it tastes like vanilla ice cream but melted haha. I tried a taste and I thought it tasted like a shake. She wishes that she had more because she finished it before we even got home and we only live down the street. I also want to add that the family that runs it so nice and friendly. 

We will definitely be back. Next time is burritos!",2

Last night we were in Gilbert and tried their Green Chili burger.  Wow...my favorite taste of the night!  The burger itself has such a savory succulent juiciness...and the green chili added a nice amount of heat.  Also have had their breakfast burrito which was yummy.  I like the service they provide also...letting you know about the ingredients they use, their farm you can visit, and bringing out the dish to you if you have to wait.",2

There's an extra $0.50 or $1.00 for some of the more premium items (shrimp, added bacon, etc) but it's always worth it.

1182,1,1548979200000,I really don't understand the hype surrounding Dunkin' Donuts. The donuts are mediocre and so was their coffee. The only reason we made a stop here was because the Los Angeles location always had a line wrapped around so we thought we would give this a try.

They make it like Pizza Brutta on Monroe St, where instead of being covered with a layer of cheese it has a few dollops. Novonta pulls that off (Pizza Brutta did too). Novonta's crust was good, and the rest of the pizza was even better. I really got just a plain cheese pizza, but there was more to it. Some sort of Basil or Spinach leaves in there...

By 12:25 our orders - a salad and the fish, both off the specials menu - still hadn't arrived. No server came back to refill our waters, either. Ultimately, after 45 minutes of waiting, we suspected our orders had been missed. She finally came back and explained that the kitchen was backed up with two large groups and that's why we were still waiting. Since we had meetings at 1pm to get to, we asked to have the lunches wrapped up. Cue the broken debit machine - another 10 minute wait to be able to pay for a lunch.

I had the Kobe beef tacos that were a little spicy but great (did not appreciate any noticeable difference in the beef quality though).  The rock shrimp tempura was really good and maybe my favorite thing.  The tuna sushi was very fresh tasting.  I could have passed on the sea urchin - but it's not really my thing.  However, one of my companions who likes this/sea urchin said it was some of the best he has had.  All in all everything was fine, actually fine +.

Perhaps it's time for a little wiggle room for breakfast on weekends or time for Hardee's to evaluate that most places do some breakfast all day.  I ended up with a triple bacon (bacon= breakfast?!?!

1251,1,1550707200000,"It's a local favorite for people who live in the Cave Creek area. The building is split into two venues.  One side is the coffee side.  It opens for those who need an early coffee and maybe a pastry.  They also offer a simple menu of oatmeal, egg/bacon or sausage or what they call their ""Big Ass"" Burrito.  They also have a ""Small Ass"" Burrito if you're not that hungry.  The coffee is their own and  is roasted on the premises.  I love the smell of it when I drive through the town.  Their coffee offerings are equal to what you would find at Starbuck's but they also have some items unique to them.  Their ""Mocaffe"" (Mexican spiced hot chocolate) is one of my faves.

The wine side is open for lunch/dinner time.  The menus are small, and most items would be considered appetizers.  However, the menu is unique enough that you feel like you are getting a little something special. It's always fun to make a meal of apps. Good sandwiches too. They also do a decent pizza.

Monday nights, they offer a $5 price on many of their wines.  It's a good time to try some labels that maybe you aren't used to.
The free WI-FI is a definite plus.  The ambiance is wonderful, overstuffed chairs, art and entertainment in the evening.  I think you'll be pleased.",3

 - you pay before your stay
 - the rooms have numeric keypad entries like houses can have. So remember to lock your door when you leave! We didn't realize this initially
 - the suites with kitchenettes are handy, modern, but very ikea. 
 - the rooms are incredibly hot. The little home sized air conditioning unit doesn't quite do the trick. 
 - our shower plugged up and wouldn't drain on first use. I went down to front desk, they were very pleasant and said they'd send someone the next morning, that they couldn't switch us rooms because the hotel was fully booked. Understandable. At 2pm the next day someone came to look at our shower. Good thing I'd found the plunger labeled 'for shower/sink only' and fixed it myself because we had to be at a wedding by 3. 
 - the morning of our checkout a woman knocked on our door at 9:30 to ask when we'd be ready to checkout. Well, considering checkout is 11, probably around then. (Our room was missing its 'do not disturb' sign). 

So. We had a fine time. The TV worked and the beds were comfortable. It did the trick. But we probably wouldn't stay again.",2

One of the racers actually got ejected from the race. We had paid for two races and after our first one were escorted out of the area.

My massage was very good and seemed to be an adequate ""make up massage"" comparatively, but it still wasn't great.

1309,2,1550275200000,"The only good that came from eating here was that the bill was comped.

Went for dinner 22 April. Everything was fine up until the part where people actually eat, which is a major issue being a restaurant. Two distinctly different dishes were ordered; yellow curry with tofu and Seafood Delight. Hers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I told her to not wait for me and eat, believing my order would be coming out shortly.

Meanwhile, a table of two came in, and was seated at a table that was in my line of sight. They got their drinks, ordered and started to eat

Every so often, staff would peek around to see me, sitting there not eating. Eventually, one of the waitresses comes over.

""Is everything okay?
Everything except I haven't received my order.""

Minutes later...

""Is everything okay?
Is there something wrong in the kitchen? I'm still waiting for my food.""

Her response was that the order slipped through the cracks because of a larger party's (20+) order, which doesn't sound right. The party she was talking about was already seated and eating when we walked in, and the table that was seated in my line of sight came in after us and was already eating. Additionally, our order was taken on one ticket, not two (2) separate orders, so both orders should have been started at the same time

My plate finally shows up, but I'm so upset that I don't eat. For five minutes, I debate whether or not to ask for the manager. And again, every so often the staff would peek around to see me, sitting there and not eating. Was finally persuaded to just eat so we can leave.

We had finished our meals. The male waiter shows up, and asks how things are going. She had asked for a to go container, which was brought promptly. She filled the container with her leftovers, and the dishes were taken away.

We sat around for another 15 minutes. No one bothered to ask if we were ready for our check. That table of two? Already out the door. While we were waiting, we had a talk about her talking with management, because I knew she would be calmer than I would be. We go to the front and had to ask the hostess we would like to pay, but we never received a bill.

""What table was yours?
The table that had to wait over fifteen minutes for my dinner.""

At that point, I pulled $25 out of my pocket, and handed it to her while taking her take out container. Was so livid that I told the hostess that she had something to say to management and I had to leave

She finally came out, and I got the lowdown.

- A lot of apologies were given, but no real action to correct the situation (Which I take as, no one cares enough to follow up)
- Of the three wait staff (2 F, 1 M) who came to our table, not once did the male member mention he was the manager
- Lots of finger pointing going around: waitress(es) believed since the manager came over, he would take care of us; manager believed waitress(es) was still serving us.",2
1312,1,1548979200000,"DO NOT RENT AN APARTMENT HERE.  Law students who really want litigation experience may want to consider it because this place screams ""sue me"" on a regular basis.

1. LIES, DAMN LIES - The employees will lie to you, without a doubt.  I have lost count of the number of times I have been lied to while living here.  We were lied to about the ability to get satellite TV installed, about the state of our apartment on moving in, about regularity of the bus (forget it when school is not in session), the safety of the place, and about so much more.

2. FEES WITHOUT SERVICES - The Village has no qualms about charging a fee for a service they do not provide.  We sublet initially and were told we would have to pay a redecoration fee and would have to leave at least two days between the prior tenant's move-out and our move-in so they could ""redecorate"". When we arrived, of course, the place had not been cleaned let alone redecorated.  When we asked about this, we were told that they never redecorate in sublet situations.  You should not be surprised to hear that the sublessor was not refunded her redecoration fee and neither were we.  In addition, a number of friends were assessed charges for things they had not done, including fines for leaving trash out.  Very questionable behavior.

3. CRIME - Numerous cars had their back windows shot-out while I have been living here, at least three by my count.  The Village refused to do anything in response. 

4. THERE ARE NO SOCCER FIELDS OR BASKETBALL COURTS BEHIND THE VILLAGE - When we signed up, we were shown a nice diagram of Colbert park with all of its facilities, including a soccer field, a basketball court, and an amphitheater.  These things do not exist.  There is some grass and a hill, but it takes some imagination to conjure up what the Village subtly advertises. 

If you're the kind of person who is willing to forgive all manner of misbehavior in exchange for a pool and pizza party every once in a while then by all means move in here.

As a final note, both the Village drivers and maintenance staff are perfectly friendly and seem competent enough.  This review is limited to a critique of the management and office staff who ought to be ashamed of their behavior.",2

What blows my mind is how they used canned??? strawberries. I'm not from Vegas, but I'm hoping fresh fruit isn't that hard to find where restaurants forgo it. They have a preservative taste that once biting into, makes you think that these strawberry slices have been sitting in a plastic container somewhere for a couple of weeks. 

Then... the BANANAS. The bananas are blackish and gummy. Blackish and GUMMY!!! Who uses those words to describe bananas??? These bananas literally look like they mummified before being delivered to me....

And the piece de l'resistance is the French toast. Oh boy. You know the texture of stale bread is like? It rips a certain way, it's fluffy, flavorless, and dry all at the same time? That's this French toast. 

Unfortunately, this entire order reminded me of those questionably ""healthy"" cafeteria breakfasts from high school, slapped together by pissy lunch ladies, but worse. A lot worse.",1

Oh yeah, and the bartenders know their stuff. 

This place also has a great drink selection. I am not a beer connoisseur, but I am always a fan of trying something I have never had before. So when I saw Unibroue La FIn Du Monde on the menu, I had to order it. Really, I just wanted to order a ""Uni-brow"" and I got a good laugh from the bartenders. It was however a great beer :) Aside from my new sampling, they also had a great selection of Weissbier, of which I am a huge fan. I was driving so I did not get the opportunity to try the mixed drinks, but they looked phenomenal! 

The atmosphere was outstanding in general with a fun vibe and good music. The crowd was entertaining to watch and a great mix of people. You could come dressed up or down to this joint and you would be just fine. 

I am definitely coming back to this spot in the future :)",3

In fact she was in such a hurry she forgot to give us our drinks, and when she realized we were still sitting there she opened the window and said ""what do you need?""  Horrible customer service.",2

It was a wonderful experience and I will definitely be going back!",2
1391,1,1550016000000,"I've been here on numerous occasions and love the work that these nail techs do! I often go to Lili for shellac manis. She does an amazing job with nail shape and my shellac polish lasts up to 3 weeks without any chipping or peeling ... which is a rarity for me. Recently I got a pedicure and gel nail extensions by Coco, as I was going on vacation and my nails were really REALLY short. The extensions lasted two weeks, with only one nail coming off by 2.5weeks. However, as I was on vacation I was using my hands a lot and am generally not very gentle with my hands. So 2.5 weeks with no complaints is good enough for me! 

Overall I love the staff and love this salon. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because their prices are slightly more than other nail salons in the area. But considering the quality of service and work that I receive when I come here, I'm completely okay with paying a bit more.",2

Wally & Steve did an excellent job finding what we wanted at a great price! They both went above and beyond our expectations to ensure a positive buying experience. Wally was so friendly and always called us by name. (Our names are often mixed up, but Wally never made that mistake. I appreciate his attention to detail.) He listened to what we wanted, and he was so willing to spend the time showing us all our options. Steve was absolutely amazing! He was honest and transparent. He made us feel like friends, and we quickly trusted his thoughts and opinions. This was a tremendous help for us to weigh all options. The made the whole process enjoyable and stress-free. We are so grateful for their help through his car-buying experience! We are so happy with our new Jeep Wrangler!",2

This location has some issues.

THE PORTION SIZES ARE SO SMALL! I got stuffed mushrooms and they are usually about the size of quarters or larger. These were the size of dimes and burned. I returned them and asked for a fresh plate. The next plate they were very small and dry. Just nowhere near the size or quality I expedited, so I returned them. The manager came and apologized and asked if he could anything to make it better. My wife'se tacos were very small as well, and the tortillas were not the same as the ones used at other locations. Our friend that went along with us said her sandwhich was also very small. Server n didn't bring out bread. Lame.

Great manager, but I won't return. I'll stick with the Chandler Mall.",2

The food was DECENT, at that. The vibe and environment is beautiful. But NOT worth the prices at all. And not to mention, our service was incredibly SLOW, when our server was NOT busy. It's a Tuesday night. We had to ask for things several times before receiving. The whole table was almost finished eating before the birthday guy's food came out because our server never came back to check on us to know it was missing. We were here for TWO hours. 1 person ordered a drink, the rest of us has water, no appetizers or desert and this still took this long.

1444,3,1550620800000,"For the short amount of time that me and friends spent in here, the bar was decent.

Stopped in to use two $50 drinking credits. The crowd was small but had a few live people. The pianist was entertaining asking for song request from the live ones. Drinks were ordered, chugged and it was on to the next bar. The drinks themselves were ok.

Besides the pianist, our bartender Harry was cool. He was straight to the point while offering some laughs. He also refilled a friends drink after it was knocked over which was cool. 

I'm hoping to stop in with a bigger crowd next visit. With all the sound that comes from this bar, one would think it would draw in a crowd especially on a Saturday. Nevertheless, free drinks in Vegas is always a good thing and it was a good thing here.

Jed was by far more thorough and technologically advanced than anyone else.  He spent over 3 hours inspecting the 1000 sq foot condo I was looking at!  
He didn't miss a thing, and his report was emailed less than 24 hrs later, with pictures and explanations of everything.  It was because of him that I was made aware of extensive water damage in one of the walls, and I decided to walk from the property because of it and potential mold issues.  
I'm still house hunting, and I will definitely use Jed every time I need an inspection!",2

1473,3,1550707200000,"Vegan, intimate, delicious, would definitely go back.

First time visit yesterday for some take-out dinner. Let me just say, props to the three sweet women who do EVERYTHING at this great little vegan place. They waitress, cook, clean, and smile on top of it all! Understandably it's a great little place to sit down and take a breather or peruse their small selection of sale items while waiting for take out.

I ordered a tempeh chickenless salad sandwich, artichoke dip, and chai chocolate drink. My vegan experience has been limited, but I LOVED the sandwich, the dip was good, and the drink was SPOT-ON for a humid day. They had a lot of great looking deserts, a small but diverse menu, and a lot of drink options.

The service was as quick as could be expected, those sitting down seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I was patiently tolerated as I tried to figure out what to get.

Definitely would go back and would recommend for a friend.",2
1474,1,1550361600000,Fantastic!  They hit it out of the park.  Such a great vegan selection to choose from.  Everything was fresh.  The soy chicken satay were a great start to our meal.

We family styled the sides and my favorite by far was the spicy rice! YUM! I absolutely loved the fresh mixed cocktails too and the wine list is fabulous.

When I arrived, I was told I was ""early"" when in fact It was 5 minutes early.  I then waited an additional 20 minutes.  I ordered the Chicken Makani amd the Palek Paneer.  The chicken was all gristle and had bones and skin and there were literally 5 small pieces of chicken in it which was of very Poor quailty compared to others I've had  The sauce had a good flavor though.  The Palek Paneer lacked flavor and was also lacking Paneer, which for $13.00 should've been more of it!  I will not be going back to Tadka.",2
1499,3,1551312000000,"I don't usually leave reviews, but I feel our meal at this restaurant deserves one. 

FOOD: The food was great. The oysters were wonderful. We all wanted to try the French onion soup, which they split into half portions for us (unexpected and nice of them to do). The bone in ribeye was perfectly cooked and very good, but the real star was the 10 oz filet. Honestly, I wish I had been the one to order it, because it was one of the best cuts I have ever had. The truffle mashed potatoes were a great addition as a side. 

Overall, the quality of the meat was excellent. I did feel like the steak could have been seasoned more. Other than that, no complaints here. 

SERVICE: Here is where things went a bit downhill. Lets start with the positives - first, the hostess was very nice and sat us at a great spot near the windows to watch the fountains. We were also visited by [who I am assuming is] the manager of the restaurant, who was very quick to respond to any requests we had. These two individuals were not only helpful, but very friendly and personable. 

The negatives - from the very moment we sat down, I got the feeling we were being rushed by our server. There is a difference between being attentive and being overly pushy. Our table felt that we were experiencing the latter. Additionally, we all felt that both servers for our table were relatively unfriendly and standoffish.

I was also unimpressed by the attitude of the individual who split the check. Two of us were in Vegas on business and needed to split the check so that certain dishes were included on different cards. For some reason, this was met with frustration. In fact, the server responsible for the check walked away from me mid-sentence as I was explaining how it needed to be split up. Not a great touch. 

OVERALL: The food and the atmosphere were very good. However, they weren't good enough to make up for the lack of personable/helpful service that you should get if you're paying to eat at an upscale restaurant like Prime claims to be. 

Our family visits Vegas frequently but it's unlikely we will be back due to the service (and the fact that there are so many other great alternatives in the area). I would also hesitate to recommend this for business outings - no need to deal with attitude from the server over splitting the check when there are so many other restaurants who are more than willing to accommodate this type of request.",2
1503,2,1550966400000,"This has been on my bucket list for a while. I came here for restaurant week. My husband called for a reservation and we got sat right away. We were near a window which was nice. The server was friendly. I got the tots and my husband got the mussels. Both were delicious.

 After we got our appetizers, we waited a good 40 mins for our entrees. The server told us that the kitchen was backed up and apologized. No biggie. But when we got served our food, it was two completely different dishes. I got the meatball orzo and my hubs got the snapper. We were served chicken and something else. We told him it wasn't our order and the server looked confused. He took the food back and we waited again for our food. We were done eating our appetizers and saw a couple get sat. They got their appetizers and entrees all while we were waiting on our food. We finally got our food. We were both happy with our orders. The meatballs were delicious and soft. The orzo was cooked really well. My husband's snapper was very fresh and tasty. 

Since we were there for a long time we decided to get our desserts to go. The server said he was sorry again for the confusion and the comped our appetizers. We got the check and saw that the order was put in wrong that's why we waited so long. Overall, it was a good experience. The food made up for it. We would definitely come back to try their regular menu.",3

A fantastic place to bring a close friend or relative for a long conversation.",2
1512,1,1550793600000,Service was unbelievably slow. There was one other table in the restaurant and it took over a half hour to get out me food and took the server over ten min to come to the table for drinks. The good is not worth the price either. $40 for a small salmon and chicken skewers that weren't done well enough. Won't be going back.,2
1514,3,1550016000000,"If you're a college student living near ASU, this place is a go-to spot. The wait is a bit long at times, but it's pretty much worth it. My favorite has got to be the polish with ketchup, onions, tomatoes, bacon, sauerkraut, and some of their hot sauce. What's awesome about this place is the fact that you can put mac and cheese on your hot dog too + you get to see the staff cook it for you on their charcoal grill.

1591,1,1550188800000,"Finally made my visit to Tacos Huicho as my ongoing trek for the best tacos in Arizona continues. Read good reviews by fellow yelpers of this place. I believe they just renovated the dining area as I did not see the broken chairs, sticky tiles, nor limited seating that some yelpers experienced. I was introduced to laminate flooring, new chairs, and fresh smell of paint. Also the fact that they were repairing the bathrooms during business hours was quite frank as you can hear the workers drilling away (it was really loud, quick tip may want to compete repairs before or after business hours). Now to the tacos, they were above average at best as nothing spectacular about it: cabeza, pastor, longaniza, and tripa. There was no salsa bar described by others but bottles of there salsa itself. I gave it an extra star as the price cannot be beat, $1.10 for the three tacos for tacos Tuesday special and $1.50 for the tripa taco! I believe all tacos are $1.50 on a regular day. Total paid was $4.90 for four tacos, which is unheard of nowadays as most tacos shops charge at least $2 per taco. You get more variety here and bang for your buck. Though it won't hit my top 10 tacos shops here in AZ, it definitely lands within the Top 20. I shall come back again and try the rest of their listed tacos!",3

I love this small market as it is far away from the crowdedness of the downtown market with much fewer people and easy parking.
Despite it's size it still offers a large selection of pastries, vegetables, bread, cheese curds, produce, flowers and others. I really like coming here early in the morning and get my weekly produce.

1627,2,1551312000000,"Located inside the Dundas Square AMC building 3rd floor food court.  There were escalators going up the stairs, but we couldn't find the down escalator so we took the elevator down.

The food is cheap, but so is the taste.  I got a Combo #1 (one meat + one vegetable) for $7.  The quantity is generous.  I got steamed rice with the pepper pot steak.  The sauce was a deep red color and the meat tasted ok.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.  This restaurant very much resembles a fast food Chinese take out place.  I wonder if they misspelled ""Carribean"" on their receipt on purpose when it's supposed to be 2 b's instead of 2 r's.  The steamed rice was on the hard side and not that great.  They had jerk chicken and assorted other meat dishes.  I also tried the fried plantain, which was sweet but could be softer.

1631,1,1550966400000,"Stayed for five nights. The staff at this hotel really knows what customer service is all about! 
This review may be longer than most of my reviews but I really need everyone to understand how much the staff anticipated our needs/desires.
Lets start with the front desk. I came in early the first day. I do mean early, there breakfast was still going. All I really needed was the shuttle to pick up my rental car, no problem. Told me what time to be in the lobby for the next shuttle, which was less than 20 minutes. So I just waited in the lobby. While I'm sitting there they called me to the desk and handed me my room keys! I'm like are you for real, but sure, that's great. 
I went to pick up my rental car then came back to take things up to my room. These rooms are very spacious. I was thrilled with a microwave and refrigerator as well. Ice machines available on each floor by the elevator. Just how convenient can it get.
Housekeeping is next. Wow, once again. The first morning we left a note for them to leave a couple of extra coffees. When we returned that night lets just say they made sure we had more than enough, regular and decaf. Everyday it was at least noon or later before we headed out for the day, and our room was still cleaned everyday. The last day, we stayed in the room till 2pm before we left and we returned around 6pm. To our surprise the room had not been refreshed, but we understood and didn't really need anything but coffee. Then a few minutes later housekeeping came by and all was perfect. All this without having to ask for anything.
Our last day, they where able to let us stay as long as we needed, since they still had availability that night. They just asked us to let them know when we where done.
The breakfast is pretty standard at Hampton inn. They always have some sort of egg and protein as well as waffles, cereals and pastries. I do wish that the Hampton chain would do something about the egg/protien selection.  Very limited and the eggs seem to always we way overcooked with very little flavor. This is a problem with the chain, and not this particulair hotel.   
My only complaint is about families with children. I love kids but please make them throw there candy wrappers away. Everyday the pool was littered with candy wrappers, and I know the hotel was cleaning the pool area. Sometimes we have to do our part. 
I see several comments on people making comments about the airport right next door.  Yes, if you are a light sleeper then the planes may just keep you awake, but I believe you would have to be a light sleeper.  If youve ever stayed at a hotel near LAX, then this is nothing compared to them.

I went here twice during my stay. The first visit was absolutely mindblowing. I had a chicken burger, which was perfectly cooked, and the organization of the toppings was excellent. The second visit was good but not as good; the burger just seemed rushed. It still tasted pretty good but was a little dry and toppings were added unevenly.

The shakes are delicious and come in large portions. I wasn't a big fan of the hard shakes, but that's probably personal preference.

The wait times can be kind of long, and afaik, you can't make reservations ahead of time.. I suggest you come in between traditional lunch and dinner times for the shortest wait. I came at around 4-5 pm and was seated fairly quickly.",1
1643,2,1549843200000,"My friend and I were visiting Vegas and we were looking through yelp and noticed this place had 5 STARS with over 1000+ reviews. WHAAAAT?  I rarely see that!... So we drove 20 minutes from the strip to try this place out.

Yelp reviews did not fail us.  OMG!  The only regret we had was not getting a LARGE!
I got their regular size Cold brew with Sea Salt cream and Boba...and my friend got the Hokkaido with Sea Salt cream.  

You get to choose the Level of Sweetness!

GET THE LARGE! (We would've went back in line to get another one, but the line was long).

SEA SALT CREAM? Who thought of this brilliant idea? 

They also had crepes (which looked delicious) and other fruity drinks. Other toppings, other than boba, for your drink as well.

Small space with few tables. Loud and not the best place to study or do work.  More of a buy and bounce type of place. 

Definitely recommended! 20 minutes drive for a drink was worth it!",2
1644,1,1550966400000,"Do not rent here ever- I lived here for about 13 months. The front gates do not close. ever--- they will tell you they close at dusk and open at sunrise, but they only actually worked for about 1 month of the time i lived here. When you ask them about this they state that they are having trouble with them, and have had 3 different companies come out to see them.. The walking gates are never closed either, and even if they do, the front fence  by the mail room and fountain is rusted, so you could get thru it if you were a smaller person


   There are homeless people that come in and rummage thru the garbages , when chandler, one of the office staff was asked about this she told me to call glendale pd next time..

  Speaking of glendale pd they are there on a montly basis, and  when this is brought to the attention of the office staff ,to see if me as a single woman getting home at 1 or 2 am needs to be worried about anything, they never have any explanation,aside from the fact that yes there has been some dificulty with one of the residents..
  
   The mainatance ppl are extremely adept at smoking and driving golf carts, tho they seem to do little else...I have seem more control panels on the buildings open then i can count, the pool gates  dont always open from the inside, you need a key on the outside lock to get out from the inside, there is more light bulbs in the ouside lighting out then that actually works, and that is for the light fixtures that are still standing-- there was on that got knocked down on july 4 weekend and was still lying on the ground when i moved out on the last weekend of august.  oh and some of the other things ive found while walking my dogs on the property is used needles lying by the gym, swarms of bees, a million ferral cats...

    Which brings me to the office staff.God help you if you have a problem because the 3 of them couldnt find their way out of a paper bag-- Chandler cant remember anything form one day to the next, you can have packages that get delivered , but the staff cant seem to find them because they label them with the wrong apartment number....

They will call and tell you that the people around you complained that you were noisy and they dont know if you were having a party or not,but you need to be more considerate of your neighbors--A direct quote from chandler, and when you contact her to tell her that there must be a mistake because you work until 1 am, and werent even home that night, she has no idea what you are talking about... when i gave my notice I was given a move final price by chandler,  then a day later i was called by another office staff who gave me another number for my final rent. When i questioned this she got huffy with me and stated that she was the book keeper and did i want her to go over the books with her.. When i state no, i just wanted to know how i got 2 different numbers in 2 days,especially after a call to verify that i was moving out and when because apparently chandler got confused at to what i wanted and the dates of these things, even thought they have a form you fill out...that i handed to chandler...when i paid my last rent for 3 days of september i was given a third price,which happened to be the least expensive.  If you havent guessed i cannot say enough negative things about this place-- it was a means to an end for me, but i wouldnt let anyone rent here ever















  The maintanence people seem to be very adept at smoking and driving golf carts around, but i rarely see them do any work--I had a upper unit that had a ac that leaked onto my floor between my kitchen and bathroom,.when i asked them about this last year when i moved in i was told that this is normal for arizona,   when it happend again this year i called and spoke with chandler again, who also told me that it is completely normal for arizona.. when i explained to her that i have lived in az for 12 years and never had this occur anywhere but here she told me that it is their units specifically, and normal. When asked if they would cover cost for the mold that occured form the leaking and heat she told me no...",2

1696,3,1551225600000,"Came here for a little afternoon treat with my friend. We arrived when the place just opened and was greeted by the owner himself. He seem to be the only person running the place. He directed us to the menu that was placed across from the cash register. 

Note: you order first then seat yourself. There's a water station if you get thirsty and also a bin where you would place your dirty dishes in after you're done.

Always enjoyed creme brûlée and I was super excited to try one of his many creations. He offer a variety of interesting flavours that all sound so yummy. I chose the Vietnamese coffee paired with a scoop of earl gray ice cream. The creme brûlée was tasty, coffee flavour was strong, it was drizzled with condense milk and I enjoyed watching it being torched infront of me. I felt that the earl gray ice cream was definitely needed or some kind of ice cream because it helps to balance out the sweetness and rich flavour of the Vietnamese flavour creme brûlée. The ice cream was made perfect in my opinion as earl gray taste was present, it was creamy and not overly sweet. The owner actually recommended to have the ice cream first then my creme brûlée after in my particular pairing. 

Moreover, the atmosphere of this place was pleasing and comfortable. You can study or hang out with your group of friends. He definitely made use of every square footage of this place. Also the selection of desserts from ice cream to creme brûlée and waffles. I will definitely come back to try the waffles because the pictures I've seen on yelp look so yummy.",2

Rice Paper DOES IT DIFFERENT AND DOES IT WELL! Its like sushi meets a burrito is the best way I can describe it, I could have ordered one of everything off the fresh spring roll menu.

Stopped in here on a whim and tried some fried tofu and a glass of beer. Okay, things went well, taste was good so on to the spring rolls. The rolls had great texture and were full of fresh ingredients with tasty dipping sauce.

Great place to eat (additional parking to the north) and the bill for two was under $20.

Hay rides, animals (donkeys and chickens), a little play area, and outdoor seating for the parents. The fields are wide and easy to get to. I adore the strawberries here because they taste so different that ones you buy in the store. These are alive and still have the energy of the earth. The best part is that it's around the same price as store bought but instead you can support a local farm.

You can either pick your own berries or buy ones pre-picked. Go have some fun and pick your own! You pay inside a little barn full of homemade goodies like jam, breads and donuts. The only downside is on hot days they shut down the pick-yourself option for berries because it gets dangerous. Go early for the best weather.

1757,2,1549411200000,"Overall Duke's Upper Deck was a nice atmosphere and seemed like an after work hang out for the locals of all ages mid 20s and up.

PARKING
- Duke's has a small parking lot for maybe 15ish cars but since it was full, we had to find parking on the very steep hill with limited spaces available. Heels and hills are still not a favorite combination of mine. I am still not sure about parking rules in PA since I'm from TX but we didn't get towed so I guess that's good. 
 
BEER
- My husband raved about the beer selection and he wasn't off. This place has one of the largest draft beer selections of all the places I've been to so far. The happy hour prices can't be beat either!

FOOD
- The hubby and I shared onion rings which were pretty good. I like to think I am not a picky person but my French Dip was not a favorite. The meat was overcooked, bland, and dry. The as jus sauce was decent but could not make up for the thing that was missing. I would have to add horseradish or something if I every ordered it again. The fries were amazing! I ate half my husbands plate ]:). My husband had the bleu burger which came out Well done even though he ordered medium but overall he was satisfied with his meal.  

SERVICE
- We sat at the downstairs bar area and although it was busy, it was not chaotic enough receive the lackluster service that we did. It seems like the wait staff was working 3-4 tables in our area and some tables on the upper deck of the interior building. Our waters ran out multiple times, my husband was able to finish a beer long before another one was ordered, and we maybe saw her about 2 or 3 times during the whole meal. I can't give the place more stars because of the service experience but I would go back on a slower night or during weekend lunch to give it another chance.",2

1763,3,1549238400000,"The one-star rating is based solely on our recent visit for happy hour.  Previous visits merited satisfied customers, including my friend's fiancee who is notoriously hard to please (he's not so much picky as a perfectionist with high expectations for quality food).

When deciding where to go for our February Girls Night, after considering other favorites, we settled on BLT, as it had been a few months since we enjoyed their happy hour.  Apparently, in those few months, their quality has declined.

Due to a current medical condition, I ordered Pellegrino sparkling water.  My friend ordered iced tea, out of solidarity.  Boring I know, but it's not like we only got plain old tap.  We ordered, sharing their fantastic popovers (which were still pretty darn good, despite the rest of the evening's shortcomings), the fried calamari and a burger.  We were served the popovers and before we took a second bite, there was a runner hovering, wanting to deliver our calamari and burger.  Really?  Rushing us out the door?  Despite it being tourist season, neither the bar nor restaurant were at all busy.  Someone screwed up by not pacing our order to come out at varied times.

In a nod to my current condition, I'd been cautioned to avoid undercooked meat.  Normally I am a big fan of rare to medium rare beef, especially in a place supposedly known for quality products.  I just can't bring myself to order well done, so we compromised, requesting the burger medium.  I figured that would be safe enough.  

We continued to enjoy the popovers and the calamari.  The calamari was good, and I enjoyed the green herbal/garlic aioli sauce on the side.  When we finally cut the burger, it was rare plus at best, a far cry from the medium ordered.  Despite the cute little plastic tag sticking out of the bun suggesting the kitchen had heeded our request, they clearly had not.

Our waitress stopped by to check on us and we pointed out the error with our burger.  I explained to her that normally we love the cow practically still mooing, but due to my current status, I need to avoid rare beef.  She offered to have the kitchen correct their mistake.  A few moments later, the food runner brought a burger back to us.  The original burger is served uncut.  This one was cut in half.  At first we thought it was a bit suspicious, but maybe the kitchen cut it to make sure they cooked this one correctly, or perhaps they cut it as they knew we were sharing.  We each took a bite and were sorely disappointed to realize we received our original burger, not a freshly made one cooked to our desired doneness.  The kitchen just took our original burger (which sat at room temperature for at least 25 minutes while we ate our other food), slapped it back on the grill until it was charred on the outside, and put it back on the bun.  It was still rare inside.  This is the kind of thing I would expect from Ruby Tuesday, not Laurent Tourondel's namesake.  Upon closer  inspection, the slice of bacon was even sticking out of the bun at the same angle as the original.  

We debated ordering something else, and decided to try dessert instead.  After waiting and waiting for our waitress to return, we just wanted to get out of there and satisfy our sweet tooth elsewhere.  The waitress finally appeared and asked if she could clear the plates.  I wasn't really going to make a big deal of the uneaten burger, but when she didn't even ask  why we hadn't eaten it, I had had enough.  I graciously informed her that we were done with the burger as it was quite obvious the kitchen didn't make us a new one, only re-fired our incorrectly cooked first burger.  She stated she would remove the burger from our check, which we appreciated.  We asked for the check, which we received fairly promptly.

Waiting another 20 minutes for our waitress to return and collect the folio with a card sticking out of the top, we finally decided to just leave cash and get out of there.

It was most definitely a disappointing experience.  When I relayed the events to my husband, he suggested we might give them one more try.  I will have to think about that, considering there are so many other places that have never disappointed me.",2
1771,3,1551225600000,"Here's how I justify my four-star rating:

The sound system is good, better than many places in the Kensington Market area, what with the common problem of clubs limiting the low-end because neighbors live cheek-to-jowl. Add to this the fact that the cover at this club is usually moderately low and nearby clubs often cost twice as much for the same beer and comparable musical selection. Friendly staff and the intimate size of the space make this an enjoyable place to see a show with a group of friends. It's around average space-wise.

It's a great place to just sit and watch a lot of entertaining shit go down and blend in with the crazies if you're up for it, but after dealing with a lot of idiotic drivers and drunk tourists on the strip I dread driving on it. The taxis run you off the street and typically drive like jerks. The pedestrians rule the strip, but that doesn't mean you have the green light to prance around like a tourist fool. Oh you're crossing the street when you shouldn't be and you got hit by a moving vehicle? Sorry, not sorry.

If people watching bores you, the street performers are always out full force on the weekends, just make sure to tip them if you take a photo of them/ with them - if not, get ready to be professionally mean-mugged or verbally assaulted. Or you can be cool and take a picture for free with a bum - your choice. There are a lot of free sights to see - I always enjoy a classic Bellagio water fountain show, it never gets old. Also, the Volcano fire show at The Mirage is pretty thrilling and heats things up, literally!

I can't even count the amount of times I've gone here with a group of girls and the waitresses have had to manage trays and trays of frozen cosmo's (which, like many have mention, at about $3 for happy hour = awesome). They have a vast and eclectic cocktail menu; another of my favorites from which is their caramel appletini with a floating apple slice in it.

I'm also a big fan of their food; most notable the buffalo chicken dip which has a really strong, zesty flavor and their Thanksgiving burger (ground turkey w/ cranberry, a little bit of gravy sauce, and mash potatoes on the side). Also, who can forget free bacon Tuesdays? This place has it all.",2

The Flamingo in Las Vegas is in a convenient location on the strip a stone's throw from some of the major casinos and resorts. The staff is extremely professional and amicable. We dealt with Brian at the front desk and Jeanette in guest services both of whom were friendly.

Cons

Despite it's nice location, the room itself was rather gross. To start, the rates online were different than those that we paid. We wanted to pay in cash so we figured we would be better off making the reservation in person. After watching 3 desk agents get up and never come back there was a crowd full of people with only 2 staff members present. After finally making it to the front after 35 or 40 minutes the rates that we ended up paying were not those online but we were both so tired it wasn't even worth bringing up. Five minutes after putting our bags down we realized we made a mistake booking the hotel and wish we had only paid for one night upfront instead of two. There were black stains on the white shower curtain, hairs on the ceiling, mildew in the shower, no fan in the bathroom, no towel hooks in the wall and nicks on the wall. I was looking forward to taking a bath upon arrival but as soon as I saw the tub I knew I would wait until I went back home. Some of the appliances in the room were unplugged forcing us to move the furniture to plug it in ourselves. The sheets were coming off the bed and continued to do so for the rest of our stay. In terms of the WiFi, it was decent but on the slow end and only allowed for 2 devices to be connected at once. The room did not come with a refrigerator or microwave and if we wanted a fridge it was an additional $15 per night not including taxes. There was a constant and unpleasant odor that permeated throughout our room for the 2 nights we stayed. The walls are rather thin so when the people staying to the left of us were in their room we could actually hear the conversation clearly...from our bed...across the room. To top it off the air conditioner was extremely loud and rather irritating. The pools were alright. The pool for those over 21 looked fun but busy while the beach club pool was extremely overcrowded. We left before we even sat down after considering paying the $200 for a cabana just so we would not have to sit an inch away from strangers on either side of us. In addition you weren't allowed to bring water and bags are searched. If water is found they will make you throw it away or the security will not allow you in. Despite the friendliness of the staff and it's location I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. Overall it was a rather gross experience. Honestly if I could have I would have gone back downstairs and immediately after check in and asked for a refund but we couldn't do so without a cancellation fee so we decided to stick it out. I wish we had though. 

The two nights before, we stayed in Tuscany Casino just off the strip and both of us wish we hadn't left. Even though it was 10 mins farther by walking we were better off with a more low key pool, and a room 3 times the size for a better price. Don't make the same mistake we did. Either pay more for a better hotel or stay at Tuscany if you don't mind walking farther.",2

The cleanliness and ambiance of the lobby and facilities was amazing, I felt like I was at the spa, not getting my eyes checked. I only had to wait a couple minutes, and while I was waiting, was shown what frames I could shop from that the voucher included. I went in knowing I just wanted a basic pair, so I was happy with the selection. (I noticed a lot of incredibly stylish higher-end selections, that if I had the extra money at the time, I probably would've been very tempted to buy!) I received a lot of personal attention, and my glasses were mailed to me for a very affordable rate. (I was about to move out of state within days, and they squeezed me in last minute!)

The shrimp had a weird taste to it and I couldn't even force myself to eat it.  The smell was kind of turning me off.  I looked at the nice selection of desserts and noticed that they had Tiramisu (oooh tiramisu), it was okay.  Washed it down with a Vanilla Milkshake...it was good, not too extra extra sweet, lol I can actually taste milk (lol I hope that made sense).

The pita was great-- fresh pita, moist chicken, perfect amount of sauce. The hummus was also very good and you get a ton of it, along with pita bread. Unfortunately, although I like it, the chipotle flavor didn't go with the chicken souvlaki. I think next time I would sub a salad.",3

Today was my Birthday and of course wanted to go to my ALL time FAVORITE breakfast spot, US EGG. Our server was wonderful, I think her last/first name was Galloway?  I told her it was my birthday so I was gonna order a mimosa with my coffee. I also decided to order something different today. I ordered off the secret menu and got their jalapeño scramble! So delicious and I loved the fresh jalapeños! It wasn't very spicy which was nice!!! Towards the end of the meal she brought me out a complimentary protein pancake for my Birthday! So amazing! I was so shocked and happy!

1927,3,1550534400000,"If only 0 stars was an option: Worst haircut ever. 

After moving to Toronto for the summer I realized that I would need to get a haircut at some point while I was here. After doing a bit of research I found this place and saw that they had a Groupon. I bought the Groupon and booked a hair appointment which ended up being with Azar. 

When i got there, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist and served tea and biscuits as others described (pretty normal for any higher end hair salon) and was brought to my seat. Azar and I spoke about how I wanted a small trim, keeping my hair long which is the way I liked it. From the start it seemed as though she wasn't really listening to what I was saying and had her own vision for what she wanted to do. However, when she showed me what she wanted to cut off, which was approximately 1 inch, I thought that it would all end up ok because WHO can't do a basic trim!? Apparently Azar can't. 

I walked out today with approximately 3-4 inches off of my hair, not a trim by anyone's standards. I was holding back tears the whole way home because of how horrible it is. Not only that, but she did not layer my hair as I asked nor did she straighten my hair like I requested. She instead, did some form of weird blowout saying that she thought I might like it ""naturally straightened"" and then when i reminded her i wanted it actually straight, she did a half-ass job to try and please me.

I'm sorry Azar, you are extremely nice but you need to learn to listen. I have always loved my hair and now I can't stop crying at the sight of it.

P.S. If that wasn't enough, there was a deep-conditioning treatment included in the Groupon which involved sitting under heat to activate it. I was told she would be back in 10 minutes, however I was left stranded under this boiling heat for 20-25 minutes.",2

A lot of clothing in Vegas is either too high end, cheaply made and/or slutty. You can get a conventional look at places like Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom or Macy's but this store has a few edgy styles that are not so memorable that you can't wear them whenever you want without pausing to think, ""when was the last time I wore this?""

I saw the sign, and since I enjoy Pappadeaux, but it's so far- I was game.

You walk up and order, I was looking for creole or cajun food, then asked re: Shrimp Ettoufee-which is a tricky dish I guess, but a good test run.

He said oh yes! So I ordered it. It came with a super delicious salad and rice. I just had water, and it was very good and cold and served in a canning jar-nice portion. Ok...so far so good. 

The salad was soooo good-it was very fresh, diverse and delicious! I had the Creole ranch dressing-which I liked a lot. PLUS!

Then after a bit of a wait the Ettoufee arrived. It looked a bit different, but there was a lot of the brown gravy (it was clear though-kinda weird). The shrimp were pretty small, maybe a ""small-medium"" size, which were really one bite each. There were enough not to feel cheated, not enough to feel you could have a shrimp with every bite (I cut them in half to try).

The shrimp were not overcooked-a plus. But the gravy? It was...BLAND! If there was ANY spice in it at all...well, there couldn't have been! I did not order it bland, nor did he ask. I have had it several times in different states, and I have had worse and I have had much better too. 

It was like eating...shrimp in brown gravy. Period. Cajun? NO WAY.

As a former bartender I enjoy showing support & dine at the bar when I go out. When we walked in, it was pretty dead, but because the menu had a lot to offer, and the hostess was sweet, we decided to take a seat at the bar. 
There were 3 Female bartenders & 2 Male bartenders. A bartender greeted us right away, she had long black hair & made a very good White Russian, which surprisingly so many people mess up, so we were excited for our meals. We ordered Buffalo Chix Dip, and a Mac & Cheese Flatbread, which came out in under 10 minutes. 

I really do hate leaving bad reviews, but I really had too....

The female bartenders were super friendly and gorgeous, but acted extremely inappropriate and immature. It was about 7pm, and dead..... and the bartenders were the loudest there, ""twerking"" on each other, as there are couples trying to enjoy their meals.... Awkward- girl come on you're gorgeous have some class. Not to mention, as they were having fun doing that... we were patiently waiting to order some food, which is when a male bartender took our order as he saw us waiting.

I finished my White Russian before my meal even came, and the food was out in about 6 minutes after we ordered it in, but tasted rushed and awful....

The Buffalo Dip tasted like complete ONIONS. It was super super chunky and the cheese was not melted all the way..
The Mac & Cheese Flatbread looked amazing, but i picked up a slice to a soggy thin piece of dough, but the bottom was burnt.... This had been our second meal all day, so we ate it. 

During the entire time of my meal, I was not offered a second drink. The girls were on the other side of the bar where it was empty, taking selfies, and twerking. FINALLY!!! The red hair chick who is extremely gorgeous by the way finally comes and leans against the bar, as I went to make eye contact with her and ask for another drink, she lets bout 3 huge BURPS! (BELCHES). I was mid meal, and disgusted... Really girl c'mon have some class people are eating... so I didn't even bother asking.

Meal is over, and then a blonde female bartender asks if I want another drink AFTER our meal is finished and plates are stacked... We politely decline, and she walks away seeing cleared dirty plates. 

The male bartender comes over, and we ask for our check, he runs our cards, comes back for us to sign. As he was cleaning our place, he did not bother to ask how our meals were, which I would have politelty told him my review personally instead of writing a bad one online. Even worse, as we get up from the chair never said a word. 

AWFUL SERVICE, and I would not recommend this place to anyone. Its sad you're located right in the EpiCentre, and run such a poor establishment like that. Hope to hear of improvement to get me to try it again.",1

2091,3,1550620800000,"I've flown with Virgin America at least time times and have had nothing short of a positive experience each time.  Far and away my favorite airline.   

Here's a few of the reasons I love Virgin America, in no particular order.   I'm just crossing my fingers that with the Delta merger their quality stays. 

1.) Group Reservations.  I have booked trips from SF to DC  on VA for five consecutive years for a group of 10 students + myself.   Their group reservation folks are super responsive and really easy to work with.

2.) Price.  Each time I have flown with Virgin, they have been very competitive... at or near the least expensive, while offering a far superior quality.   

3.) Airport staff.  When flying with kids, they have always shown tremendous respect and kindness to them... treating them with dignity.   

4.) Flight crew.  Kind, professional, and responsive, without exception.   

5.) Policies.  They don't try to take advantage of you when there is a mishap.   For the first time in my life I missed a flight.   They offered me free standby on the next flight or $35 to have a guaranteed seat.  They were empathetic to my situation, not annoyed by my error.   

6.) In-flight entertainment/WiFi;    I love the music selection and making a playlist for the flight.   The WiFi is reasonably priced and reliable.   Their are 3-prong plugs that work for my laptop in coach.

7.) Leg room:  I'm 6'3"" and I am comfortable in coach.  

8.) The ambiance, hipness, and their safety video... I'll leave other reviewers to offer up details about this.",1

It wasn't my first wax but certainly the best one I've ever had. I love how they use two types of wax in order to give a smoother and longer lasting waxing experience.

If you are anywhere near Pittsburgh I highly recommend you stop by and try one of their OVERSIZED sandwiches. 

Their veal parmigiana is double stacked, moist inside yet crispy outside. Perfectly fried; not soggy. Then it's covered with their homemade sauce & fresh mozzarella and served on a big delicious soft Italian roll.

The meat sub is equally as good. They put four HUGE delicious meatballs smothered in sauce & mozzarella on a Italian hoagie. Ba Da Bing! 

Good luck trying to finish off one of their large sandwiches.",2

I just can't. It's the ""motel hotel"" of LV casinos, ranking slightly higher than Terrible's. 

From the car park to the layout of this ""locals"" joint, I don't care for it at all. There's always a funky stench. I've had food poisoning in the Cafe. The restaurants here aren't good & barely decent. And yeah, that goes for Steak & Shake, an over rated, get what you pay for, dump. There is nothing about South Point that would inspire me to return, or want to return. The decor alone is plain & unappealing. It's very boring.

They also have nice fire pits at nite with smores each night. Staff were very pleasant. Patio and Adirondack chairs are a comfortable feature. Beds are comfy with down comfortable and pillows. Tub is not great but if you are not here to take a tub bath, all is good. Two separate mirror areas for getting ready is an added feature. They have ihome alarm and ipod set up for music etc. The only thing I could say as a negative is that there is a minor smell to the room each time you come in.

2158,3,1549670400000,"We happened upon Wild Fusion because we were in the area for a soccer game and needed to work dinner into the evening. The positive Yelp reviews brought us here.

Let me start by saying that this place puts other Chinese takeout spots to shame on so many levels. I'll try to name them all:

1. It is nice, bright, and super clean.
2. It has a real wooden table with real wooden chairs AND a nice little sushi bar for those who choose to eat in. Those who have attempted to ""eat in"" at your typical Chinese carryout place will know why this is mentioned.
3. Staff is friendly.
4. Non-canned vegetables are used in their dishes.
5. The chicken was much more high-quality than the norm at such places.

We shared 2 sushi rolls, a dumpling appetizer and the garlic chicken. Food was well prepared and came out fairly quickly. Everything was very good, with the sushi being a pleasant surprise.

If we're in the area, we'd definitely eat here again.",2

2195,1,1549584000000,"Not recommended. I booked and was told I would be picked up at my hotel and taken to a ticketing office and there would receive tickets for the USBR 1 hr tour of Hoover Dam for $132. Instead after  paying they gave me a different tour, NO offer of a full refund. I did not receive the Hoover dam tickets. When I called I was told I booked with their agency so they were not responsible for not providing what I paid for. The booking agency said they weren't responsible either. After over a month of back and forth including talking to managers for Airbridge and Best Tours I was given $33 back as ""FULL"" compensation. I paid $132. The face value of the tickets I did not receive alone was $90 so definitely not a happy customer. I was even less satisfied when I complained and $33 not even being the cost of the tickets I did not receive and still being out $99 and having never received the tour learning that the Airbridge Manager and Best Tour manager had talked and it was decided ""You have been compensated"" ""You got exactly what you wanted.""

If I were to go again, which I will be to actually see the dam, I am renting a car and avoiding the bus tour. The bus ""tour"" was about an hour and a half driving behind motels and hotels, did not include fund Hoover Dam facts on route, and did not include Hoover Dam tour tickets which in the advertisement were included. Instead it was a $132 bus ride to walk outside the dam and see the visitor center. Definitely not worth it.",2

Nothing else was available. Not a great first impression.
Our room has a great view but it also has mascara and blue eyeshadow all over the bathroom floor. Obviously the floor was NOT CLEANED.
The cocktail waitresses in the casino were rude and so was the woman who gave us our Togo food at Johnny Rockets.

The tech arrived when they said he would. I explained my issue and he had it fixed within minutes. He also gave me some preventive maintenance tips which I can do in order to keep my AC units operating at their best. The best part......I only paid the $75.00 for this repair.

I purchased a MacBook Pro laptop 3 months and 12 days ago to replace a 2010 MacBook Pro.  The new MacBook Pro had a defective battery and would not boot. I met with the manager and asked about the time required to have it repaired. He said the earliest he could promise the repaired MacBook Pro was 3-5 days. Since this is the one computer that I use for my business, I asked if Apple would return my money or provide me with a replacement laptop. He said under no circumstances would Apple do so. A high end laptop should not have a battery fail after 3 months. Also, because of the way components are installed on the new MacBooks, it will be necessary to replace the memory chip as well. I will lose all of my data. The manager was polite but had no suggestions. A business cannot afford to be without a computer for a week. I have been a Mac user since 1984.

We were hopeful to sit out in the patio area but when we realized it was 90 degrees outside and patio was not really cooled down we opted for the inside area. We were actually seated downstairs (which I didn't know they have) and it was wonderful. 

The Food. I had the gnocchi, with was absolutely delicious. Not too heavy and balanced out nicely with the fennel, asparagus and lobster. Someone else at our table had the pork chop and was very pleased. We all opted for dessert as well. My creme brûlée was wonderful and I appreciated the addition of some fresh strawberries, (instead of the usual raspberries) since they are in season. Everyone was very pleased with their meals. 

My only side comment is the kitchen/bar seemed to be a bit slow. Our waitress was wonderful and on top of things. Filled up our water glasses as much as she could while we waited. We did have to inquire about our drinks because it just seemed to be taking a while and we didn't order any special cocktails.

2325,2,1551312000000,"Was excited to have a dim sum place in Madison. We ordered a bunch of different dishes. 7 total which is a bit too much for two people but we're able to take them home. 

We were disappointed in the Xiao Long Buns (Baos). There was no juice in them. Typically, you eat these with a spoon. You place one on a spoon and nibble some of the top off. Then you proceed to slurp out the super yummy juice. Anyways, these are more like steamed dumplings though the meat was very mushy and wouldn't hold its shape. It seemed like they used a lot of fillers, possibly flour, that made the meat act this way. 

I would recommend the pot stickers instead though there were a LOT of chives. 

The deep-fried dough sticks was the best dish we had. It's best to eat these hot. 

Although they do mention *picture for reference only, please prevail in kind* on the menu, it was disappointing to get no veggies in the vegetable crepe. There are absolutely no greens on the dim sum menu. Instead it was filled with different types of fungi. It would have been nice to have some real veggies in it. 

On to the sweets - the deep-fried sesame balls are good. The outer shell was a bit harder and crunchier than I have had before, but overall they were tasty. 

The puffy egg custard tarts are good though the shell is a bit in the buttery side. The flavor is good though. 

The service was good and attentive. They speak both English and Mandarin. I didn't hear any other dialects when I was there. 

If you have never been to a dim sum place, they will walk you through it. Basically, just mark down how many of the dishes you want. You can always request more later. Each dish will come one at a time so expect a wait in between dishes. 

For those who have had good dim sum, you may be disappointed. Things are on the greasy and salty side, as others have mentioned.",2

2340,2,1549065600000,Was craving sushi after my dentist office and found this. It's a small menu of sushi so pls check it out before you drive/call in. It's not s typical sushi place. The decor inside was outdated but it didn't stop the food from tasting pretty good. Not the best I've had but pretty good! They have the basic rolls that made me happy. I got a salmon roll and rainbow roll for $16.,2
2347,2,1548979200000,"I go to the Fairmount fairly often, but only out of convenience.  It is within walking distance of my apartment so if my roommate and I want to grab a quick  drink this is where we tend to go.  However, I am moving to Lakewood in a few weeks and I wouldn't say it is worth the drive. 

They have a pretty good Martini, Wine, and Beer list, better than most places located on the east side.  However, they can be pretty expensive, so I usually limit myself to two dirty vodka martinis which is already over $20.   The food is okay,  I wouldn't recommend going here for dinner, but a light appetizer for happy hour instead.   They do have a happy hour with martinis around $6 which is definitely worth it.

The patio is nice when it gets warmer out and there tends to be a lot of people out there.  However, the one night only the patio was open (they didn't have anyone working inside), so if you are not a fan of outdoor drinking/eating, you may want to reconsider going here if that is the case.  

The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable about every drink they have on their menu.  They make decent recommendations with the wine, sometimes I have been a little disappointed.",2

There is one small table there so if you're lucky, you might find it vacant.  I tried their lunch special which was rice (well cooked - too many places serve mushy rice which drives me crazy so this was a pleasant surprise), steamed vegetables (still crunchy which was a nice touch), and jerk chicken.  I must say that the jerk chicken was beautifully cooked and seasoned.  I devoured it within minutes.  The smell of the chicken barbecuing outside on the grill was enticing to say the least.  I can't wait to come back and try their other stuff like curry goat, curry chicken, or ackee and salt fish.  Seems to be a popular place as there was quite a line-up (went quickly though).

We waited 1 hour to get in which was not a problem because it was expected being that it's Memorial Day weekend. Once we get to the front we stand there for another 5-7 mins and then the doorman told us that our guy friend could not get in because he was wearing camouflage print. He began to state that women can wear whatever they want but men can not. We asked if there was anything anywhere stated about the dress code because we tend to recommend this place to a lot of our guest that stay at our resort. He said it's corporate that has these dress codes in place. So still confused and embarrassed we begin to get out of line he whispered to us that if we slide him something he will talk to management and let us in. At that point we are all offended because is that the dress code or not because I can give you money on the low to get in and then on top of that still pay $40 just to get in. So how is that ok to tip the doorman so he can speak to the manager to allow my friend in. Had we had ""slid him something"" would we have been kicked out once security or a manager spotted my friend in his camouflage and have to leave?! That was the worst experience and the fact that we had other friends who were planning on coming that night was a huge mistake and I can no longer recommend this place to anyone else because of the bad service from the doorman.",2

I ordered the lamb cubes in a stew with tomato, onion and pepper. It came with 2 sides. I requested no butter or milk in my order since I'm dairy-free; I'm guessing there was some butter but I couldn't say for certain.  I've only had Ethiopian food a couple times so I don't know the proper names. The complex flavors were absolutely delicious!  

I usually don't love injera (because it falls apart so easily) but Red Sea's injera had  more texture and flavor than the 2 others I've tried!  The lamb could have been more tender but for $12 and change, it was worth it.",2

A friend brought me here once and I would come here twice a week if it weren't so far from my home.  Instead, it has become something to look forward to, which is just fine by me.  Yes, it's the kind of place worthy of a special trip.

My favorite is the ""wet"" chorizo burrito and the little asada tacos.  Very authentic and totally yummers.  Service is always prompt and friendly, and they also serve three different salsas with their chips, giving a good variety between people who love spicy salsa and people (wussies) who can't handle too much heat (like me).  

Definitely try this place.",2
2391,1,1550534400000,"We saw the El Cortez sign shining brightly in the night a block or so away from the Fremont Street Experience and couldn't resist walking down to check it out.  Talk about stepping back in time.  The place looks really old, but that's because it is.  It's apparently kind of a historical landmark.

The casino and public areas were clean and maintained, but it was a bit smokey.  Quite a few people were playing slots and the table games.  We sat down at a roulette table to play awhile.  Unfortunately, the dealer apparently spoke and understood little English.  It was difficult to get her to understand what we were asking or wanting.  The cocktail waitress came around frequently and kept us from getting too thirsty!  

There was some kind of construction or re-modeling going on in the back of the casino....maybe to the coffee shop...I couldn't tell.  

You sort of get the feeling that you're in a shady part of town when you're at El Cortez, but there were security guards all around and everything was fine.

Walking in you're greeting by the smell of heavily buttered popcorn and plush purple carpet. My charming date bought a medium soda and some gummy fruits for a whopping $9. Then we saw the size of the huge cup of soda given out and balked a bit, just to give you an idea of the size of a medium. He remarked ""I think this is enough for at least 5 people, maybe I've been in London too long"". The theater itself was serviceable, not much to say there.

Expensive weekday tickets, oversized portions that may give people diabetes if they manage to finish it to justify oversized prices and being extremely out of my way make this experience two thumbs down and just as many stars.

2407,1,1550188800000,"Stayed here during Christmas. We found a deal from some vacation website that included a rental car, so I can't comment on the price booking through the hotel.

This place is nice and clean, and quiet. Our room was on the 19th floor, which was a little unnerving hearing the wind whip by that high up. The hotel is older, but everyone there was so nice--from the maid to the front desk to the omelette station guy and everyone in between.

We stayed in a standard, non-smoking room that did not smell like smoke. The major complaint I have is that the shower head is way too low and would cause someone above average height to have to contort themselves in a dangerous way to perform the simple task of hair-washing, hoping they don't slip and get hurt. I might be speaking from experience.

Carpets had stains on them. But even the standard room was spacious! I did a cartwheel just because I had the room. Bed was comfortable.

Also didn't like the soap products. The air there is dry enough already, but the hand and body soap made it much worse. You're in the dessert--shouldn't you use moisturizing soap?

Another plus to staying off the strip: you don't have to battle all that ridiculous traffic. Just zip down the back road and turn when you get to the Riviera.",2

Let me start by saying that the staff was extremely friendly and nice.  But that's where it ends.

The food is very, very, very poor in quality.  I tried a small portion of about 15 dishes, and was not impressed by a single one.  I didn't expect gourmet food for $13, but the quality was very bad.  The shrimp looked and tasted old.  The rice, chicken dishes, beef dishes, etc were really bad.  The ice cream had frost on it as if it's been sitting there for 6 months.

Breakfast leaves much to be desired! A waffle is the only hot thing you can get/make. No meat. No eggs. 3 cereals to pick from. Frozen sandwiches that you have to microwave. Yogurt. Toast & bagels.  We decided to go to Chick-fil-a around the corner. 

This is a pet friendly hotel and they don't have specific rooms that they use for guest with pets so if you have a severe pet allergy I wouldn't stay here. 

Overall it's a nice hotel and we would probably stay here again",2
2441,1,1550966400000,"Full Review in Blog.

A BYOB located in a rather blue collar part of town the restaurant may seem an odd choice to the unfamiliar-everything about its location, size, and layout seems to say ""locals only."" What those paying attention would realize, however, is that Chef Douglas Dick has twice been a Beard Award Semi-Finalist, thrice been named Pittsburgh Magazine's Chef of the Year, and has been embracing the ""Farm to Table"" movement since before most had American's even heard of it.  Locally sourced foods prepared by an internationally educated chef and a menu that changes daily (because Dick goes to the market daily for his products) everything about Bona Terra sounded fantastic.

Given our large lunch and long drive ahead it was decided that we would share a couple of small appetizer plates prior to our mains - and given the fact that neither appetizer required cooking they would arrive quite quickly after our amuse.  Starting first with a cheese plate, Cypress Grove Lamb Chopper with poached Bartlett Pears, Mixed Berry Infused Honey.  Brought forth by the same company who makes my favorite cheese of all time, Humboldt Fog, the Lamb Chopper was described as a sheep's milk Gouda imported from Holland.  Smooth as butter and fragrant without being pungent the fromage was accompanied by impossibly sweet pears, water crackers, local strawberries, and a clover honey blended with what tasted largely of blackberry.  A very well composed plate and a great cheese.

Following our appetizers would be a short delay-but a delay with the most unexpected treasure of the night...a bread and butter combo that still leaves me weak in the knees.  Served singly (thank goodness or I'd have invariably eaten ten,) and piping hot from a wooden basket were ""Brioche Rolls and Salted Peach Butter.""  Warm and buttery on their own the rollswould have been suitable without any topping - but paired with a peachy sweet mélange of butter and cream cheese, they were heavenly. All told I ate four...in retrospect I still wish I would have eaten ten.

For my sister's main - Oven Roasted North Atlantic Cod over Israeli Cous Cous and Sauteed Green Beans, Tarragon Infused Butter-Wine Pan Sauce with Grilled Black Mission Figs.  Having never seen fig meets fish on a single plate I was intrigued by this dish from the start and only moreso when it arrived.  A substantial slice of mild and buttery cod over a toothsome cous-cous and pan-crispy green beans, the fish was topped with a halved plump and juicy Fig clearly soaked in wine and butter while a sweet/savory reduction of butter, wine, and chopped figs circulated the plate.  While the plating, in my opinion, could have been dressed up I'm rather certain the flavoring and quality couldn't have been improved.

While my companions' dishes were good mine was unreal - and only improved from the menu listing when Chef Dick informed us that he'd just gotten in a lobe of foie gras and if it ""met his approval"" he'd like to add it to the dish.  Arriving with the smells of cinnamon, cherry, allspice, and thyme the ""chef suggests medium rare"" Seared Maple Leaf farms Duck breast and Hudson Valley Foie Gras over long grain Basmati rice, Sauteed Zucchini, Local Sour Cherry Compote, Sweet and Spicy Tropical Jamaican Jerk Reduction was fantastic.  Smooth and supple with a clean layer of fat ribboned beneath the crispy skin the duck was potentially the best quality duck meat I've ever had.  Topped with a velvet and ample slice of foie gras a presented over a benign rice and vegetal zucchini mélange the dish was brought to a peak by the addition of poached black cherries and a reduction that added heat and spice without overwhelming the multiple nuances of the dish.

After a meal so stunning dessert was a must - For my sister's selection she targeted the Bavarian Chocolate and Hazelnut Tart with Local Strawberries.  Served in a buttery crust similar to my mothers, Erika's tart would consist of a creamy whipped dark chocolate mousse loaded with what I can only describe as ""Chunky Hazelnut Butter.""  Something like a ""dark"" Nutella pie the simplisticy of the tart was matched only by its decadence.

For my dessert the decision was between cheesecake and the dish our server described as the ""house special."" With everything exceptionally special so far I went with the obvious - a simple and decidedly indulgent Rich Chocolate Cake with Peach Ice Cream.  Served almost like Keller's Bouchon dessert the thick, rich, and warm cake was topped with a large scoop of ice-cream that tasted like a melting peach without the fuzz.  Focusing on the cake-the texture was almost that of a steamed pudding-a little wet, but ""set"" and hefty.

Bona Terra was one of those experiences that makes you realize just how good largely unmanipulated fresh fruits, vegetables, and proteins can be when placed in the hands of a skilled chef.  Great food, wonderful service, and a nice location without all the hype and frills - a ""hidden gem.""",2

This incredible collection is beautifully showcased in a beaux-arts temple and a beautiful Marcel Breuer addition which are soon to be joined with a new Rafael Vinoly expansion that will unite and reprogram both sections.

2494,2,1551139200000,"Came here a couple months ago with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. We arrived at 10:15pm and got seated immediately. The restaurant look about 60% occupied.

As we were seated our server introduced himself, a soft spoken guy, and was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave his honest opinion when making recommendations. He seemed like a nice guy but came off sounding very condescending at times. I really don't appreciate servers who stereotype their tables based on their age and attire. All we ordered were a round of water and didn't get any refills after our initial glasses! 

To be honest, most of the staff was pretty soft spoken as well. I'm not sure if it was because of the intimate/luxury feel they were trying to give but all of the team members in the restaurant were very quiet and quite honestly not very helpful either.

Anyways, we ended up ordering the Gotham and Truffle pizza which were large 16"" pies. Both of which our server had recommended as being popular choices among guests. 

The Gotham was basically a meat lovers wet dream, it was topped with pepperoni, salami, sausage, and a handful of other ingredients. Overall it wasn't bad, but tbh I can't say I fell in love with it either.

The Truffle pizza was a major disappointment. Beware when you order it, it was very oily and certainly takes a refined pallet to enjoy.

Overall, we were not very impressed by what this place had to offer. Five 50 seemed like a knockoff more expensive dining version of Secret Pizza at The Cosmopolitan and the service was not worth what we paid. It was certainly a 1 time experience.

The breakdown: (for the price)

Service: 2/5
Food Quality: 3/5
Atmosphere: 4/5

All 4 of us shared 2 large pizzas and it cost us $66. 

Tip* You'll get more bang for your buck by going to secret pizza at The Cosmopolitan.",2

It was super hot and I couldn't get in the pool though because the pool was glacial-cold!  I was surprised because it's been so hot I'm surprised the sun hasn't heated the pool to a normal-cool temperature.  I wasn't sure if I was just being crazy but my girlfriends also couldn't get in the pool.  No worries though because we sat in the cabana a bit and the misters came on and it was pretty nice.  It also was a nice time because we had an amazing bartender who kept walking over to check on us.  She had long blonde mermaid waves with some purple in it to match her bikini.  She was super nice and really did everything she could to ensure us a great time.  While I was there I had a lobster and avocado salad.  For $18 you get a dark leafy green salad with thinly-sliced avocado on top and lots of lobster- two entire claws plus it seemed!  I was pretty impressed it could be $18!  I don't think the lobster was super fresh but for $18 that was a steal!  The service really was stellar.,2

They serve turkey bacon (one of the best I've had) that is thick and flavorful. Pretty much everything that I've tried has exceeded my expectations for a gluten free meal/treat. 

Another awesome part about this place is that you can buy all the gluten free flours premixed and ready to bake with. The gluten free flour mixtures are hard enough to get right on your own. They do it for you and it's cheaper then any grocery store.

Servers were very efficient, and we never had to wait very long to give a drink order or get the drink.  Lots of different appetizers were served, finger foods that were mostly fried.  Pigs in blankets, mini crab cakes, and a host of others that were tasty.  Though I usually don't order them, I couldn't resist, since this was dinner for us. There were plenty of tables for seating.

An excellent cover band was playing, but unfortunately I never did get their name.  Good music, and the girl singer had a great voice.

2570,3,1550016000000,"My third time to this place over the years it's been open. Not overly impressed. A few tasty things on the menu but definitely overpriced for what you get. 

Rice, VERY dry with absolutely no flavor. For a Mediterranean place, you need something more than just plain white rice. 

Hummus. Also very plain tasting. For hummus being an al-la-carte item, one piece of pita bread is not cool. I mean come on, it's bread. Don't make me discover it's only enough for one person when u give me a family size portion of hummus. I forgot about this when it happened last time. Shame on me. 

The chicken and lamb were both good kabobs. My girlfriend wanted a lamb/veggie kabob combo and they charged her full price for 2 entrees. 

The spicy sauce u can serve urself is very good. Do not forget to get this!

Overall, there are better Kabob spots nearby. $32 for me and my girl to get kabobs with no drinks/dessert is crazy. I say this place is only good in a pinch.",2

The gnocchi was soft and delicious, it came with a trio of sauces, the pesto was by far my favorite. My son had the fettuccine and all but licked the bowl, and this boy's a pasta expert! The best part of the meal was the incredible tiramisu. Our server told us that the owner's dad makes it fresh every morning, and you could tell. It was creamy and so very rich and delicious.

I've had the burger and the walnut burger and both were solid (not excellent, but good). Every time I've gone it's been pretty empty and the bar feels a bit dirty (I'm a fan of dive bars but something about this one was a bit too much for me).  Maybe if it had been full I wouldn't have noticed.  While service here has been adequate some of the staff seem to have a very negative attitude towards the customers.  They are generally curt, and one time, when we came in after the kitchen had closed (but didn't realize it), we were rudely told that they were no longer serving food and would close soon.  Now, I have worked in food service so I know what it's like to have people come in when you've already shutting things down, but we were not demanding or anything.  They could have courteously let us know that the kitchen was closed and we would have been on our way.  Anyway, at this point, I generally stay away from this place but if a friend really wanted to go there, or a band was playing that I wanted to see, I would stop by.",2

As we were heading to there from Toronto downtown, we took Go Train and the Train was a little late. They did not contact us at all and cancelled our reservation. And when we arrived they did not show any apology and even a little arrogant. Well if the cancel-without-contacting-customer is your style, at least write down when people make reservation and I will call you if the train delay happend. But they did offer us another table. They had plenty vacant tables in normally busy Saturday evening (yes I totally understand if that is the service). And for food, I am a big fan of Italian food. But honestly, compared to tons of Italian restaurant in Toronto, the taste is not recommended. And if anyone is travelling Port Credit, there are many other better options to dine.

We started with the zucchini fritters. They were unique in that they had cheese inside but could have used a bit more seasoning--but nothing that the delicious aioli couldn't fix!

For my main I ordered the sweet potato tortelli. It was a dish that intrigued me from the menu and our server recommended it as well. It was good but in my opinion could have used sage to give the dish more flavor. My husband got the short ribs stew which he raved about. The cornbread that came with the stew was so good, not too dry and just enough kick from the peppers inside. 

We finished with dessert which were perfectly portioned. We split the cheesecake which was to die for and the chocolate cake that was great as well.",2

2658,1,1549670400000,"Mixed thoughts on this hotel.

The room was nice and electric black-out curtains were awesome. That was a nice luxury for the tired/drunk/lazy. 

The customer service I felt was condescending whenever I called the front desk, or one of the multiple concierges.  I booked on Expedia/Hotels.com and each time I called or spoke to the folks in the lobby, because I booked on a ""Third Party,"" they treated me like some cheap coupon guy.  Womp.  

WIFI is charged $10/day if you book for though a third party, also, I was told.  Rules are rules, but again, no need to be condescending.  HHonors members get allowed a code to get wifi, depending on who you talk to.  

The cleaning team and security were all nice-Thank you to you guys!

The parking.  Sucked.  Very difficult to find a space, with multiple cars ""parked"" waiting like hawks.  Long walk to hotel as well.  Not a good hotel if you want to drive anywhere else.

The pool/jacuzzi is beautiful, however closes at 6PM.  Yes, closes at 6PM.  So after work I was unable to swim laps, or just sit and bake in the bubbles like a fat happy bastard.

The lobby is beautiful, however, its bland and boring, even for older folks.  Waste of space.

We got the GO room floor 20, it stunk so bad like mold or who knows what, and a bucket sitting in front of the elevator for leaking water from ceiling. We called down to the desk and told them and they moved our room one floor up , with no smell. They charged us 80$ resort fee (they never did that in the past) for wifi etc. Had NO wifi connection the whole time I was there , and needed to check into my flight. Spent another hour at the desk complaining about this. Then the next day we had no air conditioning in our room. Yet more time at the desk trying to resolve another issue. The last thing I want to be doing on my vacation is complaining at the service desk. Oh and don't forget the food court was closed due to the plumbing issues and constructions going on in the casino stunk like sewage from an incident a few weeks ago. They did resolve our issues in a timely manner however , refunded our resort fees, free breakfast etc. Next time Ill be staying at the Hard Rock for the same price.

Let me first say that the service can often be brutal in a lot Chinese restaurants...noncommittal stares from wait staff, lack of patience when asking about dishes,  etc.. you know the drill.  However, my daughter Muff and I recently went to Everyday Noodles on a busy Saturday and while the line was lengthy, it moved pretty quickly thanks to the drill sergeant hostess up front.

Here's a further breakdown of the rest of the visit:

Décor - Truly appreciated the lack of faux Chinese décor.  Loved the lightness/airiness of the place.  Seating could be placed a little farther apart, but hey, it still beats 99% of the Chinese restaurants around. 

Food - 
Shrimp, Pork and Vegetable Potstickers - Well done and you could actually taste each component, but nothing overpowered anything else. Yum!

Rolled Onion Pancake w/ Sliced Beef - Never seen this dish here in Pittsburgh, but I have had it elsewhere and this one stacks up pretty well.  Double yum!

Taiwanese Style Pork Belly Slider - Okay, braised pork belly with fragrant soy/ginger/garlic goodness?  Come on, man!  How can you go wrong!  Chinese Happy Family yum! 

Dan Dan Noodles Szechuan Style - Wonderful chew to the noodles and we added a little extra stink to it by adding some garlic-chili sauce.  Great!

2770,3,1550966400000,"Green Valley Ranch is a great place to stay and is a very nice upscale resort away from the strip! It is very different staying there than any other Casino or resort on the strip. It is quiet and they have a beautiful pool! There is a real sand beach that leads into the swimming pool that kids just love. The pool is also very warm and nice. I have stayed at Green Valley Ranch several times and the other thing I love is the Spa. The use of the Spa is typically included with your room. They have a nice Sauna, and Steam Room, and Hot Tubs. But the other nice thing the Spa has is a Spa pool separate from the main pool. There is also a great Arcade and a Movie Theater as well, which makes staying at Green Valley great for families. I'm not a huge fan of their Buffet. But Pizza Rock makes the best Pizza in the world, i'm not kidding!!! I was also not overly impressed with Hanks. Hanks is a very high end Steakhouse. But for the price it wasn't that great compared to other places you can go to in Las Vegas. My Steak was pretty tough and chewy and overcooked. For a $250 meal you would expect better.  There are also a lot of nice restaurant options at the shopping district right next door. The rooms are nice, especially the bathroom with a nice Tub and separate shower. Overall it is a great, classy place to stay away from the busy strip. Sometimes we like to stay on the strip and have fun for three days, and then go stay a couple nights at Green Valley to relax!!",2
2775,1,1549584000000,"I was on may way home and was about to drive by this Panda but I decided instead to feed my cravings.

Paul rang up my order. He did an ok job. There were a couple trays empty or near empty so my choices were cut down my 2. They were not going to refill the pans because it was close to closing, the place was empty and I could tell the cooks were cleaning and wrapping up for the night.

I picked the Bigger Plate ($8.30) My 3 options were:
Broccoli Beef. Pretty good. Broccoli was fine, beef a little chewy.
String Bean Chicken. Good. The sauce had congealed a bit but it still ended up being pretty tasty.
Orange Chicken. This pan at the counter had the most so I felt it was probably the freshest. Paul put a decent helping on my plate. There were very few deep fried pieces of nothing that are common with these types of dishes. 

I also had the fried rice which was fine. 

Like Lauren M. however, I was also charged for something I didn't get. Well, to be honest, I'm not sure what it is:

CMN Hospital / Leader  $0.03

I know, it's only 3 cents but what the hell is it? If it's a donation, then ask the customer but regardless, you can't charge customers for something that they don't order or agree to. No Bueno.

It's so intimate. easy to talk to the person sitting next to you, if thats what you so desire.  Or you can immerse yourself in your own conversation.  The bar staff here was amazing for this event and worked so hard to make sure everyone was taken care of.  We loved the beer flights.  Even I am not a fan of IPA's but the IPA they served in the beer flight wasn't too bad, sure it had the bitterness at the end but a lot easier to drink than most IPA's.  My favorite had to be the Saison beer, it had just enough sweet notes to captivate me.  I do want to talk about my favorite thing though, which was our charcuterie board.  We had the brewer's reserve which I think was a perfect combination of meat and cheese.  The fig spread was amazing but I am also a sucker for fig anything  I do wish they had given a little more of the fig, as not all the beer:meat:fig ratios were balanced and thats kind of a huge pet peeve of mine.  Regrettably I didnt find where the pistachios or almonds fit in with that board but that is just my opinion.  Overall this would be a spot I would definitely come back to again.

2792,1,1550361600000,"Always a good time and has been for several decades.

I've been coming here as a child and as an adult and have always enjoyed the glitz and glamor of the World Famous Las Vegas Strip.  It's definitely the place to see and be seen. It has evolved many times from being the adult Disneyland to being more family oriented to back to being the adult Disneyland. 

The waves change every ten years and so does the profitability of the strip.

When the economy is running on all cylinders there are high occupancy levels and gaming revenues. When the economy is slow you'll find less people and more homeless people on the walkways and streets.

With the closing of several iconic hotels to make way for openings of newer and more lavish mega resorts I've come to enjoy the transitions.  Being able to pinpoint where establishments used to be and what they are now makes me feel old and nostalgic.

The Las Vegas Strip has always been the iconic place to visit when you turn 21,22,102! 

So much to see and so much to do in so little time.  

From binge drinking, boxing, buffets, concerts, fine dining, gambling shopping, to sight seeing, UFC - whatever you want to do, you can and at any time of the day or night. You can do it by foot, car, monorail or simply by sitting in your room.

Something about Las Vegas and the strip still entices me to come back and always yearning for more. I've vowed to stay in every hotel on the strip as well as downtown before I kick the bucket. I've amassed many room keys and do not disturb signs as well as a few matches. Consider it hoarding... But I want to be able to tell my grandkids that I've been here and there and this is my proof of the good times I've had in Vegas.

Whether your rich or broke attractive or ugly- it doesn't matter in Vegas. When you're here you own the world even if it's only for a weekend.

Do yourself a favor and visit more frequently! 

See you around. Cheers!",1
2792,2,1550361600000,"This is not anywhere close to authentic Italian gelato by any means, but for the price and the flavor of the gelato offered here, over the summer we pretty much made this place a regular stop after dinner. 

Apparently there used to be 64 flavors out at one time, but now there are somewhere in the 30's area and a case for cakes. Frankly, I don't care that there aren't 64 flavors to choose from at one time. That would be overwhelming. There are generally enough choices to keep everyone happy.

Flavor wise, the fruit flavors leave a lot to be desired. They are more icy than ice-creamy. So I don't tend to get those much. The pistachio and chocolate amaretto are my two favorite flavors though. I go back to them the most. I have also enjoyed butterfinger, just because I love butterfingers. Most of the other flavors are good as well.

For the sizes available the price for gelato here is also a good deal. We get smalls for $3.15 each. One of the cheaper prices we have seen among all gelato shops. And you can mix flavors in your cups. Two flavors in small and medium, and up to three flavors in the large size. 

We have had to stop coming in though just because we both gained some weight over the summer and we are both on a health kick, trying to lose the pounds. But I would come back here again eventually.",2

2800,1,1550448000000,"Nothing can top the feeling of walking into a bar after a long day and hearing a guitarist play Billy Joel's ""She's Always a Woman."" I nearly melted in my seat. Well, that was shortly before my friend needed to pop over to the bar on the other side of SLS to get a hot toddy. Then we returned to Monkey Bar.

There are a few seats at the bar, plenty of tables and couches to lounge around. It's a lovely place to relax within SLS station. I'm not sure how often they have musicians, but the guitarist made me so happy. The bartenders are friendly (some of them are kinda cute) and the drinks are on point. 

I had both the Monkey Fuzz Gimlet and the White Peach Margarita. Just enough to get me buzzed before retiring to my room after a long two-day meeting. I was a little taken aback when the bartenders didn't ask me if I wanted a second drink after I finished my first one (unusual) but it was easy to flag them down and ask.

As far as hotel bars go, this one is great. The prices are reasonable, the selection is plentiful, and the atmosphere is classy but laid-back. There's many great things about SLS Station, and I'm glad Monkey Bar turned out to be one of them.",2

If you love Korean food, you're going to like this place, but for any owners of the all you can eat concept restaurants, you can take notes on how to clear out your patrons from Woo Che.    Just seat the patrons, bring them their drinks, and leave them alone the entire visit, and don't ever check on them.     I couldn't find my waitress for a refill, and was dying for anything that looked like a liquid by the second plate.

I really don't like their square grilles, because it didn't get a even heat on it, but the bugogi was good, and  they could cut the beef brisket slightly thicker, because most of it sticks to the grill.

This post is meant for the manager of the store. I was really disappointed with how she handled our particular problem. We had purchased some shoe accessories (sole mates) these items are meant to be put on your heel so that they don't dig into the grass. We followed the instructions and put them on correctly, they fit well. However they didn't work, we sank into the grass continually and by the end of the wedding photo shoot (30 minutes) the sole mates had worked their way up our heels and had to be yanked off scraping the finishes off our shoes.

When I spoke to an associate about this she told me she would speak to a manager about it. No one ever got back to me. I followed up a few days later and spoke to a manager, I explained my situation. Instead of offering helpful solutions she instantly became defensive and told me I didn't buy the right size, I put them on wrong, and I am the one liable for my ruined shoes because I assumed the risk when I bought the sole mates. 

She told me to bring in my shoes in so she could look at them. When I asked if we would be reimbursed she snarled and said refunds were against store policy. 

I've been in the service industry for over 2 decades. I've never seen a manager deal with a situation in such a rude and unhelpful way. I will definitely be sending my brides-to-be elsewhere.",2

I was there about 9pm on a Friday night, and the staff could not have been nicer.  Before deciding, I tasted several flavors and they heaped several more upon me.  ""If you like that, then you'll like this...""  I must have collected almost ten of those multi-color mini gelato putty knives that they use as tasting utensils.  I finally chose two flavors:  the peanut butter oreo and the mud pie.  The peanut butter oreo had a rich peanut buttery taste and a smooth, creamy texture.  It was outstanding.  The mud pie was a combination of a few different flavors.  It was a little firmer and left the after taste of bad coffee.

Meanwhile the water was all warmed up and I stuck my feet in and felt the wonderful jets! It felt amazing! Once Dyanna got there they started our pedi's and they even worked in Dyanna's other friend.

Since I was going on a 2week vacation I simply said, I need a good job done since I had never had him before. So after polish removal, he starts cutting the heck out of my cuticles and I pulled my hand back and said, please very little cuticle cutting.  He pulled my hand back toward him and said loudly moving his face in my face, ""you want a good job?""  WTHell Dude!!! I was so shocked. I'm sorry for Jason that he hasn't met his career goals and is doing nails but since when in North America do I have to have my cuticles cut when I don't want to????

To start, I'll never understand why it always takes 3.5 hours to groom my 18-pound dog. And last time, he came home in an itching frenzy. He finally stopped after a whole month. The vet told us that something irritated his skin, but we don't know what...could've been the shampoo or maybe a powder of some sort? In addition to that, inconsistency seems to be an issue. It would be nice if the staff would take note of what their clients ask for, so that they can ensure the grooming will be the same each time. Also noticed some blood on my pup's nails a few times... they clearly cut too close to the blood supply. When I calmly brought it up, the person totally downplayed it and didn't apologize. Listen, it happens. It's not easy cutting a dog's nails, but for the love of God, a simple apology goes a long way.",2

I did have the fortune to meet one of the owners, and she's definitely a wine enthusiast, and possibly a botox enthusiast as well. 

We got a seat right by the window, and a nice sweet lady came to take care of us. She was easily one of the best waitresses I've had: super attentive, sweet, patient, and anticipated our needs before we even opened our mouth to ask. Very lovely and very intelligent. I got the foie gras appetizer which was nothing short of amazing, both in flavor and presentation. The crab salad was very fresh, light and very refreshing on a hot summer day. I got the duck entree, and that was cooked perfectly and flavored just right. Last but not least, the chocolate lava cake was so pretty, and tasted even better.

I had the fish fry off the menu and the bf had the Friday night fish fry special which featured three different types of fish.

3067,2,1550793600000,"One of the largest restaurants in Chinatown, the Regency Palace is a great place to go for dim sum, lunch or dinner anytime.... providing that you do NOT go to the buffet and order a la carte.  If you do go to the buffet, the food will be 2 1/2 to 3 star at best, and compares with most chinese buffets at any other place though with a pretty decent dessert buffet as well.
Being the largest, I never have problems finding a table for dim sum, and throughly enjoy the food.  Broken into 3 parts, 1 fixed station for the most popular steamed items, 1 fixed station for the most popular fried items, and the traditional mobile carts comprising the 3rd part, dim sum is efficient, fast and fresh.  
In groups of 6 or more, their set menu dinners are fantastic.  At a value of 20-30 a person, a group can have a feast of 7-10 dishes, all freshly made to delight friends and all.  
One special note, it's probably the best chinese place in Calgary that can accomodate private groups from as few as 10 to as many as hundreds.  Plenty of small private rooms and even a dance floor with a stage for a live band.",2

We walked up to the counter to order.  No one greeted us.  There were 5 employees standing in front of us.  One was making two burritos for himself it seems like.  They were just chatting to each other.  The guy who made our food had his hands all over counters and on his apron and pockets.  Didn't wash his hands by the way before making our food. 
 The food....brown rice was served raw, not cooked al dente... not even close.  Meat were dried and lack of seasoning.  Same goes to their expensive guacamole.  Everything was super bland the last time we came here.  

FYI, they're charging the 3 tacos differently now.  We always order 3 tacos, 2 carnitas and 1 steak with guacamole.  They charged use individually for the tacos with individual guacamole charges of .75 cents... $1.95 is the regular charge with your meal, now it's $2.25 because they charged me like this.  We eat Chipotle often, I remember guacamole around $1.25 or so.  This is ridiculous.  They should tell people to get it in the container, it's $1.95.  They should have only charged us for the $1.95 as a one time courtesy since I said something.  They're too cheap to make a regular customer happy. 

We still came here after the e. coli breakout.  That must say something, but after seeing how dirty it is here.  I don't know anymore.  I don't want to get sick.  The condiment bar is dirty and empty napkin holders and lids.  Trash cans are overflowing.

3107,3,1549584000000,"So in March (30th) of this year we had Maricopa AC come service 3 AC units (2 personal and a rental property).  The owner Steve did the service.  My personal unit was shot but I had a home warranty (which was a whole different nightmare).  The other 2 Steve said were in great shape.  Fast forward to 9/26 when our renter texted her air wasn't working.  We called Maricopa again as they would be most familiar since they had looked at it exactly 6 months prior.  This time another guy came out, Brian.  He looked at it, charged us $500 for a capacitor and relay (those parts are about $50 on Amazon.com and take less than 15 mins to install), $500 for a can of stop leak (again $50 online) as he said the coils were corroded and had holes in them, and $300 for 5 lbs of R22 (this is actually in range seeing as how the EPA requires a license to put freon in).  We said why does this AC unit have a leaking coil it was installed new in 6/2012?  He said it wasn't serviced well and cleaned.  We said we just had that done in March.  He said most guys don't do a good job of inspecting that is why, you should purchase our service package for $1700 for 5 yrs.  We said YOUR company did service it in March, Steve the owner did it.  His excuse then was Steve is too busy to do a thorough job.  I am not disputing this could have gone bad anyway but Steve could have warned us in March had he actually looked at it apparently.  Well after this $1300 repair to fix it....I should more say band aid it as it stopped working again on 9/30 less than 5 days later.  We called them again.  Brian came out and put another stop leak in it and more freon saying it probably will not work the coil is shot... it didn't, 10/6 it was done again.  We called asked what a replacement coil would cost (seeing them online for $300-500) and hoping they would give us a break since their $1300 repair did squat for us.  They said they would get us a price on it but acted as though a coil would be more than a new unit.  10/7 no call back with pricing.  10/10 we decided just to get a new unit as our renter was in 90+ degree place complaining as she should, so we called for price on that hoping again to get a break....no break, no call back even.   Thanks Maricopa Air Conditioning & Heating for charging us $1300 for 10 days of cool air, phenomenal prices lol.  I'm sure they would respond that the 2nd time they didn't charge us, but when you charge 10x what the parts cost (and considering they were up there no more than 1.5-2 hrs total, no labor is not $400 an hr) you shouldn't charge to come back; and you should have offered us $800-1000 off a new unit.  Worst part was when we called Steve for a price on a coil noticeably upset...he acted as though we shouldn't be mad we just wasted $1300?!?!",2

Came here to get a quote on two temp tires and an alignment. An older, short man tried to quote me 45, for a used tire and tried to school me on the difference between balancing/aligning tires. Never asked him what the difference was, and I know very well you can get used tires at these shops for 25-35, depending on the size and brand. 

Quickly became annoyed with the lil fella and had no choice but to school him back on what I know and had to whip out my bargaining skills. (Totally hate it!) Then, another guy shows up, tall guy, who appeared to have more authority (assuming the owner) and cut me a deal. Which to be honest, $40 for a used tire and $40 for an alignment is not much of a deal. Average price to pay at a llantera. 

The service was, bleh. They have absolutely no customer service skills and make no attempt to leave a good impression for customers to return. They want your money, they do their job and have a nice day!

3124,1,1551052800000,"South Point is just so far from everything else on the strip, why go here?

You end up seeing all the great points about this place.

- Lots of unnecessary space throughout the casino and hotel room, you feel like you can move around freely.
- A good mix of food places, although there are pretty much generic themes of ethnic foods, I found it good to have alot of options.
- Smoke smell on the casino floor was not as heavy compared to places on the strip, I think this goes with the unnecessary ceiling space which I can't complain about.
- Free Shuttle to and from the airport, it is first-come first-serve, but both trips to and from weren't full.

I guess the only bad point was again the distance from the strip, if you don't use any of the strip shuttle, it's about $30 to Caesars Palace one way.

It'll be hard to come back for a Vegas trip here, but for a convention, not a bad place to stay. Plus the room prices are very reasonable.",2

The steak comes with one bite (literally) of cornbread that melts in your mouth, making you crave more.  For dessert we had the beignets and chocolate chip cookie.  I used to think beignets were just fancy donuts but stripsteak proved me wrong.  They were crispy on the outside and chewy but airy on the inside.  It came with a trio of sauces of which creme brûlée was my favorite.  The butterscotch was too bitter with an alcoholic after taste.  Definitely will come back next time i am in Vegas.

In hindsight I should have asked for a cup of sauce on the side to dip it in. I do like them sloppy so that might have made the difference. Our other diners had a 16 inch pizza that was perfectly cooked and very good so the place can do it but apparently not every time. The deserts were fabulous so be sure to look at that menu.

Slicked back hair waiters twirl platters of Oysters and Mignonette, followed by Grilled Shrimp daydreaming on Gruyere Polenta. Carafes of high grade Mimosas magically refill themselves. Now Chilled Shrimp dance the Cancan around eggs and prime rib as they push perfectly Carmalized Crème Brulees closer and closer to tempt you. 

Georges Brasserie truly is brunch Fantasia! Tout est merveilleux!!!",2

The entire staff is highly professional, very friendly, courteous and highly recommended. The office is spotlessly clean and gorgeous. Unhappy with the appearance of my smile after 55 years, I went in for a cleaning and to discuss crowns or Veneers. They suggested that I start with tooth whitening and possibly replacing old stained fillings in front. The results are absolutely amazing. Thank you to the entire staff for making my visit an awesome experience.",3
3211,3,1549324800000,"My second visit here WOWed me. I came here for Mothers Day - 5:30 pm - made reservations day before and they squeezed us in. Lady over the phone was accommodating. 

I don't know why but the second experience here was soooo much better. 

The sashimi is still fresh and good. So are the handrolls. I super love their california hand rolls and I don't usually get hand rolls.

Their hot items are all great. Except the garlic sirloin, this time it was chewy and slightly over cooked. But wow, item after item, (we ordered about 1/2 of the items on the grill / hot items list) and it was consistently deliciousness after  deliciousness! 

Service is fast at the beginning and slow near the end. Go figure. This is typical though so order more in your first round! 

Don't forget the assortment of dessert! Get one of each! You can do it! 

I also found out their AYCE is a couple bucks cheaper than some competitors in the area. That works for me! I'm a new fan. (minus salmon Belly and all... :)",2

I arrived about half an hour early to my appointment and the hygienist was ready for me within five minutes.  My hygienist was very friendly and did a great job cleaning my teeth.  Dr. Standley came in to check my x-rays and teeth, mentioned a few problem spots but nothing like the ""critical gum issues"" and the need for my wisdom teeth to come out like I had experienced at another dentist.

So after the $ I spent with Daisy Fresh, I still had to find someone that could hydro-flush my gray tanks using the most modern methods of going up through the drain tubes. He flushed my black tank by going through the toliet, and after he did this I had problems with my toilet seal leaking.  Because of this I cannot recommend his services.",2

3264,2,1549670400000,"I hosted my birthday event here a few weeks ago, and had an absolutely fantastic time! I came with a group of about 20 people and booked about a month in advance, which I would highly recommend doing, because spots fill up fast. All the staff here are super professional and adept at handling events with large groups and ensuring everyone has fun. For most of the people in my group, it was our first time throwing axes, so the staff gave us tips and pointers and also gave us ample time to practice before starting the ""friendly competition."" Once you've booked the place, you don't even have to worry about anything else. They arrange everything for you, and pair people up randomly for the competition, so you don't even have to worry about a thing, and everyone gets a chance to play like 4 rounds during the round robin part. For some reason they left my friend's name off the list and didn't realize until it came time for her to pay - but they were super nice about the mistake and still let her play like 4 rounds in a row, so she got her money's worth. Paying was also a very smooth process considering the large group.

The staff there really try to make the experience fun for everyone and don't openly judge you, even if you suck like me. They always try to be encouraging, and will celebrate with you when you get a really good throw in. Overall a really cool, chill group of people, but at the same time they know how to do their job and make sure everyone is having a safe time.

Even though I was embarrassingly awful at the actual axe throwing, I still had a ton of fun and would love to come back again! It's an awesome, low-key, stress-relieving activity, and will make you feel super badass :D They have great facilities, so you can bring your own food and drinks, and your party area comes equipped with a fridge and counter. Would highly recommend for any large events, birthday parties, corporate events, etc.!",2

Definitely going back to try the other two rooms as well as future rooms!",2
3268,1,1549670400000,"I give them credit for striking out on their own. Hey, at least it's not another Food Fight restaurant and Big T Miller has nothing to do with it. 

Ingredients are top notch. I really like the chef's story (self made man from a diverse background) and the food was delicious. 

Menu is quite small, which is fine, but wow, portions are tiny. I'm ok w tiny portions and big prices if the food is going to blow my mind and satiate me because it's so tasty. Graft is not there. 

As others have said, lower prices or larger portions and I'm there. Look, I'm not asking for sloppy, gross, unrefined Great Dane portions, I'm just asking to leave relatively satiated (not ""full"") after dropping a C note+ for two. 

Drinks are really good, but again, I don't care how good drinks are this isn't NYC so let's take things down just a notch. Keep Wisconsin great with cheap booze. 

Lastly, I get we're all eco and green but NO ONE likes to look at their date under LED spotlights at the bar. NO ONE. 

Service was ok. It's a new place so I'll give them some slack. 

Some plates are there, but overall it's another new Madison restaurant that fills the desires of the nouveau riche looking to spend 'big city' money in a town where the food scene mostly hasn't risen to those levels (yet, hopefully).",2

I took my dog here for a checkup and dropped him off, and they told me they would call me when they did his physical. 

They called me and told me that the vet wanted him to get blood work and give him a pancreatitis test and made it sound like something was very wrong with my dog so I agreed to the tests, but when I went to go pick up my dog they told me his physical had been fine and refused to tell me why they thought those tests were necessary. 

The staff and the vet who works there ( I believe the vet's name is Kim) were very rude and it was obvious that they had just taken advantage of me moneywise and could care less about my dog or myself.

I argued with them for an hour about this and they finally refunded my money for the tests, but not before commenting that they just wanted to make it clear that I would never bring my dog back there again. I have never been treated so rudely in my life.

It is only a couple of steps to the famous State Street of UW Madison and there is always something going on there too. It is also pretty much across the street from UW campus. The apartment itself is kept in relatively good repair compared to many of the places that I've seen directly off-campus.

We had the prime rib, my wife had the California cut and we both had the lawrys cut. It's just enough.  I could easily have eaten the diamond jim cut but didn't want to make a pig of myself. My only complaint is my wife asked for an end piece and was just told no, we don't have any. I can't believe in all the carts they couldn't come up with an end for her.   She doesn't like red meat so it was a little disappointing they didn't offer to get her an end or a better cooked piece. It was late, our reservation was for 8 and the place was nearly empty. We had a side of mushrooms ($11) that easily fed all three of us with some left over. The Yorkshire pudding was great as always. Creamed cord side is additional but my son and I both got it and it was phenomenal. Mashed comes
standard with gravy and was creamy good. For desert I had the fudge Sunday, my wife had the sticky toffee and my son had sherbet. All were good.  Add in a bottle of wine and the total price was over 300 but well worth it. Great meal, good service and relaxed atmosphere.",2

I've only come here during the day so I don't really know how it is at night. But I can say that the food here is legit Thai food for an astounding price. The Panang curry is probably the best thing on the menu and their sticky rice is always super fresh and just right. 

The lady that's always taking orders and is always very nice and easy to speak with. 
The chef is super speedy and always gets the food out hot fresh and tasty. The Thai teas here are something to just come here for alone. 

Other places load their Thai teas up with so much added sweetness you will taste more of the tea here than at other places. I would highly recommend this place especially if you've ever been to Thailand and want some real Thai food!",2

Chicken fingers - one not cooked all the wayand the rest mush. The soup was beef vegetable.  Something from out of a can.   Sub sandwich - vinegar completely soaked through bread and mushy.  I almost cannot believe that they serve food like this.   I would attribute a lot of this to the fact that I ordered it at 6:35 and it arrived at my house at 7:45.  The way it tastes - it sat for at least 45 minutes getting cold and mushy.   I will never order from this restaurant again and I suggest that you don't either.  With this economy, one would think that places that want to stay in business would go the extra distance to make sure their food is better.   By the way, sandwich, soup, 5 chicken strips and sampler appetizer $$43 with the $5 tip that I wish I hadn't had given now.  I feel completely ripped off and still hungry....

3380,1,1550361600000,"My review of Cashman is for the fantastic experience that my wife and I had during our recent visit to the Bellagio out in Las Vegas. We were visiting for our five year anniversary, and the Cashman Professional team at the Bellagio gave us a truly exceptional experience that was unmatched from start to finish.

My wife decided when we arrived that she wanted to get pictures taken during our visit, and our concierge set us up with a Friday night slot after 9:30. When we arrived in the lobby, our photographer Julie was already waiting in the lobby with all of her professional equipment. As we went to take pictures in an around the Bellagio (near the fountains, in the atrium with flowers, main lobby with stained glass, etc.) Julie gave us professional posing tips, stopped many people attempting to walk through or setup in our shots, and overall, just gave my wife a calming influence while getting our photos taken. Julie's talent and vision were then exemplified in our photos which we were able to see proofs of two days later.

We sat down with Alis (pronounced Alice) at the studio where she was engaging my wife and put together a beautiful menagerie of shots on video, a book of some of our better photos, and a few 8 x 10's that really stood out. Alis was very patient and recommended different finishing on photos that we planned to purchase. Her ability to understand and quickly evaluate what we wanted made our purchasing decision very easy and we look forward to seeing our results captured for the future.

Cashman Photography at the Bellagio was hands down one of the best experiences during our trip to Las Vegas. Their staff is exceptional at relating to and working with customers, and we highly recommend them if you're thinking about professional portraits while you're in Vegas. If possible, ask for Julie as your photographer, as her eye for beauty and capturing amazing shots is 2nd to none. 

We're certainly glad we had them done, as our memories will last a lifetime.",1

The overhaul was pretty extensive but the place was still recognizable from the previous Minder Binders which was really nice for the nostalgia. The food menu didn't look great & I mistakenly ordered a foo foo chick drink which I rarely do (a pina colada) that was so, so lacking on the frozen end it was border line warm from over blending. Also it was Tempe priced in a shallow margarita glass. Hook me up with a hurricane glass full of frozen goodness & that's a Pina Colada. What I got was just sad. 
Hubs got a beer which was cold & what he ordered. Next time I will do the same. 
At the old Minder Binders I would have only dreamed of getting a beer. I should have stuck to that thought process  but with the fancy bathrooms & extensive overhaul I thought hey let's be fancy.

Can't get over how nice the delivery man was. Best service I've ever had. And the margarita pizza was beautiful just as he said. We're definitely making this our new Sunday pizza place! Thanks so much!!,2

3444,3,1550448000000,"I love a good hot dog and we were excited to try this place out after hearing great things. We drove by one night with family and it turned out to be just a small inside counter with only about 2 seats. They do have a picnic table outside for nice weather days. We decided to come back a few weeks later and planned for take out this time.  I ordered the regular hot dog and they have a wide variety of free toppings including ketchup, mustard, onions and pickles that I went for.  My fiancé ordered 2 of the specialty dogs, one with mac and cheese with bacon the other with spicy peppers and sauce.  We loved them all and the dogs are served on large fresh buns and they split the dog lenghtwise to get the toppings inside-yum.   For $2.50 extra you can get an order of fries and drink.  I ordered 2 sides instead and got the mac and cheese which was amazing and I highly recommend. I also got the potato salad which was not so great-basically frozen hash browns in mayonnaise.  Regardless it is still worth stopping by when in the area.",2

Service has always been ok, nothing memorable.  The Scottsdale location is full of a certain type of crowd I cannot stand, and every time I visit I remember why I rarely go here.  The beer is okay.  I think SanTan brewery is far better, and as breweries go across the US it's nothing memorable.

We sampled the chilaquiles, bean and cheese pupusas, a baleada, scrambled eggs off the kids menu (super cheap!) and a vanilla concha. The concha hit it out of the ballpark. I used to live 5 min from US Mexico border and this concha was orgasmically good!  The pastry was plush, fresh and delicious! The chilaquiles were unique, as they are served with feta, which is not typical, but makes sense as an alternative to queso cotija.  The pupusas were enormous and simply well done; the curtido was fantastic. I'm so happy that this place opened up. It's great for brunch, as it's menu is more breakfast/brunch/lunch.  Great cafe, I hope it stays open because I'm addicted!",2
3473,2,1549756800000,"Cute bakery/eatery in beautiful old Montreal. Opt for the pastries instead of the savoury meal options. I tried the almond croissant $3.75 which was highly recommended but it was just ok in terms of a croissant. I loved the elixir ice tea, it's a green tea with ginger, lemon and pomegranate. It was the most delicious ice tea I've ever had  - complex yet balanced flavours and just a touch of sweetness. Only sad part is that the very small glass is $4.  

I didn't love the egg on your face $11.95 - Spicy poached eggs with herbs and mayonnaise, Comté cheese, speck, and slow roasted tomatoes. The panini was just too heavy with the mayo and cheese for a breakfast item (for me at least) and the sriachha just over powered the eggs. 

I really wanted to like this place as it was so highly recommended but it didn't do it for me. Loved the ice tea and would return for that.",3

Today I requested tea but a not too sweet variety and tried a chai spiced latte, which was delightful. Muffins and cookies are baked in house.

3481,2,1550361600000,"3.5 stars- definitely better than 3 stars, but not quite 4.

This restaurant is location in the middle of Crystals on the Strip.  From the outside looking in, the restaurant is inside a neat sculptured ""treehouse"". It sort of made me feel like if would be cool to eat in there, but sitting on the inside of the treehouse looking out I feel a little disappointed, because I felt like I was eating in an ""upscale"" food court with views of retail stores, such as  LV, Jimmy Choo, and Zegna.  Not exactly, the scene I expected  from an expensive restaurant, however on the other side there was a piano bar.

However, service was impeccable, except we were only told the beef carpaccio was out when we ordering rather than beforehand.  In a rush we picked tuna tartare as our appetizer, husband ordered mac & cheese, we shared the chopped salad,  king crab legs and sea bass.  

We ordered a bottle of Schramberg Blanc de Blanc for $70. Given it is about $27 in retail that markup isn't terrible, beside by the glass ranged from $15 to $30. The wine list is comprehensive.

I am kind of bored with tuna tartare, but it was definitely above average and the portion size of the appetizer is the size of a meal.  It is presented like a tower with the base made of crushed fried wontons, then avocado almost like guacamole, then the seasoned tuna.  

The mac & cheese was a huge portion that could feed 4 people on its own or 6 side servings.  I just had to have a bite, it was creamy, cheesy and tangy all the same time; I like the addition of gorgonzola, which still remained subtle.   Definitely an adult upscale mac & cheese. 

Chopped salad was solid and I like how we were told the ingredients and asked if we wanted to omit anything.

The King Crab comes warm when it is an entree and that was a bit unexpected, but tasted sweet and drowned in the drawn butter....ooooh, so good. I was surprised how meaty the 1 lb of legs were...easily filling up one person.  

I love Chilean Sea Bass prepared any way, but I it was pan-fried to perfection.  The outside crusty and the inside soft and buttery. the seasoning was just salt.  The serving size is probably 8 oz, which is ample and justifies the price.

No room for dessert, but a slice of  chocolate layer cake with schlag (whipped cream) was on the house since it was my birthday.  Very generous.

Overall, pretty good, but again I couldn't get past the view which cheapened the ambiance. We left with enough food for another dinner so that was good too.

Don't know why it is called ""beach club"".  The environment doesn't in any way demonstrate a ""beach club"".  That may be a good thing, though.

Will I go again? Probably not, I think Joe's Seafood (NOT the Crab Shack) has a better ambiance and food, except the fish here is better.",2
3493,3,1550620800000,"My family has been buying cars from these guys for years. We have purchased well over a dozen and have no plans to stop any time soon. We get 90% of our service done at this location on our cars.

We get great service every time. Once my dad had his car detailed and the tires were not up to his expectations so Toyota sent a Tech TO OUR HOUSE after hours to clean them himself in our driveway. Whhhhaaat? That is so unheard of anywhere else. I live in Chapel Hill now and had my car serviced ONCE up there and will never go back. This is my home service center and will remain so.

I'm sorry that the other yelper had a bad experience and I hope that they reported it to the service manager.

Oh and ask for Mark, he's a great sales guy! He has been taking care of us for at least a decade and a half? Maybe more?",2
3498,2,1550361600000,"I'll just start by saying 18 has very fresh fish.  

THAT SAID....WHY do they cover this gorgeous fish with gloopy mayo and sugary syrupy sauces?  Let the fish stand on it's own!  Next time we eat there I will say hold the sauces.  The tuna is fresh and tasty and the taste doesn't need to be masked with gloopy gloop and fried rice krispie bits.  There are too many fried rolls on the menu!

TRUST in your FISH, 18!  It stands on it's own!

The spicy tuna is GREAT and the wine list is VERY good.  Trefethen chardonnay...and I think there was a bottle of Gary Farrell at one point.  WELL done on your wine choices.  (I think 1/2 prices on Tues? - not sure - check with 18.) 

18 would be a top choice if they would lighten up on the sauces and fried bits...(and I'd love to see real crab instead of crab sticks) but until then, we'll head there more because it's close, but not because it's great.  

PS - husband loved the chicken & broccoli w/ brown rice + crayons for baby are a +!!",2
3499,1,1550534400000,"I would definitely not return to this restaurant.  We ate here for a work day lunch recently and regretted our choice.  

I had the hibachi shrimp, and my husband had the hibachi chicken.  Neither of us liked our food.  The hibachi flavor just wasn't good.  Additionally, all of our food smelled and tasted like it had been cooked on a grill with oil that was old.  Like if you were to stir fry some food and then stir fry again in the same oil another 50 times.  It simply did not taste good or fresh at all.  

With regard to the shrimp sauce, it tasted fine.  However, it was room temperature, leading me to believe it had been sitting out for some time.  If it had been either hot or cold I would have felt better about it!

And another note on temperature:  the day of our visit was an unusually warm December day, and the temperature in the restaurant was so hot and muggy that we were totally sweaty by the time we left.....not a good way to return to the office for the afternoon.  Yes, it was an unusually warm day.  But it did not appear that the restaurant had turned any air on at all.  

We arrived early - around 11:45, and only had to wait about 5 minutes for our food.  By 12:15, however, the line snaked through the entire restaurant, and we saw several patrons who had been waiting at least 15 minutes for their food.  Given the long line, it makes me wonder if most people like their food more than I do.  I'm more inclined to think it's simply because there are many businesses in that area contributing to the lunch crowds, and not enough restaurants......every restaurant in the area seems to be packed at lunch hour.

We didn't order appetizers or being drinks (it's Byob) but nonetheless had nice experience. Service was great. Food was just fine. I order a shrimp kabob plate. It came with rice and some pickled veggies. The shrimp was nicely cooked and seasoned but really nothing too special. There was a sauce that looked carefully put together but tasted like a light cocktail sauce which was weird. The rice was rice. The pickled veggies didn't seam to go with the rest of the plate but were good. My brother got basically the same plate but with chicken and some sort of white sauce instead of the cocktail sauce mimic. 
We spent 40 bucks including a 25% tip (me and my brother are in theater so we always tip well because so many waiters are also artists of some type) so it is a very decently priced place but I was a bit disappointed. My parents had been several times before and loved it so I expected something better than ok.

People complain about the amount of time it takes.  Granted it did take an hour and a half for a cut and conditioning treatment BUT not only do I love being in the salon, it's so relaxing and is all me time, AND I really don't mind them taking their time and learning.

3543,1,1549670400000,Brought my son to the splashpad on a whim. This place is filthy. The bathrooms are disgusting and the whole area smells like a trash can full of old hot dogs. If the place were cleaned occasionally I would likely give it 4 stars.,1
3543,2,1551052800000,"TL;DR - Rent somewhere else if you don't want management/maintenance barge in your home every so often or have nowhere to park, or do not like seeing dog poop everywhere, or hate having trains passing by every 15 min

I liked the property, but hated the location, management, maintenance, etc.
First thing first, the apartments are really nice, roomy, and cozy-feeling. If it were at any other location managed by someone else, I would pay double the rent to live there.
Now, the horrible experiences. I have never lived anywhere where the management/maintenance need to get into your apartment so much. Almost every month, there's some sort of inspection, replacement, remodeling that they needed to do so they need to come in, and this is especially inconvenient if you have pets. Once they came in to remodel the apartment to make it more energy efficient so electric cost less. After they did the whole thing, our next electric bill was about $40 more expensive than previous ones and stayed that way.. They are also very poor at handling scheduling things. They needed to fill some holes in the drive way, but for almost a year, and an entire summer break, they didn't do anything about it. Until the fall semester started, they told everyone that they would be shutting off parking lots to redo the roads, which worsens the already horrible parking situation. They also often shuts certain parking spaces down for repainting, etc during school session instead of breaks when most people are gone.
Speaking of parking, the parking situation is horrifying. Each building complex houses at least 6 people, while only 4 parking spaces in front of each building, which creates a space shortage. What made it worse was people kept inviting there parents/friends over and park at resident parking, and the management kept telling us that they would tow those cars but never did. Some days we couldn't find parking at all near our building. 
Now onto the trains. They trains go through about every 15 minutes and they honk very loudly, which is required by law. The walls are so thin, that you'd have to pause and wait for the trains to pass if you're watching tv, listening to a lecture, having a conversation, etc. and you'd have to do this a few times every hour. And if you're ever so unlucky to be walking outside when the trains pass by, R.I.P., your ears. I had no problem sleeping through the trains, but if you're a light sleeper, rent somewhere else cuz the trains don't stop at night.
People walk their dogs outside, the dogs poop outside, people don't pick them up, which is not news. Management kept sending out emails telling people that they were going to take actions if they didn't pick up the poop, but they never did anything. There're dog droppings everywhere.
We had a flea problem in the apartment when we first moved in because they apparently didn't clean after the previous renter moved out. The entire place smelled like wet dog for months after we moved in. We contacted the management several times to report the flea problem but nobody did anything, so we had to take it into our own hands. Several months later, they checked in to see if there still were a flea problem, and that was it.
After we moved out, they charged us a couch replacement fee, which we expected because our cat scratched the thing pretty bad. However, the fee charged was $520 total for a really cheaply made couch. If it weren't for the cat, we'd still be charged for it because the leather on the couch chipped off just from people regularly sitting on it - That's how cheaply made the couch was, and totally not worth $520. We bought a couch 2 months ago for $180 at IKEA and it's 10 times better than that piece of junk that they provided. Also, when we leased with the cats, we paid a $500 ""pet fee"". It was never stated what the fee was for, so we just assumed that it was pet deposit that would be used to cover damage caused by the pets. We contacted them when we received the couch replacement charges and they said the pet fee is not a deposit and is not used for replacement charges.

Edit 8/16/17: Almost forgot about their internet - SO SLOW. We got our own internet service less than a month after we moved in. Totally forgot that they provided internet when I wrote this review",2
3546,3,1551312000000,"I remember when Beavertails were almost exclusively in Ottawa and select events. I'm so glad Beavertails are now more easily accessible now throughout Ontario (maybe Canada?). In any case I got the classic Beavertail with butter and cinnamon. It was really fresh and crispy (deep fried right in front of me). Perfect for any season and time of day. The classic Beavertail is 390 calories (if I remember correctly), and I am surprised it is that low to be honest. 

They also have a nice selection of gelato, as well as soft serve ice cream and poutine. 
The raspberry gelato is perfectly tangy and sweet.

That includes jacket sleeve shortening, pant hemming, and having the waist taken in on the pants from a 30 to about a 29/28. No judgement was cast for paying more than the suits worth for adjustments and it was done on time exactly as we agreed on, and on time to meet my deadline. As a general tip, before you goto a tailor, do some research and decide ahead of time on the extent of the adjustments you want and be sure to communicate that to the tailor instead of taking their suggestions as gospel. I ended up with a jacket sleeve that had no dress shirt showing, too long in my opinion. I'm not sure how that happened since they measured it right on me and I agreed to where they pinned it. I didn't complain because I had to catch a flight the following morning. In the end, I think it was my fault for not communicating that I wanted a half-inch of dress shirt showing, but I thought that was universally agreed on so i just assumed his suggestion was right.

3551,3,1551052800000,"So... As im sure you have all realized by this point... This is the DMV. With that being said, you should expect to wait. 

The good news is, waiting here is comfortable. I came two days in a row Friday at 4:15PM and Saturday at 8:30AM. 

My Friday Visit: I came to get information on registering my out of state vehicle and getting a NV license. I waited in like approx 15-20mins. I walked up to my attendant with a smile & she returned the courtesy. She gave me most of the info I needed & I was on my way. I was really impressed with how quickly I was in and out. 

My Saturday Visit: I needed a smog check (done directly across the street for $20, took less than 5mins) and an on site inspection (took 2mins) so i didn't actually get in line until about 8:30AM. The line was wrapped around the building. I was intimidated but it literally only took 30mins to get to the front. I approached the attendant with a smile and again she returned the courtesy. I told her what I was there for & confirmed that I had all the correct documents. The only difference in info was that she informed me that I would have to pay my former states late reg. fees, whereas the first attendant said I would not. That wasn't a big deal for me... So I gave her my cell number went to wait. 

What I really liked about this place is the fact that they have a 7/11 style snack bar! And they text you updates on where you are in line so you can leave and come back if you'd like. Another thing Im noticing, theres ample seating and no kids running around (either visit) and this AM the bathrooms were clean. The total process has taken about 1.5hours until this point and I should be out of here in 10-15more minutes. Very doable, especially for the DMV.",2

Overcooked meat with way to little sauce and cheese. It was not something I'd want to eat again. The side of spaghetti was sauced the blah tomato sauce that lacked character and meat. The Caesar salad was edible, especially with anchovies (an extra charge), but wasn't great. My wife's eggplant dish was better than the rest of our food. The friends we went with seemed to enjoy their main courses, but they weren't wild about the stromboli they shared as an appetizer. Quite simply the best thing about the evening was the great conversation, and we were thankful that nobody was pushing us out of our booth. In fact, the wait staff were quite friendly, which was the second best part of the meal. Would we go back. Sure, but not with great gusto.

I did an online order, clearly spelled out with what I wanted. Salad and smoothie. I sent my receptionist to pick up and she came back with a smoothie only and it was the wrong smoothie. I called in and let them know. The guy Billy that picked up was to say the least an idiot. He had no idea how to handle it and blamed it on me and the online order. I was charged twice for this and got nothing that I actually ordered and no food. So I paid $32 for a smoothie that tasted like crap. It was made poorly and had to be thrown out. It was that badly prepared. When I called back in the other guy was rude and had no idea how to seal with it and said a manager would have to call me after 3:00 because they did not know how to refund or do anything for that matter. I normally go to this location during the summer for breakfast and I can honestly say you have list my business over this. I will never go this Tropical smoothie again.

3613,3,1548979200000,"Went here with the office for our annual party and I expected decent food. We went with the party menu which was set with shared apps and a choice of 4 different mains. 

From the time we sat down, our server at the bar appeared frazzled and took forever to get drinks set,made and served.  I tried the Italian Greyhound for my first drink, not only did it take 30 minutes to get to me, it came with 4 extra fruit flies on it.

I twitted about it and was asked to DM so that they could speak to the management about it.

After about an hour or so of waiting for all of our coworkers to get there, we then headed downstairs into the private room which I have to say have one of the coolest decor/ambiance I have been in.

They started to serve the Palenta fries which was shared between everyone.  It was alright, bland and the marinara dip tasted like something you could get from Loblaws.

The second starter they served was the pizza.  The crust was good, but if you eat the pizza with the toppings you will be met with the saltiest things ever.  So... needless to stay, I just ate the crust.

The third starter was a platter of mini meatballs, tiger shrimps and the risotto balls which was basically an upscale cafeteria food.  

For an Italian place, the meatballs tasted like a frozen dinner meatloaf rolled up into little balls.  

Next served was the salad and the tomato and cheese appetizer.  These 2 I believe was the only ones I was able to eat with no problem although I think the salt that tomato/cheese app needed all was put into the Pizza.

The mixed mushroom appetizer came next and was ok.  It seemed fresh and was nice.

For the main, I chose the Fettucine, which came with Shrimps, pesto, mascarpone cheese and a touch of tomato sauce.

I won't hold back on my review because honestly, for an upscale place, I was hoping to be blown away.  The pasta was WAY overdone, there was a mixture of frozen package shrimps and the tiger shrimps so the cook on both were totally off.  I think that I would have had a better tasting pasta from the cooked food section of a Loblaws. I could not, for the love of God eat more than a bite full of this ""italian pasta"".

The Chef's selection of deserts however was good.  I think aside from the deserts, decor and the people I was with, nothing else was good.  

At the end of the night, I had to go grab dinner at Sushi Inn just so that I could have a proper Dinner.

Unfortunately, coming here with expectations and only being underwhelmed was a very big disappointment to me and my friends.  I would hope that in the future, they taste their food prior to serving them to their patrons.

3625,3,1549497600000,"Was there for brunch this past weekend.  What a great place!

Joined the fray without reservation around 11am on a Sunday.  Peak Bouchon!  Table wait was 30-mins and so we snagged a small table adjacent the bar.  Enjoyed a couple of very, very wonderful spicy Bloodie's and a nice glass of Champagne (approx $42 iirc).

Escorted to table where we met our server who was a simply wonderful woman (if TK's looking - African American 20-something) who really knew her way around the large menu and gave us great pointers.  Great sense of pace and read our table well.  To me the service is as important as the food and she was the best...

The Petit Plateau (cold seafood platter - $65) was great - wonderful oysters especially, plus great lobster in addition to mussels and clams.  Nice shared dish for the four of us.

Thereafter we all went our own ways - Croque Madame, Gravlax, Omelette and Quiche du Jour.  Couple of side dishes.  

In brief - a great unrushed brunch.  All in, including the drinks (couple of glasses wine also made it to the table) was about $60pp.  We were seated at a booth right at the back just off the bar.  Although a ""main room"" table would have been great this table offered its own charm and the bar ambiance added to the Bistro feel.

A worthy alternative to Mon Ami Gabi, though I still love that place...similar price points, maybe 15% higher at Keller's joint.  Both wonderful.",2

Vegas usually means being nocturnal and forgetting to eat. Aka during EDC weekend, I somehow didn't eat a meal for 26 hours. Yes, horrible planning on my part...  so I was ecstatic to eat some filling ramen!!

Definitely a fun place to visit and under $10! When we walked in, we were greeted by girls dressed in cute outfits and wearing wigs. It was fun to pinpoint the anime posters adorning the walls, too.

After flipping through the manga-styled menu, all of us ended up getting the Shoyru ramen. Yum yum. Perfect way to recover. Really, no complaints. Our server was helpful and the food tasted good. Not too salty.",2

All the food I've tried here is high quality. Tandoori was nice as well as the curry dishes. Staff is generally quite cordial and friendly and its never hard to get a table.",2
3666,1,1550707200000,"This place is great! I bought a bag of these little walnut cakes filled with custard and they are delicious. 

At $5 a bag, they're a great, inexpensive dessert or snack. I've also tried their regular custard buns and they were really good, similar to Hong Kong style buns but the bread wasn't as sweet. 

This is a cute little shop, seems to be family owned, I see the same couple running the place whenever I stop in. They're very courteous and proud of their shop, it's a pleasure supporting businesses like this.

The shop isn't much to look at but it's clean and welcoming. Not much place to sit, it's definitely a takeout place. 

Prices are good for what you get, which is delicious homemade baked goods. 

The only issue I have is their hours, no signage on the door or hours posted anywhere. I've tried to stop by a few times when they were closed, I have no idea what their hours are like so maybe calling ahead is the right thing to do. 

I've read that they only make limited batches of the custard walnut cakes. I was lucky enough for some to have been already made when I walked in on a Friday early afternoon, if that's helpful to anyone!",2

The restaurant itself is a small, cute space. That being said, you're always within a food of another table. Private conversations are probably not best had here. 

My only complaint was the last time I went, every 30 seconds a chef making dough would SLAM it onto the counter. It sounded like a gun shot. It made the meal really unappetizing when you're jumping every 30 seconds.",2
3709,3,1550707200000,"This restaurant is the ""real deal"": tasty food made with fresh ingredients, generous portions, reasonable prices, and a proprietor who genuinely cares about his customers' dining experience and understands the concept of customer service.  This is essentially a high-end ""fast food"" restaurant, with a clean and comfortable eating area. My friend and I had been lamenting the lack of reasonably-priced, good restaurants in the entertainment district.  After a movie at the Scotiabank Theatre, we often want to grab a bite, but are usually at a loss to find somewhere that appeals close-by, and generally leave the area.  We were planning to see an afternoon movie followed by an early evening movie, though, and didn't have a large window in between, so I consulted Yelp and came across the reviews for this restaurant just around the corner from the theatre.  We had passed this restaurant several times over the past six months or so, but hadn't really taken notice of it.

As others have noted, the owner, Corrado (""Charlie""),  is especially welcoming to first-time visitors. He offered us a complimentary rice ball, one of the restaurant's specialties.  I thanked him but, having read the earlier reviews, I knew they contained meat and told him that, because I was a vegetarian, only my friend would be able to accept his kind offer.  ""No problem,"" he said.  He was just about to make a fresh batch, and he would make me a completely vegetarian rice ball, with mushrooms, peppers and other vegetables in the centre instead of meat. He assured me that he could make the rice ball without chicken stock or any other meat products and told me that the tomato sauce that topped the rice ball was meatless.  The rice ball was delicious, and could be a small meal in itself.  My friend's background is Chinese, and he prides himself on his rice-cooking skills; whatever the type of restaurant, he rarely enjoys the rice dishes, because he finds that they are generally not cooked to his satisfaction.  He pronounced the rice ball ""really good""--high praise from him!  For our main dishes, he had the veal parmesan sandwich, and I had the eggplant parmesan sandwich.  Both were generous-sized and delicious.  My friend had asked if he could have some of the cold toppings on his sandwich, in addition to the regular hot vegetable toppings that are available. Charlie said that they're not usually added to the sandwiches, but not a problem--he asked whether perhaps my friend would prefer them on the side. ""Sure,"" he said.  In the end, when Charlie brought our sandwiches to the table, those cold toppings had morphed into a complimentary Greek salad, large enough for both of us to share. When he asked us what we'd like to drink, we said tap water would be fine.  He brought us two ice-cold bottled waters, also on the house.  Corrado's generosity to first-time visitors is, of course, an added plus, and very welcome, as is his genuine friendliness, and the generous-sized portions,  But let me emphasize that the bottom line here is that everything we ate was fresh and delicious.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and Corrado's gracious hospitality, and this will certainly be our ""go-to"" spot when we're in the neighbourhood. I'm looking forward to a return visit as a ""repeat customer""; in fact, my experience at Corrado's was so stellar that it has moved me to write my very first Yelp review.",2

Other than that (which is usually rectified by going to the F&E down the way) this Walmart is not bad. It has a very pleasing garden section that is laid out very nicely.

Now I can say I know what a chicken delight is.  The order cake with a side which I hit the cedar salad.  The only thing I disliked the chicken delight has way too much creamy sauce as well as the salad   The salad was soggy. I ended up picking up the chicken from the wrap.  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Really busy when I was there for lunch.,2
3737,1,1551312000000,"Expect this place to be packed on a Saturday. It was so packed, it was a tad frustrating when trying to navigate the aisles. I don't think I could solely shop at this store if there was one in my area but I do like that they have a lot of unique food items. Since I knew I wouldn't be back to Trader Joe's for a while, because it's so far from where I live, I made sure to really look at everything they had to offer. My favorite part of the store was the frozen foods section. There were hundreds of frozen foods I'd never seen before. So, here's what I bought: cookie butter, a trio of flavored olive oils, cinnamon coffee cake, frozen lobster ravlioli, frozen orange chicken, frozen orange juice (as recommended by a friend), creamy gorgonzola, frozen naan, frozen mac & cheese bites, a smoked ghost chili grinder, and a few clif bars in flavors I've never seen before. Total bill was $40. My favorite item so far is the cookie butter. I could literally eat it with a spoon. Actually, I did. Anyway, the lobster ravioli is delicious but you don't get much in a package. Enough for 2 people. The coffee cake was tasty. The gorgonzola, well, I guess you have to like stinky, moldy cheese, I don't. Not sure what I was thinking there but it was awful. Haven't tried any of the other items yet. The lady who rang up my groceries (Tora) was very nice and talked to me a lot and seemed to really like her job. Overall, a pleasant experience, I just wish the store was a little less busy. Maybe I'll go again on a week day.",2

Anyways, as soon as you pull up the guys run over to your car and take your order. It takes a little longer than that to get your food but they're fairly prompt and it's entertaining to watch the guys in motion. The food is VERY reasonably priced which was great.

When we got inside, the girls in front of us paid $10. When it was our turn, they said cover was $30 each. My male friend and I were shocked and asked how this happened when the girls in front paid $10. Basically they said their GM changes prices whenever he wants. Their GM, Jason, came to speak to us and was extremely rude and unprofessional. When we asked again why the cover changed, he asked us to leave. By this point, we didn't want to stay anyway as his attitude was so condescending. He does not know how to provide customer service and did not want to answer our question in a straight forward manner. Be careful Jason. Treating your customers like this will only result in Maya ending up like Axis Radius across the street.",2

I can highly recommend their salmon, as the Lemon Beurre Blanc was fantastic. My favorite, though, has to be the Norman Rockwell burger. It is a perfectly medium rare burger (can be cooked more if requested, but doing so would be a travesty), topped with bacon, american cheese, and a sunny side up egg.

While their prices are somewhat high, the quality of the food is above reproach, earning them 4 stars in my opinion.",2

The place seems like it had a ton of selection but the place is tiny. With two people in the store, I had a hard time negotiating around the store. 

I wanted to pick up a vape pen but didn't know where to start. No one said hi to me when I walked in.  I could see that the woman behind the counter didn't really seem like she knew what she was doing. She was on the phone with a guy on speaker phone and it seemed like he was guiding her around the store to show her where stuff was while a customer was waiting for her to find it. 

 I was behind someone else and really didn't feel like I was going to get any level of knowledge  out of this place so I just took off.

3802,1,1550188800000,"My puppy (1yr old 10lb schnoodle), LOVED this place! She was so happy in the photos i was sent which really made it for me. This was my first time boarding her so i was really nervous but jeanette really went the extra mile to ease my fears and answer my billion questions. Small dogs do get separated. Aggressive dogs have a separate  play area, the rooms for the dogs have glass doors so they can see out and know they are not alone. 
My dog might have peed on her bed by the smell of her blanket i got back , but that is the ONLY thing slightly negative i can say, when really that could have just been her being nervous to be there the first time. 

The real tell to knowing she enjoyed herself was when the owner put her down to run to me, which she did and was so happy of course but then turned around and ran back as if to have me follow her back to the play area. She obviously wanted me to go meet her new friends! Omg i couldnt have been happier in that moment that she was not looking like she wanted to escape but actually go back. I feel like they take extra precautions to make sure your pet is safe which is number 1 for any pet parent! 

Thank you for sending me photos of my baby girl. I will 100% be bringing her back here if i ever return for a visit.",2

I didn't go out of my way to get here, but dashed in while on an errand in this shopping center because I needed to buy a sympathy card.  I knew my choices would be far greater at Dollar Tree, but wasn't about to shlep further, when I knew 99 Cent sold cards (at twice the price).  Wrong, wrong, wrong!  They had Valentine cards.  They had birthday cards.  And that was is.  No wedding, shower, new baby, happy retirement, Nuttin' honey.  

They also don't carry sugarless sucking candy, which I get at The Other Place, so necessary because of my oral fixation.  Otherwise I'd be on a perpetual sugar high.  Sure left a sour taste in my mouth.

Just remembered while writing this that a Dollar Tree opened just a bit further, on Rainbow off Lake Mead.  Duh.",1

The food is great at Olive Garden.  All you can eat salad, and fantastic pasta dishes.  Try the Seafood Portofino!  The down side of Olive Garden in Calgary is that there is only 1 location and they don't take reservations.  That means that unless you go really early, or really late, you'll be waiting in the lobby like a knob for an hour or more.

Once you get in, the service staff are quick to take your order and on a good night, the kitchen has your order done quickly and correctly.  On a bad night, it may take half an hour or more to get your dishes out to your table.  You'll love them when you do get them though.

For the entrepreneurs out there, think about putting a burger stand in the parking lot, the people waiting will make you a millionaire!  Seriously Olive Garden, just open another location in the south!",2

Customers are not allowed to get their own coffee refills, and if you buy a $4 latte they charge you a full coffee price to get a drip refill, even when you are reusing your original cup. Some of the younger employees are quite nice and helpful, but overall the service is more in support of the corporation than the customers.",2

First of all, while we waited outside for a table, a man stood right next to their fencing between Zinburger and Pomo and blew his cigarette smoke onto all the customers that were eating outside. Not a single employee at either restaurant said anything to him. After we were seated and ordered our food, another customer was seated alone outside. As soon as the hostess walked away, her male friend went into the patio area with a large dog. The dog jumped up onto the upholstered bench and then the girl's lap. The dog proceeded to sit at the table as customers inside watched and commented on how gross that was. As we waited for our lunch, we noted that every employee that walked passed this couple stopped to chat for quite some time. We're assuming the dog owner is also an employee because everyone seemed very friendly with her. Most of the employees also stopped to pet the dog, bring it water, feed it fries, etc. and then they would immediately serve food or fill water of other customers. One waitress (with her blonde hair in a knot, large black earrings, and a black and white headband) petted the dog on several occasions then brought food to customers, picked up a water pitcher and rubbed one hand all over the spout as she carried it, etc.  Next time I eat at Zinburger, I think I'll bring my pet ferret to run around the table and between customers' legs.",3

As an avid golfer, I can say the course has never been better.  One of the gents at the course explained they use a four seed variant for their fairways and they yield an excellent blend of playablity and 'roll'.  They were top notch for certain.  The greens have always been an issue for me, until now!  They rivaled those of a Whirlwind or Ocotillo with just a touch less speed.  Very nice indeed!!  I'd give if a '5' but don't care for the lack of water stations along the course.  When I'm ready for a drink..well, you get the idea!  Ready to play again.",3

We ordered a sandwich to share and two beers (loved that they had Mother Road Tower Station on tap).  We ordered the Italian and went to the patio to soak up some sun and enjoy our beers.  I was waiting at the bar for the sandwich when a guy brought it out and said they had made the wrong one but would I want that sandwich as well.  Sure! I said.  Hubby and I began to eat it when our ""Italian"" sandwich arrived.  After the first bite, it was apparent that it was not the Italian that we had ordered, but the BLT.  Oh well, we said to eachother.  We didn't feel the need to complain even though we both couldn't beleive that they got our order wrong twice.  As we were eating, someone finally brought out the Italian we had ordered in the first place.  Third times' a charm I guess!

The sausage was fluffier than any omelet I've ever had and a delightful surprise. The potatoes and prunes were a nice heavy side to balance out the dish. The thin crispy fries were great and came in large portions. We started the meal with some oysters which really got us excited for our main dishes.

The second one was a planned c-section because I chose not to risk any complications.  We always enjoyed seeing Dr. Grade and trusted her decisions. Her nurse, Diselle, is a real sweetheart too. The only downfall was a long wait time for visits. We referred a few of our friends here, and they both complained about long wait times.  We usually scheduled our appointments first thing in the morning which helped getting us in and out quicker. If you can schedule ahead of time and get them as early as possible you are better off.

Its $9.62 after tax and you get an extra-sized takeout carton to stuff full of whatever you like. You also get a separate container that will hold probably 16oz of soup. You can also fill this to the brim with whatever tasty morsel that fits your fancy. All together, I wager you can get a good 3 lb of food crammed into that box for $9.62.

I got mostly pupus and some noodles. But you could easily squeeze ALOT of sushi into this box. At least 30 pieces. Giant Eagle will charge you like 10 bucks for about 10 pieces or so. I think Hokkaido's sushi is better than Giant Eagle's. Plus they have a greater selection.

3911,3,1549152000000,"When you pay nearly 100$ per guest for a meal that is no better than Red Lobster, then something is wrong.  

The appetizers were good, but you can hardly mess up shrimp cocktail, except that the price was 18$ for four pieces of shrimp.  Stingy!  We shared two appetizers, but it wasn't enough for three people.  The ravioli appetizer was excellent, and I would be raving about it had there been more than four pieces.  It wasn't worth spending money on, especially if you share appetizers.  

Our lobster bisque had three small pieces of lobster, a bland cream sauce, and plenty of corn bread pieces, or whatever it was.  One of my guests hardly ate her soup at all.  My other guest did eat a good deal of his Caesar Salad, however he had to ask for more dressing, and I could certainly tell it lacked an acceptable amount of dressing.

Our main dishes were fairly okay, I really enjoyed my dish, one of my guests really enjoyed his meal (however he did say there was sand in one of his scallops), however the other guest did not like her dish other than the veggies on the side.  In fact she hardly touched her food and packed it up.  

The drinks were very tasty.  The service was attentive, however I thought it was slightly unprofessional the way the menus lingered on the table for so long while it was getting crowed with two appetizers and three drinks plus three waters.  

In the end I wasted my money by coming here.  None of us felt full or satisfied.  We joked afterward that we should have just went to In-n-Out Burgers.  

I would not recommend this establishment at all.",2

Called them, the manager said they will resend, but after 1 hr of waiting, it still did not appear. Called them 3 times, but they were closed so no one picked up my calls hence I called customer centre. The girl was prompt to connect me to the store and the manager said that apparently they did but ""someone's husband answered the door declining the sour cream""..... I HAVE NO HUSBAND!! As a result, because they were closed at the time, they can't send me my sour cream so they will resend my entire order to me the next day, I even made sure to ask that they will get everything perfect right? And the manager said of course. The next day (which is today), they did as they promised, BUT AGAIN NO SOUR CREAM OR UTENSILS OR CONDIMENTS. By now, I'm really upset that this happened twice. I call the restaurant again (this was around 8pm today) and the manager again promised to send my sour cream out for me. Never happened. Called the restaurant after 1 hr of waiting and like the previous day, no one picked up my call (but this time the restaurant wasn't closed yet, they were still open for another 30 mins). Once again, I called customer centre, after explaining what happened, the girl tried to connect me to the restaurant twice, but no one picked up so said she will rush out my order for me and leave a note for the restaurant to call them back about compensation to me. About 30 mins later, I got a call from customer centre saying something about either a rush out or a $5 credit and how I can't have both. So I said I have no idea what you're talking about so she connected me to the restaurant, and they picked up! However, the manager was very rude in dealing with me, he was yelling about how they were very busy as it was a Friday night and that his TWO delivery guys were out for delivery for TWO HOURS (it has been 2 hrs since I made the call to the restaurant about my still missing sour cream). I told him that he should give me some compensation in addition to my sour cream, and he got upset, asking me what I want. As I was very upset at my missing sour cream and his rude attitude, I replied, would you give me whatever request I made, and he said to be fair with him. He told me to give him a break, but as a customer I told him that it was his duty to fulfill the order I put in perfectly. He apologized, not very nicely though mind you, but said he can't do anything cuz there are no drivers at that time, BUT THEN a driver came back. So I have FINALLY GOTTEN MY SOUR CREAM after 48 hrs.

I'm not a real fan of chain Italian restaurants, but Buca is different with the atmosphere, being able to handle large parties, and if course family-style dining. We were seated in the Pope room which is fun but little freaky. Pictures of the Pope all over with a head of the Pope on the middle of the table and the Pope chair. Strange but cool having the Pope watch you eat. 

We started off by having the Mozzarella Garlic bread which was really good, the Chopped Antipasto salad, and the Apple Gorgonzola salad. The salads were pretty good not great but I thought it had a little too much vinegar for my liking. 

We had the Margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella which I thought was very good, Chianti Braised Short Ribs where they gave us three huge ribs that were boneless and covered in gravy which was very tender and very good. We couldn't have ribs without Rosemary Potatoes (meat & potatoes kind of guy) and they were really tasty and cooked perfectly. To top it off we had the Macaroni Rosa that had macaroni (of course) with a creamy sauce and chicken, broccoli and peas. It was really good. We ate it all up and had very little leftovers so that tells you the food was pretty good. No one seemed to be holding back. 

We can't forget about desert so we had the Dolce Platter which included Tiramisu, Double Dark Chocolate cake, Cheese cake, and Apple Crostata. The deserts were fantastic. Really good and everyone enjoyed it. 

The service was right on. Filling up our water glasses, beer, wine, ice tea, and soft drinks. Food came out in a timely manner too. So I have no complaints about the service. 

So overall, I had a very good meal with lots of variety of food and massive amounts to fill up everyone. Coming here is about having a fun time and good Italian food. So enjoy, eat up but don't forget to unbuckle that belt after you eat all that food.",2

Highlights:

-The buns. Oooooh the buns. Freshly baked goodness.
-The gelato: WOW! What a standout. I didn't come here looking to try the Gelato, but the owner gave me a free sample (he said he really wants to get the word out about their in-house made gelato), and wow, was I ever glad I tried it!  For me, the Gelato outshined the burger I had. I tried the salted caramel (heaven. mmmmmmm mmmm), and the Straciatella (also yummy.) Easily some of the best Gelato I have ever had the extreme pleasure of consuming. They also have a Yelp check-in offer to upsize your Gelato for free! Score!
-The service. SOOO super friendly and helpful.
-The awesome board you can draw on while waiting for your yummy food.
-The fact that you can call ahead for your order if you're in a rush

My chicken burger was flavourful and juicy, though a bit too greasy for my liking. Minus a few points for that.

On a more positive note, the Croque Monsieur and the Seeded Roast Beef sandwich were delicious as usual. The seasonal caramel apple cider and Russian tea with orange and cinnamon were absolutely fantastic. If you make it in for the fall menu, the drinks are a must try!",2
4022,2,1550793600000,I've been here now several times and they have never disappointed.  From the Chipotle sandwich to pizza to wings - it has all been delicious.

I wanted to write a nice review for this place -- I even bookmarked it to review -- even though all we got were take-away London Fogs and brownies I could tell this place had a nice, relaxed atmosphere and the woman behind the counter was super chatty and hospitable - as long as we let her talk about herself... 

Sadly my brownie contained enough egg shells that I couldn't really enjoy it. I'll give the Bloordale Pantry another go next time I'm in the neighbourhood and will hopefully report back that this was a one time faux-pas... Until next time.",2
4033,2,1550620800000,As usual it was another FANTASTIC experience at one of Bogarts Bone Appetit locations. I usually go to the Tropicana location because it is close to my work. However this weekend I  had a few extra minutes and decided to pop into the Summerlin location for a quick mani/pedi on my beagles. The girls there were so passionate towards the calmness of the animals and seemed to really appreciate we were there. We were greeted immediately and didn't have to wait long even tho they were busy. Very efficient staff.  The selection of treats was amazing and was able to pick out the favorite treat for each pup for being such good pups. Can't wait for their next grooming appointment so we can go back. So many cool things to look at and the merchandise is full and plenty.,1

The woman in the front explained that they closed at 10, which was fine - she was polite about it. The waitress was great, very attentive and sweet (even though we were officially THOSE people who showed up 40 minutes before closing time)

Food was brought out almost immediately, great flavor & quality. Sushi was MOSTLY fish, not MOSTLY rice - it's rare that you find this. My large miso soup was LARGE - enough for two days. All portions were a very nice size.

Upon checking out, the woman in the front was pretty much telling off our waitress because she forgot to add my wine to the check - ridiculous if you ask me. They made us swipe our credit card again to pay for the wine - while the woman was still yelling at our server. Honestly, that was the only thing that I could say that was an issue this evening. The waitress handled it great though - she was awesome & I would ask for her again when we come back.",2

I finally figured out that this was a new location. We sat at the outside bar for Margaritas. Had a great bartender who was hilarious. Even though we'd had lunch earlier at another place, he got us some chips n salsa for free. They were good. Had a couple margaritas, and while maybe being a bit overpriced, I still thought they were good. I'd go back again for margaritas and people watching.",3

But, okay, it happens. Then, a few bites later, more eggshell. Then it happened a third time. I cut open the burrito and found another piece of shell that would have covered most of a dime. So I went to the counter and asked for a manager. There isn't one, I was told. An owner? Nope. So I described the problem to three women who were up front and showed them the shell. They stared at me like I had a second head. So I gave up and rejoined my wife. But then I got annoyed and went back and said I wanted a refund -- after all, I'd given back most of the burrito. The clerk said, ""Let me call the manager."" Yeah. I waited there to talk to this mystery manager but heard that she was too busy to talk to me. That's the kind of people who work there and who run the place.",2

I've been meaning to update this but I totally forgot.  I got the entire situation fixed with the help of Dana George.  I ended up having a pretty good time here.

This hotel is so unreasonable. On which planet does a hotel reward customers for booking late rather than early? It makes no sense whatsoever. Granted, I did book the non-refundable room thinking that I was getting the best possible price but for them to lower the price on the same room by 20% is absolutely ridiculous. I suggest everyone to read the fine print on their so-called ""best price guarantee"" because its so misleading. For this reason I will never stay at this hotel again and will make sure none of my friends or family do either. I hope they enjoyed making that extra $150 off of me because it's the last they will see of my money.",2

It's just another Las Vegas gimmick out for your quid (money)!,1
4073,3,1550793600000,"I don't even want to give one star but you can't post if you don't mark anything so against my better judgement, one star, under protest, it will be.

I have to say I will NEVER go back to this place again!!!! I don't know if management has changed but I can tell you that the service here has been continuously declining over the past year and TONIGHT was the W-O-R-S-T!!!! They definitely need to have 2 people behind the sushi bar because the one person thing just doesn't cut it. Even when the place is almost empty, it takes FOREVER to get your sushi. 

We've lived in Goodyear now for almost 7 yrs, meaning when we first moved to this side of the valley there were no restaurants, especially sushi places until the last 3 yrs maybe. When this place first opened we were so excited because it was much closer to home, at the time the service was excellent and fast, and the quality and quantity was worth the price. Forget that! You'd be better off going to the grocery store and buying their sushi. 

We ordered a total of 4, count them, 4 rolls tonight. The first roll was delivered rather quickly. Nice surprise, however it wasn't one of the ones I had ordered so I waited patiently. The second roll, again, not one that I had ordered was delivered probably within the next 5-10 minutes later. Wow, we thought. Service seems a little better than last time. BIG MISTAKE FOR THINKING THAT!!!!!!!! Holy crap, sat waiting for almost another 30-35 minutes watching all these other orders going out for people who came in some time AFTER, yes I said AFTER, we did but not our 2 measly rolls. 

We also had to be our own server when it came to refilling our drink. Server never came back to refill so I got up and refilled our drinks myself. Too bad we didn't order alcohol because i would have gone back to get that as well. 

I finally decided I had had enough and we got up to leave. When I was approaching the female server to ask for a bill for the sushi we did get and explain the situation she walked right by me like I was invisible or something. She came past me a second time and when I started to speak to her, she ignored me and walked over to a table that was cancelling an order because it was taking too long for them as well. When she walked past me the 3rd time and ignored me I happened to mention in a loud voice that I must be standing there for my health or something. Finally I walked over to the curtain that they have to divide the register, kitchen and hall to bathrooms from the dining area and told the lady we wanted to cancel our order, wanted the bill for what we got and that we would never come back again because service was so horrible. She said OK thank you, so we walked out. 

Hey, wait a minute, I think they owe me money since I had to play waitress. 

You know, we love, and I mean love sushi but I'd rather have to drive out of the way to a place where I know we will get service promptly and with a smile even if the place is packed to the gills, no pun intended",2

The old one exploded on the second floor of my duplex, quite the mess I must say. But I needed to get it replaced promptly as my Tenant had no hot water, you can imagine. In any case, I sourced a new tank and Quick Response installed it the following day, so only a day and a half of downtime. The nightmare was over.

Here's my biggest gripe at any eatery (a luke warm item that is to be served hot. ie Green chili fries this last visit) it's also a health issue. On this issue I put more blame on the server than the Chef/cook. Heads up to you managers, the buck stops with you. You should be checking how long it's taking you servers to pick up items and if it's taking to long jump in and get the order out to your customer. Manage all aspects of the restaurant, don't just manage to get through your shift. The better you are the better you entire staff will be. P.S. I like Zinburger and eat there 3-4 times a month.

Some tips:
- Make a reservation
- THIS IS NOT A BAR. JD was very polite in telling us this at the beginning, but I imagine it can get annoying for them. This is absolutely an educational experience.
- We did the 5 tasting, but I may recommend 10 for those that want a bit more variety.
- Don't get excited about your ""flavour profile"" it's the only disappointing part of the experience. You get asked about 4 basic questions and don't get any information to take away about how you taste, value or prefer whiskey.

I was hoping to order a pizza and a calzone or hoagie and pay the difference.  But nope it was pizza only on weekends even though the place was empty and we were getting carryout. I did want want to argue with the abrupt person taking our order.
The pizza itself was quite good.  We ordered the pesto chicken. Without groupon I never would have known about this place which is quite close to Robinson Mall.  I no longer live in the Burg but come here often and would return .  But shucks, why wouldn't you let me get a calzone!  Incidently the 3 star rating is the average of 4 for the pizza and 2 for the service.  Never understand why a person in the restaurant business can't be pleasant and if you don't like Groupon then don't offer it.",2

I told her I was coming because of the recall and would get a oil change while I was there. I changed my work schedule to make this appointment.  It was at 7 am so I could get right in.  Guess what, they did not have the parts for the recall, so it could not be done. I was told we will send out another notice when the parts come in.  My service advisor said well you are getting an oil change anyway.  I felt as if my time is not important because I didn't spend any money this time.

The restaurant has always been rather quiet, which makes it a pleasant place for conversation, and is pleasantly decorated. 

Not 5 stars because the service is a bit slow and the spiciness levels seem to vary drastically (""medium' has meant both ""just a hint of spiciness"" and ""so spicy it burns.""

4254,1,1550966400000,"My first trip to Kaya was out of sheer Monday night dinner desperation.  Having found that our first two restaurant choices were closed, my boyfriend and I headed aimlessly toward the Strip District.  We were both getting pretty hungry and frustrated at this point (our fault...should have used the mobile Yelp app to look up restaurant hours!).  We'd both heard good things about Kaya, so we decided to give it a shot.

We arrived right in time for Happy Hour (5-7pm, Monday thru Friday).  I promptly ordered a pomegranate martini...good flavor, but I found it to be a little weak.  My boyfriend and I were able to grab two seats at the bar, so we decided to order our food there as opposed to waiting 30-45 mins for a table.  I went with the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables, while my boyfriend ordered the Fish Tacos.  By this time, the Happy Hour crowd had begun to clear out, and our food arrived quickly.

I really enjoyed my Jamaican green curry.  It had a much different flavor than the green curry I typically order at Thai restaurants, but was very tasty.  It was served with some fluffy saffron rice.  The bf loved his crispy fish tacos, which was great because the portion size was large.  I tried a bite myself and had a bit of food envy.  Next time!

I found Kaya to be my favorite of the Big Burrito restaurants that I've been to.  I can't wait to go back and sample a few more items from the menu.  Although my boyfriend and I had been tired and frustrated when we first walked in the door, we found that our mood had been greatly improved by our overall experience here.  Thanks Kaya!",2
4258,2,1549670400000,"The facility itself is top notch. For a gym of this type, you won't do any better in terms of equipment. The one thing I think it's lacking - and I need to doublecheck on this - are bumper plates for Olympic lifting.

Some of the amenities that set it apart from similar gyms are:

- Sauna
- Pool
- Half-court basketball
- Sleds and space to use them
- Battle ropes and space to use them
- Really really helpful and friendly staff
- Heavy bag

So why only three stars? Ever been to LVAC at 5:30? I've been to concerts less crowded. EOS is even more crowded than that. At half the price, with better equipment, and a great location it's not terribly hard to understand why.

This is a brand-new location so maybe things will chill a bit over time, but for me I won't work out here unless I go at off hours simply because I hate waiting for equipment.

If you're OK with things being so crowded or are into the gym for social reasons, EOS will be a great choice for you. If you're a serious lifter who prefers to take a more businesslike approach to your training, I would probably pay a little bit more and go to one of the smaller gyms in the area to avoid the crowd.",2

4259,1,1550707200000,"After many attemps to find an open Filipino restaurant, we found one! And were we glad to try D'pinoy Joint.

Walking in, the decor and ambiance is very home-y and casual. Many times, when I enter restaurants, the environment plays a big role with my experience. I'm happy to say that this place gave off a ""I'm comfortable and ready to chow down and loosen my belt without judgement"" type of vibe. 

We were immediately greeted with smiles and enthusiastic hellos from the staff. It wasn't very busy at 1pm on a Monday afternoon. There were 3 of us. I'm the local one and the other two from out of town. We sat down and waters came out immediately. I have a 1-2minute mark on waters being brought out.

The menu at this place is expansive. We chose to order crispy pata binagoongan, kare-kare and pork sisig. 

The kare-kare came out first. 
The creamy, peanut butter sauce and the oxtail in that dish was just perfect. I'm picky with my kare-kare because my mom creates and crushes peanuts to create the family sauce recipe BUT I would say that I thoroughly enjoyed D'Pinoy's approach on this dish as well. 

The pork sisig came out next; this dish steamed and sizzled from the moment it left the kitchen. We wondered how our waittress carried it to our table with all the amazing flavors crackling. The sisig had the perfect crunch, crack and pop lol. The sour and savory flavors mixed well. It may have been slightly too hot due to the pork sticking slightly to the sizzle pan.

Last but not least was the crispy pata binagoongan. This dish is huge. 3 of us together could not finish it. It was definitely crispy, full of meat and absolutely delicious. The pork skin wasn't rubbery. The binagoong on it was drizzled; you can order it on the side but I believe it's always better to just have it all mixed in. 

The service was great at this restaurant. Staff was making jokes and really providing a fun and family-style atmosphere. We definitely needed boxes so they provided those. Check came out. Payment was easy (they don't take discover cards). 

We left with full stomachs and the desire to come back. We were going to check out red canyon and we HAD to go home to make sure we left the leftovers in the fridge. It was THAT good.

He is also an amateur photographer and he still works with film, so he likes the film development here.

As a busy university student, I do not have time to mess around with mascara or fake lashes, so I am very thankful that I have Collette! A talent like no other and her service remains undefeated. Collette is the real deal (no horror stories here). I have been faithfully going to her for almost 3 years. Her new studio is so accessible- one that might miss it, may be sightless. I live in Henderson and it takes me 15 min to get there and I have never had any problems. I look forward to seeing Collette, not only get my flawless lashes done, but also after many years she has become a great confidant. The rarity of a successful client/stylist is priceless, and I am so glad that I have Collette. 

Ohhh Collette, thank you for actually caring about my real lashes and the quality of lashes you apply to my real lashes! That right there tells you, again, a respectful, reputable eyelash technician, who ACTUALLY cares about the quality of product (lashes) and the *longevity* of which they last--- and they last a long time!

(http://www.yelp.com/biz/vegas-seafood-buffet-glendale#hrid:JnIwxV7PDcIRU7PhAETMrA) 

I bet Imperial Palace's buffet (do they have one?) is better. I know the Flamingo buffet is. 

The line to get in is like waiting for Riddler's Revenge in Six Flags Magic Mountain. Too bad it doesn't store as much excitement. Usually people line up for vegas buffets because the food is actually good. This just has a line because they give everyone who stays in the hotel, two for one meal vouchers. I should know, I had one.

When you finally get in, you think the line is finally over. WRONG! You enter and you line up to get food. From the PATHETIC sushi selection, to the chow mein makers, to the g0Dd@mn salad bar. lines, lines, LINES! By this point, I am starving. The salad maker wouldn't even help me. There was 1 lady helping 25 people in line. TI, would you please hire more employees? 

I barely tried anything in this buffet. I stuck to the American/BBQ section. Their (spare)ribs were dry, the chicken was OK, and I piled up on the collard greens. Honestly, I was so hungry, I was just eating whatever to shut my belly up. The desserts were not memorable. Though I do love me some buffet cookies. 

I will not be back.. Unless I get another free voucher.. Which may not be likely because I never want to stay at TI again. It's just a ghetto hotel that needs to be destroyed already. Time for a new skyscraper hotel again.",2

Concert was supposed to start at 7 but we had to listen to crappy DJ's whose sound system was malfunctioning. Chris Brown came on two and a half hours later. Getting out of the parking lot was hell. Took almost an hour to get out. Park at the end of the lots if you are going to come here for a concert.",3

It's funny because for a sushi place the steak tasted better. Morimoto toro tartar was whatever. Tiny amount of sturgeon caviar. Famous dish so ordered it but was not impressed. 

Cod was pretty good. 

Sushi was pretty good. 

Spent over $500 for my friend and I. I enjoyed going once but probably won't go back. I give this place 3 stars but the steak is a 5 star easy. There are better restaurants in Vegas. Let's just say that.",2

4480,1,1550793600000,"C'est le genre de café que j'aimerais avoir plus près de chez moi. Peut-être que dans un coin moins touristique de Montréal il serait moins constamment bondé de gens? Parce que oui, Olive et Gourmando est rapidement passé du bouche à oreille à un haut lieu touristique, et avec raison: Les pâtisseries et viennoiseries y sont tout simplement divines, ils font de délicieux lattés et leur liste de sandwichs est à faire saliver même les plus difficiles mangeurs de ce monde. Ils ont tellement de choix appétissants qu'après ma première visite, où je m'étais délectée d'un latté et d'un croissant aux amandes, je n'ai pas pu résister et je suis repartie avec  une brioche au chocolat Valhrona et bananes. ""Je n'en mangerai que la moitié et je proposerai le reste à mes collègues de travail"" que je me suis dit, mais aussitôt déposée sur le bureau de mon patron que la tentation fut trop forte et le reste de la brioche vint se transformer en taille supplémentaire de pantalon. 

Il faut choisir son moment lorsqu'on veut faire un tour chez Olive, puisque comme je disais plus haut c'est un lieu hautement touristique et qu'il est difficile d'avoir une place pour plus qu'une personne pratiquement chaque matin de la semaine.

4481,3,1550620800000,"Great restaurant/lounge on 7th street. I've only had apps there as the food is not my fav (my taste buds only). Crystal, the new bartender, is AWESOME! She is right on top of drinks, food, everything! I'm sure the other bartenders are great as well, just haven't had a chance to meet them yet. When we were there the staff was setting up for a very large birthday party that was supposed to be outside on the smoking patio. Then it started raining. Instead of displacing those of us in the bar, they were able to accommodate current customers and the large party in the dining room. The owner was right in the middle of the mix helping to move things around and get set up rather than barking orders. He seemed to create more of a family feel with the staff and customers, thus making everyone feel comfortable. 

We ordered the quesadilla and the calamari. The onion-ring-looking calamari has this very light breading that was just perfect. The quesadilla was huge and filled us up quickly. There is a red salsa-tasting sauce that comes with the calamari that was very good. The other sauce (not sure what it was) didn't compliment the calamari very well. Crystal suggested the chipoltle crema sauce, which went with both the calamari and the quesadilla. I have had the chips and salsa before and that's definitely worth trying as well. All the apps are 1/2 off during happy hour. 

It's under new ownership so if you haven't been there for a while, check it out again.  I also heard a rumor they are opening for lunch starting next week.  Curious to see that menu.",1

4502,3,1549756800000,"Finally went today after living in Phoenix over 5 months now. (Hooray for being here 5 months!) I went for lunch with a friend/co-worker. The line was super long, but they placed a female employee in the line who took orders and swiped your credit card even before you made it to the counter. I'm sure this helps moves things along during their lunch and dinner rushes. The employee in line and the counter gals were not overly friendly. Actually, you could tell they pretty much hate their jobs. 

Now on to the food. I had the ""naked"" chicken burrito. I'm sure they call it something else at Chipolte, but I don't remember what. The price was right, but lacked the extras I get at Qdoba. Less toppings- no free chips, less salsa choices, and no extra sauces. And $1.80 extra for guac?! Yikes. Overall I prefer Qdoba in flavor, selection, and overall experience.

4525,3,1549670400000,"Checked this place out tonight and was thoroughly impressed. 
Come here with the perspective of wanting Mexican food out of the ordinary and not something to satiate you in the middle or after a night of drinking. 

In terms of the environment, the decor was awesome. The murals throughout the restaurant were unique and artistic especially the bookcase in the back of the restaurant. They help to bring a sense of liveliness with a Mexican influence that is lacking in downtown Phoenix. 

Service was attentive with great recommendations from our server, Ben, throughout the course of the meal. Ben provided thorough descriptions of the menu items that were unfamiliar to myself and the others in my party. 

Regarding the food, my party and I had the chips and salsa, a selection of tacos, the scallop entree, and the Mexican panna cotta. The salsas all had great and distinctive flavors and were complemented from the crunch and well-seasoned tortilla chips. The roja was my favorite as it had the right bit of brightness and spice. The tacos (al pastor, baja fish, and duck carnitas) were the highlight of the night. While the tacos themselves were small, they were filling and packed with flavor, especially the duck carnitas. Each taco had the right balance of richness and acidity. The tortillas were soft and hand-made in the restaurant that helps to set them apart from other Mexican restaurants in the area. The scallops were phenomenal; they were a great size and perfectly cooked. The grits served as an accompaniment is something I would order on its own as they were delicious, luscious, and creamy. The panna cotta was the perfect ending to the dinner, light, fruity, with a little bit of spice. Overall, I came here for an experience outside of regular Mexican/Tex-Mex and was wholly satisfied. 

Some of the cocktails may need a deeper explanation and/or some work on, but this place has a lot of potential especially since it has just opened so recently. I look forward to returning.",2

4584,2,1551139200000,"I went into this Vivah Jewelry a few weeks ago, planning on making a quick purchase. Little did I know, this simple purchase would turn into a long drawn out adventure.

This location, like all other locations, was (is?) having a 50-60% off sale. I had recently started a new job in the area and was looking to get something nice for my mom. Just a little token gift with my new salary, not exactly breaking the bank, I know.

During one of my 15 minute breaks, I stopped by the store to look around. It's a very small store with not much area. There was a customer being helped by a saleswoman and some displays and cases. I waited patiently to be helped by the saleswoman, not interrupting them. I looked around a bit and stood off to the side. In the 5 minutes I waited, I was not looked at or acknowledge by the saleswoman. No ""hi one minute"" or ""sorry I'm busy"". Not even a glance in my direction. I'm a young male who doesn't look like he frequents shops like this, still, I felt it was terrible service and left the store annoyed. 

I decided to give it one more try during my lunch break. When I returned to the store, there was a different saleswoman behind the counter. She ended up being extremely nice and helpful. Honestly, I was surprised at the polar opposite of the service (or lack thereof) I had gotten earlier. I would be happy to deal with her again. I decided to buy a watch with turquoise stones on the band and left happy.
When I gave it to her, my mother liked the watch very much. However, after wearing it a few times, she noticed some of the stones had fallen out and you could see glue residue on the metal. Disappointed, I was worried about returning/exchanging the watch because it was on sale and usually that means all purchases are final. 

I decided to call Vivah Jewelry's offices using the # on their website to see if I had any options. I reached their repair line and spoke with a very pleasant woman. She explained that I could return the watch to the store I got it from to have them send it in for repair. She assured me there would not be any cost in doing so.

When I returned to the store to turn over the watch for repairs, the first saleswoman I had dealt with happened to be there. While she acknowledged me this time, I was the only one in the store. I told her what the repair lady had told me and gave her the watch. She then produced another from the cabinet and gave it to me. While I appreciated this, she told me that my mom should be careful not to be too rough with the watch or bang it into things. I found this somewhat insulting because I know my mom is careful with her jewelry. And even if she accidentally bumped into something, it really shouldn't be hard enough to dislodge stones from the band. 

After my experience, I am unsure about shopping at Vivah Jewelry again. Some salespeople are pleasant, some really aren't. And it's not like they're the only option for relatively inexpensive jewelry. Perhaps if everyone was as pleasant as the second lady I dealt with, I would be more likely to return.",2

At Joe's Farm Grill, it could easily be the amazing ingredients. So fresh and flavorful, and you know you aren't eating some strange lab grown tomatoes. I love sitting outside under a GIANT tree, looking over at the Agritopia garden... Joe's definitely has something you don't find very often here in the commercial, cookie cutter East Valley.

Like Joe's BBQ, everything here is perfect it its own way. My favorite is the burger. Yup, I said it. Veganish me loves cheeseburgers here. I don't eat burgers often, but when I do I crave Joe's. The bun is amazingly fresh and soft, the veggies are top notch and the meat... The meat is melt in your mouth delicious.

I thought it fit but a month later it was sliding down my hips and I could not return. It had a side zipper, beaded tassels, and beads all over. It was not an easy project.....this I was sure. I thought it was on the expensive side but after I saw the quality of her work I was reassured why. I had an amazing Eastern European seamstress in Berlin and I found Marianna to be better. The skirt was perfect and I have never seen that kind of result on something so complicated. I have had many tailors over the years and I know when something is exceptional. I actually tried another business called Southland Prestige Alterations in hope that I might find someone good at a better price. Well, this place was slightly cheaper but they ruined a dress that I considered to take much less skill. I believe this level of skill at Marianna's is unique. She is more of a dress maker than anything. I would trust her with my most expensive pieces in a heart beat. I already have pulled some lovely items out of my wardrobe for her to bring new life to.

4652,1,1550707200000,"As with some of the other reviews I've read we've had a TERRIBLE time with customer service and how our account has been handled by Sparkletts since they took over O Premium Water.  They said they would honor our contract with O Premium which was an unlimited amount of water monthly for the amount we were paying O Premium (we use the water for cooking, ourselves and our five pets and also wanted extra bottles that we could use for an emergency situation).

As time went on they began taking back water bottles and not replacing them.  I called them and was told they did not do unlimited water and I spent an hour on the phone with them and finally settled for 16 bottles of water a month for a similar cost.  Again after a while went by they began taking bottles and not replacing all the ones left out.  When I called them this time I was told the account manager had changed our water amount based on our usage.  I again reminded them that we were also using the water for water storage purposes (and by the way they did not reduce our monthly bill).  We went back and forth and finally I was told the account manager would call me back.  This never happened and I have been working on an alternate solution since.

Funny thing although they didn't honor the orginal O Premium agreement nor their verbal contract with me they wanted to take back the water cooler (which is about 10 years old and was paid in full 5 years ago) and to charge me the $52 cancellation fee that O Premium had in their contract.  Apparently the contract only protects them and not the consumer.  I'm really glad we can be done with this company the customer service has been abhorrent.  Honestly I don't even want to give them ONE STAR.",2

I got the longanisa breakfast. It comes with an longanisa(filipino sausage),egg, garlic fried rice, and slices of tomato. Overall it was good but for 6.99 and only two pieces of longanisa I felt cheated. I think there pieces for that platter would be more fitting. Also the garlic fried rice was a bit bland and too soft for MY taste, and the serving bowl they put it in was a bit awkward to eat out of. 

I also got the pork bbq skewer which was great but then again I felt cheated as they only filled the skewer halfway. Whenever I got that bbq skewer usually i dont have a place to hold it because it's usually filled up. They could just use smaller skewers so at least that way it won't look so empty.

4673,3,1549929600000,"There are a few a good reason why I've chosen to stay at the Flamingo Las Vegas for the last 4 out of 5 Vegas trips.  First and foremost, the hotel is central to everything.  Once you park your car, you can pretty much forget about it until you checkout because the Flamingo is within walking distance to everything in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip.  Anyone who's been to Vegas knows how bad the traffic can get so this is worth its weight in gold.  Second, thanks to renovations in the early 2000s, the Flamingo has a pretty nice atmosphere to it.  Sure the color schemes are quite cheesy, but don't forget this is Vegas we are talking about.  The property has a tropical feel to it and in the courtyard they even have live penguins and flamingos for you to visit.  As for the rooms, they are among the most spacious in terms of basic rooms (non-suites).  If you are taking groups, a lot of their rooms connect and there is plenty of floor space.  You'll find pretty much a lot of the standard table games in the casino, and the table minimums are pretty much whatever the going rate is (i.e. $10 blackjack on the weekends).  They have a poker room, and although it is small (~10 tables), I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a seat.  Now the big reason that makes me such a big fan of the Flamingo can only be experienced during the summertime-the pool!  It sprawls over 13 acres and has waterslides, waterfalls, islands, you name it.  Its definitely a great place to relax when the 100-degree heat is beating down on you.",2

I could've of used a little more griot.  I also got two pates one of chicken and one of beef. Delicious! The food did bring back some great  memories.

4686,2,1549670400000,"I stopped by Kaya in my search for an amazing burger in Pittsburgh (spoiler: Winghart's won by a mile).  The Kaya burger looked unique and delicious, so I set out across town to try one.

Maybe it was the beef (which did arrive cooked perfectly), or maybe it was just that the kaya sauce just didn't jive with the fried egg, pickles, and avocado.  Whatever it was, while I enjoyed the burger (great bun, and delicious fries), it didn't WOW me like I had hoped it would.

The interior is super cute, and the service was good though the kitchen was slow.  That gave me more time to drink, which is always fine, though Kaya's bar was a little on the light side for worthwhile beers.

3.5 stars, rounded down, but I will without question be stopping by Kaya next time I'm through Pittsburgh to try some of their other menu items.  I expect great things.",1

4688,2,1549324800000,"I was in town for work this week and was nosing around for some good italian cuisine.  I typed in ""cacio e pepe"" to see what hits I would get.  I first had this dish in Rome last fall and I was jonesing for a fix.

I arrived by myself around 7:00pm and had no trouble getting a seat.  I chose to sit at the pizza bar, even though I wasn't planning on getting the pizza.

Zenia was my waitress and she did a great job.  I came for the cacio e pepe, but she talked up the meatballs enough to pique my interest.  She was willing to give me a smaller version of the meatball starter (essentially a side of two meatballs in sauce).  She asked if it was okay if they were plated together and I requested that they be plated separately.  I was brought some bread and olive oil to nosh on while waiting for my meal.  The bread wasn't remarkable, but it did a find job of sopping up some of my leftover tomato sauce.

My food arrived extremely quickly and it looked beautiful.  The pasta was terrific.  The noodles were nicely al dente and that familiar black pepper taste was prominent.  I ate it all.  The meatballs were good, but didn't wow me.  Which is fine, because I'll eat that pasta all day.

One of the most enjoyable parts of my dinner was being able to chat with the folks on the other side of the pizza bar making salads and pizzas.  They were extremely friendly and happy to answer any questions that I had about their pizza oven and how they make their pizzas.

The next time I'm in town, I will happily make time to venture up the Mirage to chow down on the cacio e pepe at Osteria Costa.  And I'll try the pizza.",2
4689,1,1550620800000,"Cowboy Cio.. What a bizarre and lovely little place. If you sit at the bar, you will be greeted with a smile and a handshake by the bartenders. In all of my dining experiences, I've never had multiple bartenders make sure to shake my hand and introduce themselves. This type of warmth was indicative of the experience I had at Cowboy Ciao. 

On to the food:

The 4 piece bruschetta came with 2 pieces topped with diced tomatoes and 2 pieces topped with mushrooms. The tomato bruschetta was zesty with delicious, biting acidity... screaming for a wine pairing. The mushroom bruschetta hinted at something delicious but was the least impressive item I tried this evening. (Although it was the least impressive, it was still yummy).


The scallops, wow. Cork flakes? Coriander? Bacon? Who knows and who cares. This was a very nicely planned and plated dish. I will definitely struggle to order anything else on my next visit. 

Dessert, that I wasn't going to order: oh, Canada peanut butter bar. This was a little slice of heaven. With a creative take on a peanut butter and chocolate dessert, hints of coconut take this to the next level. 

When you're all done, ask the bartender about the speakeasy around the corner. 

Overall, Cowboy Ciao is a must try.",2

4701,2,1550793600000,"The first time I visited Wicked was exactly one year ago.  My husband and I were in town visiting family and I remember hearing about Wicked on the Oprah show.  In one of the Oprah shows Gayle King did a cross-country cupcake/dessert tour and she raved about Wicked, particularly the red velvet cupcakes.  Figuring there must be something great about it I decided to check it out when we were in town.

The bakery is somewhat small with a tiny display and not much room to sit and enjoy the cupcake.  Nothing against that, just wanted to point it out.  I immediately honed in on the red velvet cupcake.  Slade was there and he let us sample some lychee chewy treats he was trying out.  I thought that was very nice of him.  I decided to go on blind faith and order my father-in-law's birthday cake there.  Considering it was for the next day Slade was accommodating and offered suggestions on what type of cake to make.

Ok, so with the red velvet cupcake I found it to be so-so.  I have found that it is tough to make a moist red velvet (unless I'm just going to the wrong places) so I wasn't too surprised that it wasn't moist.  I was a bit put off by all the cream cheese frosting on it.  I much prefer Kara's or Love at First Bite's frosting since there's less focus on the frosting on more on the quality of the cupcake.  The birthday cake we ordered was a tiger cake.  Basically it is a marble cake.  It turned out pretty good, but not fabulous like I would expect from a favorite of Gayle and Oprah!

So fast forward to current times and we're back in Phoenix.  So we go back to Wicked and this time we try the vanilla creme brulee, double chocolate, and the peppermint chocolate.  

Vanilla creme brulee: The cake part was not very moist.  It was a bit spongy but not moist so it felt like a mouthful when I would take a bite.  The frosting wasn't overwhelming like the red velvet but also nothing to write home about.  It had these little black balls sprinkled on top that gave it a crunch, which I assume is to represent the crunchy sugary cover on a creme brulee.  I wish there was a bit more though.  The inside had a vanilla filling but there was so little of it you would blink and it's already in your mouth.

Double chocolate: The cake part was super-moist so it definitely made up for the disappointment of the creme brulee.  The frosting was not too sweet and overall the chocolate wasn't overpowering.

Peppermint chocolate: This isn't really a cupcake but it looked more like a muffin.  It's located in the glass display whereas the cupcakes are in plastic displays on top of the glass display.  I LOVE peppermint almost to a point of obsession so I was very excited to try this one.  Unfortunately that excitement didn't last too long.  I don't know if I waited a day to eat it but it wasn't very moist.  There were chocolate chips but you wouldn't know it because you couldn't really taste it.  And, I tasted almost no peppermint flavor in it.  How disappointing!

I am extremely bummed that this place did NOT live up to it's hype.  I suggest you go here with very little expectations!

Update (1 day later):

   Slade responded to my review.  I like how his response was immediate.  It shows he is concerned about the quality of his product and provided the solution to some of my concerns.  According to him the fillings were not done correctly at the time and they will be taken care of.  So if you do still plan to try Wicked out I hope your have plenty of filling in your cupcake! Also, apparently the employee did NOT give me a peppermint brownie because they didn't make peppermint brownies that day.  I apparently was given a double chocolate one.   I guess that means I'll have to return and try their peppermint choc. brownies!",2

4707,2,1549238400000,"5 incredible stars. Thank you so much Bobby and Zeneta for taking such wonderful care of our fur children, Mochi & Bailey. Simply amazed at the energy, professionalism and genuine care of all the pets you take in. If I could give them a bazillion stars, I would. 

My dogs are my family. Both are rescues and are like kids to me. Mochi specifically was a therapy dog for me when I suffered from an arrhythmia; she was also my big sister Evelyn's therapy dog when she suffered from cancer and was also there when my sis took her last breath at the hospice. So needless to say, Mochi and Bailey rescued us and mean the absolute world to me and my family. I do not leave them with just ANYONE, especially since we've had horrible experiences at other pet boarding places.

The minute the co-habby called and spoke with Bobby, we were immediately reassured that we chose the right place! Bailey is special needs and Mochi has some personality issues when it comes to larger dogs and Bobby understood our requests completely. Upon dropping them off, we were greeted by his gorgeous wife Zeneta. As soon as you walk into the lobby, the smell is just so fresh and clean you would have no idea that you were at a pet hotel. And the high roller suites are ridiculously cool!!! Chewy Vuitton room anyone?? I almost wanted to stay there myself, lol. Each room has a flat screen TV which blew my mind. 

Zeneta was confident about dogs and their interaction with one another and made sure by taking us over to outdoor doggie play area. And like she said, they both did great! Someone is always there watching the dogs so no rough housing will occur. We left to go to the Elara and felt immediately happy that we chose Luxe Pet Hotels. They even sent us text photos of our dogs playing and gave us status updates. LOVE THAT!

Upon picking them up, we met Bobby who was kind in person as he was on the phone. Zeneta even took the time to feed our dogs and smash up Bailey's food because she has no teeth like the senior citizen dog she is, lol. I will absolutely not hesitate to take them back here because Mochi, who is super picky, behaved like she didn't want to leave!!! Which NEVER happens!! 

We can't wait to bring them back here when we return for my birthday in the summer. Thanks a million Bobby, Zeneta and staff for truly caring about our pets and making sure they had a blast!",1

4721,2,1548979200000,"First, I'll post my disclaimer about Vegas restaurants:
I believe restaurants on the Las Vegas strip are often very overrated. My theory: People are in Vegas to party and have a good time. They often eat at these places while they're having a great time regardless of the quality of the food or restaurant. When they go to write a yelp review, they assume that the high price tag and the fun evening must mean that the restaurant was great. 

Despite all of this, I was pleasantly surprised by Bouchon. It doesn't have that fake night club vibe. The venue itself isn't designed to distract from the dining experience. In fact, it compliments it. It looks and feels like a french bistro without trying too hard. The outside terrace is also a great touch. 

The food itself was also great. I had the steak frites, and a great melon and prosciutto salad. Yes, for the first time, I actually enjoyed a melon and prosciutto salad.  They have reasonably priced wines, and good coffee.",2

We also waited with our empty plates in front of us for 20 minutes while he gave the tables around us what we overheard to be very friendly service. I'm assuming this is because my boyfriend and I are in our mid 20's and the nearby tables were older couples. I realize Yorkville is known to be a snobby part of town, but I have frequented other restaurants in the area and have never had a service issue.

4740,1,1550966400000,"There are a few things that have influenced my rating. They are listed below:

1) Confusion from front desk staff around how to apply payment for rooms booked through an organization credit card. There was initially holds on each of our individual credit cards that took some time to work out - there was additional confusion when checking out since fees were pre-paid.

2) Twice in my room, things were left by housekeeping - the first day after I'd had cleaning done, a green cleaning cloth was left on my dresser. The second day a black thong underwear was left in my closet. (It didn't belong to me)

3) Lastly, I had one of the most unpleasant experiences in the hotel restaurant - Urban Farmer - with the wait staff and the restaurant manager. I still have yet to receive a call from the general manager which was my request. The waiter was obnoxious and not patient with me around an order I was placing so much so that my table was even responding ""What's wrong with him?!"" He brought me part of the order that I had specifically asked him not to bring and when I complained, he was dismissive. When I asked to speak to the  manager, someone came out and after my complaint, he only answered that I was being loud and aggressive. (I was indeed angry and frustrated and agree that I was using swear words to describe how the exchange with the waiter went down) - when I then pointed out that there were no black patrons in the restaurant except me and that it didn't bode well that I was being treated this way, the manager pointed out that this wasn't true...that his entire staff was black. I was offended by the racially profiled characteristic of being loud and aggressive coupled with emphasizing all of his staff were black as if to make up for the fact that there are no black patrons in the restaurant. Not once did he apologize on behalf of his wait staff and my experience until I highlighted this fact - the apology was not genuine. After trying to speak with someone above him, the food and beverage manager called the general manager and he said he would get in touch with me, I have yet to receive a call. My experience in Cleveland has been marred by this very unpleasant exchange, lack of remorse for my experience, and lack of follow up by the hotel staff.",2

She babbled about the menu, and steered us away from the most exciting concept of this new ""American"" cuisine restaurant....the supposedly locally grown monthly chef's menu.  She noted several times that they were proud of their ""scratch"" kitchen, and the menu had our mouths watering.  

Everything was just OK at this point - we weren't going to let a bad server ruin our night.  Until every other waiter offered their tables bread but ours, so we sat for 40 min. with no bread, no visit from our waitress, who was busy goofing off and flirting with everything and everyone on staff.  When our food finally came, we realized REALLY quickly, that there was nothing fresh nor creative, nor yummy about this food.  It was so disappointing.  On top of it all, it was super expensive.  I paid $22 for a steak and $25 for ribs that I could have gotten better at Perkins off the beltline, and I would never even go there.  We wondered how the food could have possibly been executed so poorly.

The food/veggies was so overcooked and felt like the whole meal came ""fresh"" from the microwave or a leftover Tupperware container.  Mashed potatoes were clearly from powder and scooped onto the plate with an industrial scooper, the BBQ sauce tasted allot like the Kraft crap at the grocery store. I guess all we were missing were the Bush's baked beans, b/c EVERYTHING was from a can not from scratch.  We were sad.

The worst part about this place is that it could be so great.  The menu, if cooked and presented properly is a great concept, they have obviously dumped allot of money into this place.  I hope that the investors wake up soon, try the amazing food of their competitors in town (Harvest, Sardine, Brasserie V, Quivey's Grove, Great Dane...and the list goes on), study the competitive pricing, and get the chef some cooking lessons.

Places that do just one thing but do it very well.
Self-serve.
Real frozen yogurt that actually tastes like yogurt.

Razzy fresh combines these three virtues. The yogurt is delicious (I'm partial to the original and raspberry), as are the toppings (fresh berries, mango, kiwi, etc.). At about $0.50 an ounce it's a bit pricey (I can rarely keep my portion under 8 oz.), but worth it considering the quality.",1

4862,1,1550102400000,"This was the worst experience I ever had, my father and I have given this place 3 chances which have all ended in failure. 1) the burgers are not made to order, they are dry as a burnt piece of toast 2) the mangers seem to be a know it all.

We went in and ordered the fish and chips and the broccoli cheddar soup. We got our soup only to find that not only did it have a slim like texture but both my father and I ask for the manager. They only question that was asked was; ""what kind of cheddar do use?"" The manager said that they use yellow, so if that's the case then why is it green? She then made a comment that because broccoli is green the soup will be green. We told here that's not the issue, the issue was that the soup was no good. We asked if we could exchange the slime soup for the New England clam chowder.

This is where the she dropped the ball, she brings out soup and just walks away. And to my surprise a watered down broken up chowder soup. I asked for the manager again asking when was the soup made, she assures me that it was made fresh in the morning. That is when we called her out on her bullshit. She made a comment to my father saying that he doesn't know what he's talking about. I cut her off and told that my father has worked as an executive chef for 26+ plus years, and that I've been a casino main kitchen cook for 5 years. I told here that the chowder was made a few say ago. I told here I've made 50+ gallons of not only clam chowder but many different soups to the point that I know if the product is made fresh or just a reheat.

I've already contacted their corporate office.

4863,1,1550620800000,This tropical smoothie cafe location is the worse!!! I ordered a smoothie and had to wait 55 minutes to get it!!! There was no AC inside and the weather was 112 degrees. The guy at the cashier left and the only person inside was the guy making the smoothies. There were a whole bunch of people waiting to order and no one was there to help them. People who came 30 minutes after me got their smoothies first. It was a HORRIBLE experience. I will never come back to this location. The place was soooo dirty and stinky!! Save your money and time and go somewhere else.,2

I opted for soup with my drunken beef noodles.the soup was brothy loaded with cabbage and onions a nice tangy spicey finish. No idea what it was called. 
The drunken beef arrived from the nuclear reactor steamy aromatic and tasty.. heavy on the egg.. basil strewn through.. the beef was tender and flavorful. I ordered ""Thai hot"" 4th on the hot chart but it could have been a bit spicier. 
I want to try more items and different soups. A lot of potential. I will return for more great service and ice cold water!!!",2
4865,3,1549584000000,"Yesterday was my fifth visit to Copacabana.  So now I feel I can write a fair review about the place.

The good.

Great atmosphere and decor.  It's like having dinner at an all inclusive resort.  Very friendly & attractive employees. (can't help but noticing it, trust me)
The food.  Great variety of meats and excellent salad bar.
Great live music.

The bad? Or as I'll call it, what should be improved upon.

Cocktails a bit pricey for that part of town.  Beer prices for bottles at pint prices.

One thing about eating out at one place is that if you go enough times you start to notice trends.  Things like, how consistent are the staff in terms of helpfulness and friendliness, the quality of the food, levels of service ,etc.  What became clear to me at Copacabana is that they have a plan for every table that gets filled.  Pretty much once you are seated and have your first drinks, the BBQ comes to your table at a fast rate.  ""Morrocan chicken sir?  Garlic steak sir?""  It seems that they want to inundate you with the meats right off the bat, fill you up, get you out and turn over the table to the next group.  

When we got there the place was maybe 25% full and slowly climbing so for the most part all tables were getting served at the same time.  You'd see anywhere from 4-6 guys at a time moving around and serving. Then after a while, they'd all disappear for about 10-15 minutes.  And when they come out they whizz by your table and pretty much forget you were there.  Now I can imagine they're hitting up new customers like they did with us, but after five visits, I can say this is somewhat deliberate.  I'd say their goal is to turn a table around in 90mins to two hours max, unless you're ordering a lot of drinks.

I can understand they're a business and are trying to maximize their profits but after five visits, I can honestly say I feel like I'm being pushed out the door.  I like to take my time and relax when I'm having a meal.  If I want to save time and shove food into my mouth I'll go grab a burger.  When I sit down at a nice restaurant to eat I'm there to socialize more than I am to dine.  I feel rushed at this place.  Even when we turn over the card to the ""blue"" side to hold them off, they just ignore it, place the skewer on your table and ask ""who wants some?""  That there tells me they want to turn the table over quickly.

The value for the money is there.  The meats are a little over seasoned at times, but you don;t have to take everything they bring.  

If anyone from the restaurant reads the reviews here, my advice is simple.

1.) Have the carvers hold off if they see the blue sign. Don't try to stuff your guests to move them out quicker.  Allow your guests more down time between servings.
2.) Ease back on the salt. Most cuts of meat do not need it at all.
3.)Lower the drink prices.  Chances are more people will sit down longer and order more drinks.

In conclusion, by no means is this place a lost cause, but there is room for improvement. The value for the meal is very good as there is a lot of variety and the salad bar has a lot of fresh items to choose from.  Most steak houses will run you at minimum $50/person with one drink so this place is on par or better due to the variety.  This place can be a lot of fun, especially when the dancers show up.",2
4868,3,1549065600000,I was in Vegas about a week ago and was craving something sweet at 2 in the morning. Luckily this bakery is open 24/7! It would've dangerous for me to live in Vegas knowing I can get my hands on yummy desserts any hour of the day. My only complaint is how pricey it is. The ones I chose were $9 each. I had a fruit tart and a key lime tart. They were both delicious and beautifully presented. The fruit tart was topped with a variety of fruits and the filling was not overly sweet. The key lime tart is my favorite. The tartness from the lime balanced well with the white chocolate. It left my mouth was watering the whole time. I can't wait to go back!,3
4876,1,1550620800000,"Ive only been here twice, but both times, the food and service was amazing.

Apparently the pepperoni was very good... it looked different than the cheese so it may have different seasonings and preparation along with the addition of pepperoni. The up side was that the service was pretty good and the daily specials that they have are an awesome value. $3 for a slice and two beers is an amazing deal.",2
4883,2,1550102400000,"I've only been here for lunch - three times to be precise - and I'm just not as impressed as y'all.  For lunch, they have this strange buffet service for everything except salads.  Counterintuitive, I know.  Usually they don't have anyone at the front desk to seat you, which is awkward.  Just go into the dining room and someone will figure out that you are there eventually.

If you want a sandwich, you need to get your lazy ass up, order from the guy with the chef's hat behind the sneeze guard, wait until he dishes out your food, go to another station to get your condiments, and walk your food back to your own damn table. Given the fact that the servers only have to fetch salads and drinks, you'd think the service would be excellent.  But unfortunately that's not the case.  

Drink refills tend to be hard to come by.  So much that when they drop off your drink, they'll give you a little carafe of extra soda, ice tea, whatever you ordered.  Because they ain't coming back.  If they gave you the wrong drink while you were off waiting in line for someone to make your sandwich, good luck getting it fixed.  It's also hard to get the check for some reason.  But the servers look really busy and there are a lot of them so they must be doing something.  I can never figure out what.  It's really hard to get their attention.  And never come on Administrative Assistant's Day or Bosses' Day or any of those made up holidays because it only gets worse with all the offices around this restaurant.  We loves us some fake holidays.

The sandwiches are pretty good and this is the only place in town that I know of that you can get a full turkey dinner for lunch anytime of the year.  It costs $24 but, still, it's nice to have the option.  The food is pretty decent but, in my experience, the service falls short, at least during lunch.",2
4883,3,1550966400000,"Loved the food here! The pierogi and meatball plate was delicious and I would recommend to anyone who enjoys pierogis. The honey cake was also a unique dessert. I don't think I would get the cake again, but would definitely get the same entree next time.

The place is small and cozy and they had live entertainment when we were there. A guy was playing the accordion and it made the experience feel european and authentic.

The service can be a bit slow and the prices are a bit high for the type of food, which is why I took a star away. 

Overall, good experience and we will return.",2
4885,1,1550016000000,I made appointment over 1 week before my appointment and I called to confirm it and they had no record of it.  Then they rescheduled it for 1 hour later same day.  When I got there I was the second person in the waiting room. After 45 minutes of not being called the waiting room filled up. They were calling names that just showed up. I walked up to desk and they just shrugged their shoulders.  Everybody in the waiting room was getting upset.  I finally just said give me my papers backed and left..   I never saw the dentist but if you can't take customers before they see dentist how well do they take care of patients with the dentist.. I highly wouldn't recommend this dentist,3

It was all the way in a corner seemed like the restaurant we were there by chance or else we would've never seen it. Fries were excellent still hot 15 minutes later and crispy. Burger was good needed just a bit more seasoning. Nothing that I couldn't add so with a little pepper and salt it was all good. Over 7 out of 10 burger and 9 out of 10 fries. Overall I would give this place two thumbs up too bad the hotel is terrible, just old and too many kids everywhere.",2
4901,2,1550966400000,"Looks like I will add to the horrible reviews for this place.  The staff and practice as a whole is unacceptably slow.  They called my wife over an hour before her appointment regarding insurance approval.  She have then the approval number again since the approval person failed to do their job correctly the business day before.  Instead of doing their last minute call to the insurance company since my wife assured then we would be there early for her appointment, they did not call until well after we arrived.  We arrived almost 30 minutes before the scheduled appointment time.  After waiting 30 minutes after the scheduled time, we are informed that part of the delay is because of them verifying with the insurance on the phone.  We have been to 3 different companies for imaging in the last few months.  Simon Med is the only one that is not only late but continuously make their patients wait in a full waiting room.  When is corporate going to actually read these reviews and realize they need to evaluate their processes.  
Some high notes(only reason they get two stars)
1.) The front staff seemed professional.  They were not rude.
2.) The music!  They play instrumental versions of Top40 hits.  I guess the popular music in a calming tone helps sedate people while their time is being wasted by poor management.",2
4903,3,1551052800000,"I made it a point to stop here based on the many glowing reviews. Perhaps my expectations were too high as a result but I found this place utterly uninspired. The various meats were all drowning in chafing dishes and once strained were flavourless and dry. We had the Barbacoa, Pulled Pork, Chorizo, Chicken Tinga and the other chicken, the name of which escapes me now. With the exception of the Chorizo they were all bland. 

I'm a big fan of these hip reinventions of various cultural foods, but the style here seems to be trumping the substance. Dry meat, bland flavours. Grossly overrated.",2

My particular visit was just for a new scale for my bathroom but of course I didn't leave with just that! The cashier was more than helpful with assisting me to look up one of my best buy reward zone certificates! This location happens to be the closest to me which is why I visit as often as I do!

4925,2,1550188800000,"This is absolutely the BEST pool company in Phoenix. Hands down. They are honest, which we all know is a huge plus, they do exceptional work, and they are genuinely just a great group of people. 
They fixed our swamp of a pool, I kid you not. It looked like something on T.V. The pool motor was only working at partial capacity, and we tried to keep it going , but needed help. When I started looking I thought it would be easy, but a lot of places just offered cleaning services. I then saw Complete Pool Care online, and they had good reviews, had been in business since the 80's, and that says a lot right there. They were the first company and only company I ended up calling. They aren't like used car salesmen, and they didn't push. They educated us thru the entire process, and went out of their way if question or worries came up.
I will ALWAYS use them and have recommended them to others is someone asks. I feel bad for people if they choose the wrong company, because of the prices, or the headaches that come with the problems. I know there are some quality pool places in Phoenix. But I seriously doubt that they are as good as and could no way be better than Complete Pool Care. Please take my word on this. I am just lke all of you reading, Looking. When it comes to any pool service, or maintenance or anything, no need to look further. Sorry such a long review, but they are worth it.. Just call them and see for yourself.

After about an hour and a half when I was on my way home again at 9:40, 20 min away, I called again to order, the person on the phone kept hitting buttons and telling me the disruption was on my end and in between the loud beeps, asked me if I could be there by 10 because they close their doors at 10. Needless to say, I said forget it and placed my second order at one of the MANY nearby stores that keep their doors open way past 10 pm on a Friday night. And when I drove by on my way home from driving out of my way for the second time that night around 10:30 pm, all the employees were standing around talking in the parking lot.

It has 3 floors, the top of which has a treehouse feel! Fun place to go with friends and have a drink. The lines outside wrapped around the building speak to how popular it is!  Too crowded at times for my taste though.",2
5084,1,1549152000000,"I honestly cannot say anything bad about Costco. They run GREAT deals and definitely are about putting their customers on a high priority. I come to this Coscto in particular at least 2-3 times a month. I love that their fruits and vegetables are in a controlled temperature room and they are always stocking throughout the day. 

I would recommend their pound cake, cheese cake, Kirkland all beef hot dogs, pizza from the food court, and so much more! One of the things I value the most is if you take something home and you find the quality is not good, you can bring it back and they will exchange it for you for free. One time I bought strawberries that were starting to mold. I called them and told them about it and they said to bring them back in and they would give me a new pack of fruit. They do that with all of their food. Just extremely customer friendly and helpful. I was sad to learn that the food court go rid of their ice cream bar which was very popular. Hopefully they bring it back. Their pizzas are HUGE. All pizzas are 1 size which I would measure to be XXL. They can feed up to 6-7 adults. We often call ahead of time and place a order for a full pizza so that when we get to the store, the pizza is made and ready. Much better than Pizza Hut and your other typically pizza chain. Their pizzas are amazing. 


Costco is my first choice for getting tires. They typically run a Michellin deal buy 4 tires and get $70 off. 


The accept debit cards, cash and checks. They DO NOT accept credit cards unless they are American Express. 


Love this place.",2

5105,1,1549324800000,"La Mexicana is an upgraded version of the street vendors.  Good healthy food, prepared home style, this is the real deal.  

There is nothing pretentious about La Mexicana, including owner Roberto who sports a soul patch and perfect English.  The walls are decorated with memorabilia and the tables are large, solid and sturdy.  

What makes La Mexicana worth the trip is the food.  It's made fresh daily in the small kitchen.  There are 3 kinds of chili (what we gringos call salsa) 2 red and 1 verde each with a distinct flavor.  

The carne asada is is grilled, thinly cut and goes well in the ample burritos filled with rice, beans and fresh cilantro.  

The chili verde, chucks of pork in a nice tasty brown sauce are equally at home as a stand alone dish over rice with beans and salad on the side or stuffed into a burrito, enchilada or taco.  

La Mex is about as authentic as it gets.  A working persons cafe, it is always filled with locals on a break from work, holding meetings or watching the huge TV that dominates the corner playing ""futbol' or Telenovelas or the latest musical offerings live from Mexico City. 

La Mexican is a Vegas local's hidden treasure.",2

Traditional bun bo hue has pork knuckle, pork blood and beef shank, but they skip the two former and keep the latter. The broth wasn't too spicy, but you can ask for this chilli paste, which elevates the spice level by a lot if you'd like. I tried out some of my friend's oxtail fried rice, and that was delicious, ox tail meat, and an egg served however you like. I will definitely order that the next time I am in town.

It's cute and thankfully the old servers are still there. Lupe is a doll, has been here for 22 years! 

So the prices went up, my Skillet was $6.99,which is not a bad price, but I was hoping it would taste good too but it was really bland instead. There is less of a breakfast selection, gone are the old favorites. No substitutions either. Talk about corporate menu unfriendliness.

I highly recommend ordering their minced pork, Japanese fried Tofu and eggplant casserole. It is absolutely a favorite of mine. I would have it again any day. I don't know where they get the tofu but it was amazingly flavored and melted right in my mouth. I cannot emphasize how good it was and I am very hard to please.

We also got their sweet and sour soup which was agreeably balanced with maybe a touch too much vinegar.

I went again during lunch time at some point and ordered from their lunch menu. The food wasn't exactly bad but it came nothing close to the casserole. Get the casserole! 

The price was good. The portions are generous and very fair. Our waiter was very friendly and actually replaced water by tea free of charge when we asked for something hot to drink.

1) They sold me something they said would last but didn't.

5151,3,1551052800000,"We were originally going to hike Calico Tanks and changed our plans once we saw the sign pointing in the direction of Turtlehead Peak.  Mentally, I was prepared to do Calico Tanks, which is a pretty easy hike.  I had to go from leisure mode to beast-mode with the quickness.  The hike is as difficult as everyone stated in their reviews.  The first .5 miles of the hike is flat and easy.  The rest is 2 miles of torture.  You'll definitely test your physical abilities, balance, and will power as your climb to the top.  The trail is marked with a clear trail path, signs, spray paint markings, and even ribbon on branches. You'll hit a few switchbacks where you can get a little rest.  We did the hike during the middle of winter and as we got closer to the top we had another obstacle...snow and ice. The trail became very difficult to follow because of the snow.  I took advantage of the two other hikers that made it to the top before us. I used their footprints as a guide up.  We finally made it to the top and the view was worth it.  You get a full view of Red Rock Canyon, the Strip, and the Mt. Charleston area. I read a tip that you can even see Lake Mead on a clear day.  We settled at the top, took our pictures, and admired the gorgeous views.  The hike down is not easy either.  The hike up tested my endurance and cardio. The hike down tested my balance and joints. I made sure to watch every step on the way down.  As we got to the bottom, we greeted a bunch of hikers on the way up to Turtlehead Peak.  They all looked cheerful and had huge Kool Aid smiles.  Little do they know what lies ahead.  Overall, I love this hike.  I love everything about it. If you haven't done this hike before, then I suggest that you do your homework first. Be prepared for a long strenuous hike up and a great view from the top. 

TIP #1:  Bring enough hydration, duh!
TIP #2:  Bring food to fuel you. 
TIP #3:  Don't forget to sign the notebook at the top.  We forgot!!!
TIP #4:  Don't yell ""I'm the King of the world"" when you're at the top. That's so 1997.  
TIP #5:  Have fun and most importantly, be safe

If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, Ritters is the place for you!  

The PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I have eaten there a few times, but those times were really out of desperation because nothing else was open.

I am not really a huge hot dog fan, but the BEER CAVE and FRIES keep me coming back (not to mention that it is walking distance from our house). We lived in San Francisco for several years, and this place also reminds us a bit of some of our old haunts in the Mission. :)

In the summer, they open up the garage style windows, so this is a perfect spot to sit, sip beer (skip the wine though-- its not great) and work on your laptop or newspaper. If you are not into sports and just wanna chill, D's has two sides, so you don't have to feel outnumbered by screaming Steelers fans.  D's always has a nice mix of people as well- from young couples with kids, students, hipsters, to elderly folks. The staff is really nice and friendly and the large mural of local Pittsburgh celebs is pretty neat as well!

After waiting for seven minutes, I came back to discover that the barista finished his drink and hadn't even started on mine. She made mine finally, at this point I had waited over 15 minutes. I ordered a sweet drink, and it seriously was the most bitter drink I had ever had at any coffee shop. I don't even know what she made. The espresso tasted weird... So I asked her to remake it because there was no way I could drink any of it. This time I waited another 10 minutes for my drink, and I saw that she had used milk instead of almond milk like I requested. I'm allergic to milk. At this point it had been about 30 minutes since I ordered the first time and I was getting pretty damn frustrated. I asked once more if she could just remake them. I also requested a refund because of how long we were waiting. She finally finished my drinks about 45 minutes later. Get this. The manager or team lead guy came out and asked if everything was okay. We told him what happened, how it took 45 minutes to make a drink. (They weren't even busy, it was 11:30pm) and it took three times to get it right. He asked us if the drinks were fine now, and that if they were there was no refund needed. TERRIBLE customer service. Needless to say, we aren't coming back here. I don't recommend it.

I stopped in on Saturday for some lunch, and Udon noodles were just under what I would call ""meh."" First of all, the menu indicates the Udon soup will have vegetables in it. What their actually was, was one small piece of broccoli, one carrot wedge, and a whole crapdone of boring, not good onion slices. That was it.

As for the quantity of beef in my udon, I would say that it was fair, but the actual quality of the Udon, and CERTAINLY the quality of the broth sucked. 

Bottom line is, for being in Coventry, you can get better noodle soup, or just a better meal.

I WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. 

This is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. 

Keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! 

The guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. 

My favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). 

The birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go!",2

5273,3,1549843200000,"My boyfriend and I came to Montreal for a quick little get away from our kids, so we came on a budget. My bf read online somewhere that Santos is a great place for ladies night. So that's exactly what we did on our Tuesday night in Montreal. The deal was that from 6-12, you would have to order 25 dollars worth of tapas to get ""unlimited drinks"" aka ""open bar."" It said it just like that on the flyer they gave us with the rest of the drink menu. 

The ambience of the restaurant was nice, our table was really small though so we used the two chairs as tables. The music was amazing too. 

Our waiter was very kind, he spoke French and English, but more fluent in french (which maybe the reason for the language barrier at the end of the night when getting our check...)

The food was good, my bf ordered the charcuterie  board and it came with two selections of cheese, and two kinds of Italian meats, mini pickles, a few pickled veggies, onions, pistachios, candies pecans, fig spread, mustard and some fruit and bread. My only complaint would be the amount of cheese was so little. And for 25 I would expect a little more. 

I ordered three tapas (so I could get the unlimited drinks deal) first was the shrimp tapas and it kinda looked like a quesadilla garnished with guacamole and another spicy sauce. Second was the tuna tartar with rice chips. The tuna tartar was very different from what I normally taste, it was sour. It was different, but not something I would order again. Lastly was the Mexican style wings, which has a BBQ infused sauce on it. I liked the sauce and the plate came with a paint brush which was kinda cute. Over all they did a good job plating the dishes.

For drinks I ordered the Ave Maria (came with a ton of fruits) 2 Ya Man (to die for drink) and then a white sangria and a shot of tequila. My borfriend for the Potion, vodka soda water and a shot of tequila too. 

So fast forward to the end of the night, I had already ordered 25 dollars worth of tapas and we get the bill and legit, my mouth dropped to the floor when I saw the bill. It was $170 Canadian dollars. Like whaaattttt?!?! Our waiter changed me for all of my drinks despite me ordering over 25 worth of tapas. And then it dawned on me that maybe it was only for the 4 drinks that were listed on the ""ladies night -open bar - free drinks - unlimited"" flyer only? Well whatever it is, I don't think I will ever go back because of this.

Very light on the stomach. I also ordered spaghetti as well and it was good nothing spectacular tasted like spaghetti. Alexander's will now be my go to pizza place!,2

Fantastic sushi and fantastic yakatori.. fantastic specials.. tonight was seared scallop, fresh oyster, blue fin tuna roll, steamed mussels in a great broth soup... I had all plus menu items.. Everything you order here is going to be five stars. The sushi chef, yakatori chefs, and servers are all warm and hospitable and care very much about your satisfaction in their restaurant. These people take pride in what they do and it shows. I will be back. Perfect 5 out of 5 for this establishment.",1
5294,1,1549497600000,"I have a soft spot in my heart for Chicago Joes.  A stand-alone restaurant in a renovated house is a rarity here in Las Vegas - and I'd give this place two stars on that alone.  The host and staff look (and sound) like they're straight out of the Godfather with their slicked back hair, cracking jokes and being wise-guys (you may even leave with a new nick-name) - but this just adds to the homey atmosphere.  It's like you're eating at the home of an up-and-coming mobster or something.  Yeah, the place is a little worn and grubby - but I think that adds to, rather than detracts from, the experience.

Admittedly, I'm no connoisseur when it comes to Italian food - it doesn't even rank in my top 5 types of cuisine - so take my opinion for what it's worth. I like the food here.  The creamy garlic salad dressing is good - on top of a solid iceberg lettuce salad.  The Shrimp Parmigiana is tasty (isn't there supposedly a rule about cheese and shellfish?) and the Chicken Marsala fine but I still prefer Miceli's in my hometown of Hollywood.  The house chianti always seems ""hot"" to me and I always seem to end up breaking out in a sweat in this tiny place so I I try to remember to dress in layers.",1
5299,2,1549497600000,Great advice as well as great books! Tried to order a book to be delivered next day - they tried hard and then called to let me know it wouldn't happen. Great customer service!,2
5302,2,1550102400000,"I really wanted to like this place. I have heard good things about it and it is one of the only ""nice"" restaurants in the Northwest but overall I was struggling to really ""like it"". I ultimately gave it a three based upon the food as that is what I primarily consider, I would provide it a four based on decor and ambiance.

First off, I really like the wine shop and they had some good wines at decent prices. Also, the $10 corkage fee is attractive and I like that you can buy a wine right there. We sat out on the patio, this too I liked. There was live music, a saxophonist, a little loud but still nice. It was a small little alcove next to the water which provided an intimate feel. The service was prompt and pleasant as well. 

We had the steak tar-tare appetizer, this was tasty. Also, I had the French Onion soup. I love French Onion soup and this was a nice surprise, probably my favorite part of the meal, light sherry undertone and very rich. I ordered the Risotto with truffles. Risotto was too al dente for my taste and was under-seasoned. The risotto was $18. I shared this entry with my husband who ordered the Lobster Pot Pie. The pot pie was also disappointing; they would have been well served to have called it Lobster stew. There was a good amount of lobster in the ""pie"", but there should be especially in light of the hefty $40 price tag. But the flavor was lacking and it was not rich and creamy but more soupy. We had the Lobster Pot Pie at Michael Mina in SF and it was phenomenal for about the same price or possibly even less. And don't get me wrong I have no qualms with spending money on a great meal, I will gladly do so, but I still like to review each meal on it's own and by comparison with other restaurants at similar price points. 

Our other dinner companion had the duck breast. I tried a piece of his and it was very moist and had a good flavor. Overall, nice decor and food was good, but not good enough for me to come running back here when there are so many other places in LV to try and not quite sure why they made it into the 50 essential restaurant book.",2
5312,2,1550275200000,I've been in line for 40 minutes. Only 3 cars ahead of me in my lane and 3 in the other drive thru lane.  Unacceptable,1
5315,1,1549238400000,TERRIBLE! This was unfortunately the we worst pizza I have had in a long time! I am staying at the wonderful Andaz Resort across the street. I thought I would get a quick pizza and bring it back to the room. I am so disappointed. We are ordering from one of the large chains so we can fix our pizza craving now.  Sad...small...thin...pitiful pizza. You will notice that I never leave bad reviews but this time I have to. Yuck!!!!! I wasted $18 plus a $2 tip!,2

Making appointments is pointless and if ur schedule it with a particular person who knows if you are going to get them when you come in . This third time was it for me never again! Made appointment one I parked they called me and told me they can not take me if u would like to reschedule for 3rd time . Wanted to talk to Mark he was there but he was not talking to me not ever bothered after I said I wanted to talk to him . Everyone else talk to me and they did not care if I'm having a issue and that this is my third time . This place lost me as a customer  and I hope everyone know that if you have a issue pretty much they don't care to solve it . You don't even deserve one star!,1
5333,3,1550880000000,"If I could give this fine establishment 10 stars, I would. The exterior and interior cactus lights were very welcoming and cheery. The bartender/server, Susie, is one of the friendliest servers I've ever had. Great appetizers include the onion strings (they were recommended, so glad we tried them), and wings. The beer (Stella on tap!) was icy cold and fresh. Diamondbacks game was on a few flat screens, and other clientele looked comfortable and laid-back. The charming decor, cleanliness, and cozy vibe that the Cactus Tavern radiates made it extra special. Especially the ladies restroom...ladies, you HAVE to check out the restroom. This sounds weird, but it was the best bar bathroom I've had the pleasure of visiting. I left the Cactus Tavern feeling extremely satisfied with the experience and am excited for a return visit!",2

Carolyn and her staff were very helpful and accommodating especially to the wedding couple. They made sure that this event was easy and stress-free for the bride especially. 

 I highly recommend this place, not only I had a great positive experience, but also knowing that Victoria Chapel and it's staff made this special event a memorable experience that Elenor and Bong will never forget in their lives. After all, at the end of the day, it's really the wedding couple's opinion that really matters.",2

I figured that they must sell Polaroid cameras, but I did not spot any for sale.  Maybe there were some in their museum.  The Polaroid museum is located on the second floor, and it costs $5 to check it out (which I did not do).

I did not check out the store too much either.  Did notice that they had plenty of computer stations set up around the store.  I believe you can have your pictures printed here for those special memories.  They have a couple of large picture frames set up where people can have their pictures taken.  Of course, we made sure to have our photos taken there as well.

Cool place to check out.  It was a good break from the hot temperatures outside.",2

Their ginger salad dressing was one of the better dressings we have had as was the fried rice.  They used lots of eggs in the rice which I like.  

Hibachi filet was a bit salty for my taste but cooked perfectly otherwise.  A decent sushi option in the eastern suburbs.",2

For $15, it's definitely not worth at all to be honest. I wasnt close to being full.. I don't recommend. You have to order at the cash register so there wasnt much service either, I thought it was a restaurant at first. There are lot of employees but they don't look like they are doing much.",2

Today, success!!  An early meeting had me driving by and the OPEN sign was on. I quickly pulled over and went in to discover trays and trays of donuts!  I ordered a chocolate frosted French cruller, chocolate frosted cake donut, and a cinnamon sugar cake donut. They were all delicious but the cinnamon sugar was hands down AMAZING and YUMMY.

My double bacon cheese burger with everything was fantastic. The free peanuts and fancy drink machine really put the experience over the top. The location was also very clean.

5387,2,1549152000000,"Why haven't more people reviewed this place?  Is it because it's a mixture of two things we are taught to be bad for us at different ages?  Is it because the building looks ominous as you walk towards it.  Or is it because people are too lazy to discover this place?  Whatever the reason, shame people, shame.

I've never really paid attention while I was in here much, except for today.  As I looked around my eyes widened.  I was...a kid in a candy store!  Literally.  Candy, candy everywhere.  Candy that will take you back to your childhood and maybe even further than that.  I definitely practiced good self control in here, or else I would have been broke by the time I walked out the door.

Yes, I admit, I also ventured back to the ""adult"" section.  Selection is vast.  Prices are some of the best, even better than the local corner market or gas station.  Staff were rather fun to deal with.  Joking and talking in there raspy voices.  I'll definitely know I will be stopping back in here when I'm in the area.",1

I am glad I did! We had already received a quote from a well-known moving company that I thought was a little too high. Jones Moving gave me a reasonable price without any hidden charges at all. They were upfront about the cost and also the payment method. The three movers that showed up were polite, efficient and accommodating. They showed up on time, loaded up our house in decent time, were careful with our items and with our homes, and they placed the furniture exactly where we needed it in the new home.

More facts:
I scoured Yelp and the Internet for a florist in North York to order a prom corsage for a lovely lady. She wanted white to complement her golden gown. 
Apricot Florists had only 1 review and it was 5 stars. The reviewer mentioned the owner's previous affiliation with Pusateri's. A quick preview of Apricot's beautiful website and I was half-sold. Such gorgeous floral arrangements that married colour, shape and texture! I had the urge to run out and obtain a bunch of flowers toute de suite! 

The next day, we went to pick up the order and it was beautiful. Freesias and roses with a satin ribbon. $35.

Kathy, the proprietress, greeted us. She has a degree in Fine Art from the University of Quebec in Montreal and further training from Metiers de l'horticulture de Montreal. No wonder her creations are très chic with a flair oriental! 

We had a little trouble finding the shop which is located off of Mt Pleasant, on Manor Rd. If you are lucky, you will find parking on the pavement in front of the shop. Then, before or after your visit to Apricot, you can make a quick stop at Jules Patisserie around the corner.",1

I read some reviews that said no one was there to help them, but that wasn't our case.  We went on a weekend and it wasn't very busy.  There were lots of people walking around asking us if we needed any help.  As soon as they told me it was only $1 for a photo, I started going through all of my photos.  Yes you have to buy six, but that was no problem to find six pictures that I wanted to print.  In fact, it was hard to limit myself.

The spa itself is tucked in the little plaza off Maiden Lane, right across the RBC building. The interior is well decorated, and surprisingly spacious. 

At the beginning of the appointment, Monique did not leave the room as I changed, which struck me as a bit odd, but for me, this isn't a big deal. Monique uses soft wax and strips; my past experience with this method has been less than pleasant, but Monique's technique is very good, and did not hurt nearly as much as I thought it would. She waxes small areas at a time to minimize pain, but finished in a mere 10 minutes. She also gave me some soothing lotion. 

When I went home, I did notice a few stray hairs; however, I have grown to understand this as my hair is very coarse and does not pull out easily.

Came early on a Friday with the hubby and shared 3 plates (lamb meatballs, duck flatbread and 1717 hot wings) and we each had our choice of beer. The food was so good!  
Everything came hot out of the kitchen. Meatballs were sizzling with gooey ricotta melting nicely over the 3 large meatballs. Wings were large (4 whole wings) and flatbread was plenty.  I did not find the portions to be too small in relation to the price. The quality of the food was great.  Flavors were intense. We like to eat and we left nicely stuffed.  I plan on returning soon.

This place is a fantastic mom-and-pop place owned by a great couple that care about their food and their customers. The waitstaff is attentive and friendly. If you're not familiar with Vietnamese food, this is a great introduction as there are ""easy"" things on the menu and they serve beer and wine. For those of you that are used to eating pho and weirder things, these guys add extra tendon for me at no extra cost, which makes me drool with happiness!! 

Pho is a little pricey for the valley at about $10 for the combo bowl. I am happy to pay though for the convenience, the quality, and the ambience of the restaurant. The place is clean and comfortable, the ingredients are fresh, the food tastes great!",2

It was a beautiful experience. It's a 13 miles scenic loop and there's plenty of designated stops where you can pull over and have a look around and/or hike. There's endless hiking trails there so it's like a new experience every time you visit!",1

This was one of the most perfect examples of this dish I've had.  Even ones I had in Japan weren't this good.  It is a super simple thing, but some real skill to do it right.  We also had the Hamachi Kama, which was excellent as well.  A large one at that!  Very succulent and yummy.  We finished things off with the grilled eel.  Again very good, but in this case I have had better.  But still an excellent example of this dish.  

A good selection of saki at decent prices is another plus.  And excellent service.  I would so become a regular if this was down the street from me.  The only bummer is the day we were there they didn't have any sushi as the sushi chef was out a reception or something.  Which made me sad but give me a reason to come back to Montreal soon and try this place again.

Remember, Grilled Mackerel!",2

I was heading to Sam's Club and spotted what I thought was a typo on their temporary restaurant banner but when I looked again and saw, ""Asian Soul Food,"" below, I had to quickly make a u-turn to find out what in the devil was this. I know a lot of Chinese joints have fried chicken wings on their menus but that's hardly soul food. I'm so glad I went there because the owner was very welcoming and super friendly but the food was out of sight. I'm still bewildered on the flavor profile that tastes better than many Chinese places I've been. I was ear hustling a lot of repeat customers in there singing its praises on almost everything Asian.  I got the combination fried rice which comprises of chicken, shrimp and beef, (I think or pork) and all I can say is that I was totally shocked with the texture and consistency and how it resembled our Asian brothers and sisters and not Big Mama. They do not put peas and carrots in their rice only egg, onions, scallions and bean sprouts.  I was trying to peek in the back to see if I saw a lil Asian person there but nope, there were sistas throwing down like that.  They even have a touch of Asian and Soul in one of their specials called, ""Bruce Leroy."" I chuckled when I saw that.  Anyway, I'm planning on revisiting before leaving to try the dishes repeat customers bragged about: egg foo young, egg rolls, tamales and of course that fried rice.  I'd suggest if any of you are in Vegas, please make this a go to. Oh and that banana pudding looks delish! Didn't try it but I might.",2

This is definitely not their best location. They close all their lanes early and if you're in a bit before close be prepared to be harassed about leaving on time and then have to wait in line for 20 min after close because they're not prepared for people leaving at once. Seem to find a lot of products that were expiring or have already expired so definitely double check the date. A box of crackers I bought expired 4 months ago. The bonus of that is you can find some 30% of stickers on a lot of soon to expire meat and pre-checked lettuce. Staff is not helpful and not friendly either.,2

This place is not those dingy ghetto places where the massage chairs are falling apart. Everything is state of the art. I passed out on those chairs only to wake up to some beautiful a$$ feet. The service was amazing and by service I mean their technique. The mini foot massage was heavenly. I feel a shame of myself that someone else cares more about my feet than me.  The customer service was also beyond words. I was treated like a king in place made for a queen but I paid peasant prices. And fellas there was a lot of hot a$$ girls here.

We had no trouble finding a booth by the window to enjoy each other's company.  The food was great!  Being a vegetarian, I ordered the veggie burger and was not disappointed.  However, I requested blue cheese crumbles because I don't like goat cheese.  I was quickly informed they do not carry blue cheese (GASP).  It's like a staple of every kitchen serving burgers.  What!!?   I assumed my overreaction would cause them to reconsider adding the item on their menu.  Coming back a second time, we had burgers (mine being veggie again) and like the first time it was super delish.  I think they must put crack in their fries because I can't stop eating them.  Welp, still no blue cheese.  Grrrrrr.   Ok, so surely a third visit would do the trick.  Nope.  I came back with a large group of friends this time.  Still no dang blue cheese.  I'm going to have to BYOBC (bring your own blue cheese) next time.  So frustrating.  Anyway, my only critique beyond the blue cheese is that they only give you tiny cups with ketchup in them.  You have to order tons of cups to get enough ketchup for your fries.  Their Bloody Mary is good (not great... it could be spicier).  They plenty of seating and lots of great outdoor space.  I highly recommend coming here to hang out and eat.  However, be warned that they don't have blue cheese.   Hahaha.  Enjoy!",3

Greeted/seated immediately. Server appeared quickly for my drink order. Friendly. No attitude that I have sometimes read about.

Ordered a Morty's Steakburger. Took a while to receive it. First impression was exciting. Little messy to eat... maybe that is why they brought extra napkins. Very good burger cooked just as requested: pink center. Sticky fingers were justified by the delicious bun full of goodies.

This is not something you shovel down in a couple of minutes. You eat it slowly and enjoy each bite.

While there are a few nuisances like some of the tables being too close together for my taste and the fact that the bar has no TV, which I like when I'm alone, the food still wins out in the end and brings me back.

On this trip I discovered a new favorite that I absolutely will find the recipes for....the chicken taco's.  Delicious rub on the skewers of grilled chicken, grilled achiote, fresh cilantro, and a peanut-barbecue sauce that simply makes it all sing.  Paired with a fresh-tasting Mesa Grill margarita on the rocks caused only one regret that I will remedy next time.  A double order and 2 margaritas.

I had the seafood paella along with two appetizers and dessert.  My share came out to be $49 including tax and tip.  The paella was huge (it actually lasted for four extra meals without going bad).  The spicy chorizo was somewhat too much for an appetizer.  The flan was moist and good.

The setting is certainly very interesting. The restaurant has clearly been there for a while and enjoyed a great reputation. Unfortunately, that evening it didn't live up to that reputation.

I'm a big steak guy, and my fiancee enjoys a cut every now and then as well. I ordered the dry aged ribeye and she had the filet mignon. The filet mignon arrived and had the texture of pate, no joke, it was very dry and tasted awful.. to the point where it put me off my ribeye after I tried it. The ribeye was a slightly better but no better than something you can get at an Outback steakhouse. There was no flavor and the meat was very stringy, not a good cut.

Went back couple of times to make sure but I can no longer reccommend their rolls as the go to sushi even their famous las vegas roll. There just wasnt enough taste for the price. As for their yakisoba, there was a lot less ingredients than before - might as well boil plain noodle with food dye and sprinkle a packet of microwaveable vegetables....yes it was that bare.

I've always thought of this mall as just below Scottsdale, but without all the silicone and snobbery.  We went last weekend to kill some time and were a little surprised to see that it was overrun with screaming toddlers.  I guess I should have known that when the AZ temperatures tip past 100 degrees, we have nothing better to do then hang out inside air conditioned malls or hang out inside air conditioned movie theatres, take your pick.

It was a BLAST! Even my boyfriend and his friend loved it! It's a great comedy show with singing and dancing and of course beautiful woman barely dressed who look like zombies. 
We laughed the whole show! The first thing my boyfriend said after was ""next time we go to Vegas we are seeing this again!"" 
Before the show you have the option to buy drinks while you are waiting to enter the theatre. Me and my friend got a Strawberry Daquiri/Pina Colada drink, which tasted delicious! The guys got beer, which they had a decent selection of. 
The inside isn't very nice but I feel like it adds more to the show (wooden floors, benches etc...) - only negative is the seating, if someone has to use the rest room or they get called on stage they practically have to climb over everyone, which is what happened to our row... Someone got picked to be on stage and had to climb over us, and while doing so knocked over someone's full beer. 
The show is very crowd interactive and during a tiny intermission you get free jello shots!

Note #2: Ritters is a 24/7/365 restaurant that offers its entire menu from breakfast to lunch to dinner all day and all night every single day. And man, did we have a blast with this! Keep readin', pilgrim...

I am not a lush of any kind, and this past Friday morning, I unsuspectingly fell madly in love with Ritters Diner. 

We had thought of going to Ritters during the graveyard shift one weekend, but being that the establishment reportedly attracts Pittsburgh's young, intoxicated, and obnoxious during that time and that I have little patience for such humanoids, that plan was nixed. However, on a frosted, lightless payday Friday morn, Kay was waiting on a background check before she could start her new job, and I needed sustenance before work. When we both awoke earlier than expected, Ritters immediately came to mind, and suddenly, it was Bloomfield or bust!

I enjoy a wholesome, solid, mountain-man breakfast sans bells, whistles, and rainbow jimmies as much as any other blue-collar bloke, but when burgers and fried chicken can be had at 6:30 AM, omelets and pancakes become too drab and obvious. Besides, I'm also an Aquarian, and when put into boxes, we tend to think our way out of 'em.

And the Pittsburgh City Paper said that Sousa's main gentrification vehicle Salt of the Earth ""blurs distinctions."" Heh. 

Enter the beast known as The Pitts-burger. Centered 'round a thick, bleeding medium-rare patty, this Goliath of ground beef included BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, grilled onions, bacon, and a fried egg. One of THE essential burgers encountered during my dining lifetime, it dripped, oozed, kissed, stung, and occupied that roaring void in my stomach like few have. The bun was toasted and was not without a hint of butter. The Pitts-burger may strangle your heart, but it will do it so, so softly. 

The french fries were burning majestic scepters of yellow, mashed potato chip glory.

Kay's fried chicken smacked of honey, crackling when our teeth punctured the  homemade batter to reveal sultry poultry inside. Our lovingly irreverent and streetwise server told us that Ritters sells more clucker parts than the nearby KFC does, and I want to believe her. The Colonel's mass-produced swill deserves to be outclassed. 

Our desserts were Chocolate Cream Pie and Strawberry Shortcake. The Chocolate Cream Pie should be renamed the Chocolate Dream Pie for its velvety, otherworldly pudding filling, it's flagrantly flaky crust, and its sweetness-cutting whipped cream garnish. The Strawberry Shortcake was akin to slices of golden shortbread mortared together by preserves and topped with a gilded white buttercream. 

To us, there was nothing dingy about Ritters. Jukeboxes lined the perimeter of the dining room and abstract sculptures of labyrinthine iron jutted from sides of the booths. Burly, middle-aged men in work clothes patronized the diner instead of immature partygoers. Some are making Ritters out to be a ""last chance"" sort of place that they seem to want to like less than they do, giving out backhanded kudos to it as if it were a dirty old strip club that amused them and nothing more. When I looked around Ritters and relished its classic, economical cuisine, I saw, tasted, and felt nothing but timelessness, integrity, and an affectionate mindfulness of quality.  

I don't know how many years Ritters Diner has been in operation, but I do know that I'd hate to see it uprooted by renewal and replaced with something that is exploitative of indigenous food such as Thai fusion or whatever else the privileged have co-opted this week.

Forgo the East End's glitter and skitter o'er to Ritters for some food that will leave ya the opposite of...bitter.",2
5854,1,1551225600000,"I got up one morning for work at 7 and decided I couldn't go in without seeing a doctor first.  I hardly get sick, so I didn't have a family doctor to go to, so I did a search through my insurance's directory, but I couldn't find anybody open.  When I finally did find somebody, their office was appointment only and was booked for 3 days.  Finally I gave up on the directory and googled to find PMC, and they accepted walk-ins and my insurance (I wished I did that at 7 because they're actually open at 7).  The nurses were friendly and great to work with.  They quickly diagnosed me, I saw the doctor (or NP), and I was out on my way in about 30 minutes.  
I tried to go back to work, but HR wouldn't let me without clearance from the doctor's office, so the receptionist had to write up a couple different doctor's notes since they weren't specific enough (which didn't matter since I ultimately wasn't allowed in the office).  They were very accommodating with all of these requests from HR.
Finally, they have great hours.  They're open early, they're open late, and they're open on weekends.  They also accept walk-ins, so I know they'll be there whenever I need a last minute visit to a doctor.",1
5868,2,1549152000000,I would like to be able to write a review about the service at this Mercedes dealership but I can't seem to get an appointment. I called and spoke to the receptionist and ask for the service department yesterday. I was told that all service writers were busy but that a note would be passed and as soon as one became available they would call me back. After waiting an hour and a half I decided maybe they got my phone number wrong so I called back again. This time I was connected to a service representative. I told him my problem and my name and told him that my Mercedes was in his computer. He said that he was busy with another customer and he would call me back as soon as he was available. Two and a half hours later it was 6 p.m. and I know they were closed for the day. It's now 2:30 the next day and I still haven't heard from them. Although I didn't buy my Mercedes from this dealership I would expect that they would honor all service requirements. I'm really disappointed in their customer service. I hope someone from customer relations reads this and acts accordingly.,2

Stars for big portions and nice service. 

Minus stars for sloooow service. 

We ordered choco chip pancakes -- which by the way was PHENOMENAL and we couldn't even finish half of it. 3 cakes full of chocolate. 

We also had the croissant French toast and oh. Em. Geeeee. If you have a huge sweet tooth and can handle the sugary goodness.. then it's what should be in front of you soon. It's so buttery and full of flavor! I'm sure syrup wasn't even needed but hey.. go big or go home right? 

Their bacon is thick cut and so good!

This location is definitely more orderly and organized than the location on King.  I was greeted upon entering and asked if I needed assistance which was a nice surprise compared to the other location.

I was able to move freely around the store and just browse at my leisure.  I wasn't looking for anything in particular, but always like to check out the clearance section just in case of a good sale.

Some parts of the store looked a bit sparse because of lack of merchandise which is quite the contrast to the other location as it's just jammed packed with everything. Nevertheless, they do have good selections of  outdoors equipment, clothing and accesories that one would need.  Plus they have a bike maintenance area which seems to be popular at this location.

Looks like a decent outdoorsy store to me.",2

5879,1,1550793600000,"I am not a fan of this location. I'd rate the location at Town Square at about a four after many visits, but my visits to this location have amounted to a two star. Maybe I'm in the minority here because their parking lot is jam packed every time I drive by here. 

I'm thinking the appeal may be strictly related to alcohol and TV. The food I've had here just hasn't been good, mediocre at best. I wouldn't say the food on the standard menu is expensive, but it's overpriced for the quality. 

On one of my visits I came here for Happy Hour with coworkers and the food for that was acceptable, but not great. It was cheap at least.

Then I realized they had gave me the wrong sandwich as well, I asked for the spicy chicken deluxe.

5882,2,1551139200000,"The other reviews are all true. Food is great, but service is one of the worst. We walked in and felt unwanted and ignored. Finally got addressed and seated and didn't have our waitress come back to attend to us for a LONG while, even though she walked past plenty of times. We tried to grab her but were unsuccessful. She eventually came around and we ordered drinks & food together (since we waited so long). When the food came out we still didn't have our drinks. She said the bartender was slammed but it felt like the waitress just forgot to pick them up. That stunk cause we had to sit around after dinner for a while trying to finish our drinks vs enjoying them during the long wait. Some food details were wrong-she blamed the kitchen not herself. 

Bottom line: food good, skinny margarita delish. However, you can get that elsewhere with genuine service and an establishment that's excited to have you as a patron! This is Hudson, they need to get it together cause it's a prime location in the heart of the area!",2

5895,2,1550793600000,"The worst! We should have been tipped off when we drove into the parking lot and the dumpster receptacle was running over and the doors not closed from customer view. Very telling that management just does not care.

We entered the restaurant (around 3pm) and was greeted by a young man who walked around the hostess stand and stood behind 2 women who were going over paperwork or schedules or something having nothing to do with the customer. The one women held up a finger and continued to ignore us. As we stood in front of the stand about 2 feet away, I swear to god a server walked right between us and the hostess stand. So close that we had to step back. And she giggled. I said to my husband loud enough for all three to hear me that if we were not seated in the next minuet we needed to leave. NOTHING. We turned around and left. No we are sorry or have a nice day NOTHING.

5911,2,1551139200000,"Great restaurant & great food.

When you walk in your immediately greeted by a host(s) and there's a choice of sitting at the bar or table service.

I chose the bar and Scott was my host.

The whole restaurant has a nice vibe to it, I love the idea of playing vinyl records to give a nice nostalgic feel. 

In the next room over is a huge wine display room, so for those of you who love wine may want to check this joint out.

The menu selection is simple & all small plates. If you're like me & travel alone, this is great portion wise so the meal is a la cart and perfect for one person.

The Mac and cheese is amazing! It's creamy with little crunchy it of croutons to give it a bit of contrast and texture.

The best thing was the pork belly. 

My first bite reminded of that scene in Ratatouille where the food critic takes a bite and is immediately transcended to a younger period where he was a child and experienced that same first bite.

That's how I felt when I had the pork belly. The blend of flavors took me back to a memory of growing up where I had those exact flavors.

To end it all up, I had the butterscotch cream dessert. Almost like a brûlée where the hard sugar is in the form of a toffee/brittle style cookie.

Such an amazing place & if I'm ever back in town, I hope to relive the experience.

Enjoy!

Service has been OK. The wait time has never been quick, but I've also never become irritated by the wait... maybe 30 minutes or so.

5925,1,1550361600000,"Toronto seems to have a pretty big Ramen scene, and this place seems to be one of the top places to go to. I first tried the Tonkatsu black and found it overwhelmingly garlicky. The Tonkatsu flavor was rich and sweet and balanced over time but in the end could not stand up to the black garlic oil. I normally like my Tonkatsu ramen with more of a punch, as this was more creamy than the usual hearty Tonkatsu I'm used to.  I opted for the thin noodles and did not found them to have the kansui-wrought springiness I was expecting. 

The Shio ramen on the other hand was amazingly delicious and even more umami-esque than the Tonkatsu, which is strange to me as Tonkatsu is my usual go -to ramen type. This time I got the thick noodles which is more to my liking. Had I not tried the Shio ramen I would not really reviewed this place, but since I don't live in Toronto and don't know what the competition is like I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt since the Shio ramen was awesome, the service is good, and the appetizers are good too.

5942,1,1549670400000,"My husband and I got married in Vegas 9/29/12, and though our wedding was not at the Plaza, we decided that we would reserve a block of rooms for our guests here, as well as book a mini suite for ourselves. Let me start by saying the casino, lobby, and rooms were all very nice. I had never stayed at the Plaza prior to this, I don't think I have ever even been inside, but I had heard that they just did the renovation, and heard it was nice, so we went with it. I couldn't decide to give the Plaza 4 stars or 3 stars, based solely on the group reservation department, which is where the hotel missed the 5 star mark for me. Even the rude girl at the check in desk wouldn't have made this hotel lose a star, as I didn't personally experience her, however SEVERAL of my guests did. I felt that the customer service from the group sales department left much to be desired. They didn't get back to me, didn't answer questions - I asked the same question to 2 girls that work there, and after 5 days of no response back from either one, I finally called the manager, and all of a sudden one of the girls called me back within an hour of me leaving the message for the manager, however I still wish the manager would have contacted me back, as I was pretty much done dealing with the girls at that point. I also was pretty surprised to find out that a block of rooms can mean anywhere in the hotel, which sucked that some of our guests were in north tower, some in south tower, and everyone was on different floors from one another. I thought the whole reason we booked it all so far in advance was to have a block of rooms together, at least in the same tower if it couldn't be on the same floor. The lobby of the hotel was really nice, the mcdonalds is open 24 hours, which is nice, the hash house a go go was really really good - we tried to go Saturday morning, but there was over an hour wait, so we ended up going Monday morning, and it wasn't even crowded at all. My parents stayed at the Golden Nugget, and when my dad came over to our room, he was impressed by how big and nice it was. The mini suite had a mini bar, and it was nice to have the fridge in the room. Also, when you book a group reservation, the resort fee is waived, so we were able to access the internet and stuff for no extra charge. I didn't use the parking garage that everyone complains about in other reviews, the south tower is right by the valet, so we used the valet service our entire stay. I also like that they have a security guard stationed at the base of each tower, and you have to show a room key to access the elevators. Overall, I would say our stay was great, we had a great time, and I felt the rooms were pretty nice. Also, there is a lounge called the drink, and we hung out there one night, it was pretty fun, shots for 25 cents every hour on the hour. Only other negative thing was that we brought a babysitter for the wedding night, and when they checked out, they left my kids shoes in the room, when we went to lost and found, they hadn't processed everything that was left over the weekend, and told me to call back the following day. My husbands mom, sister, and aunt also forgot all the clothes hanging in the closet, which included what they wore to our wedding, and lost and found didn't have those items or my kids shoes - so that was kind of disappointing to lose all those items. Oh yeah, we also got a pizza from pop up pizza, and it was really good. My husband wanted to order another one for the road before we left, lol. Also, we went to exposed salon (already reviewed them on yelp) and got our hair and make up done prior to the wedding, and I would recommend those girls to everyone, they did a fantastic job. I decided to go with 4 stars, the plaza really did a great job, and though I would never book a group there again, my husband and I may consider a stay there in the future",2

I came by a few times during my time in Montreal, and enjoyed my coffee in a sunny spot by the window. I like that their coffee is locally roasted, but it didn't blow my mind or anything.

Sticking with this Asian stereotype, I've done all sorts of outrageous things to my hair, like grown it out emo-style, bleached it, highlighted it, shaved it. I probably take after my japanese mother who dyes her hair every other month. Needless to say, I won't have any hair in 10 years. 

In the meantime, I have become a devoted customer of this particular salon for several reasons:

1) I've met some awesome people who work there: SHOUT OUT TO JOANNA ^^, MEGAN, CHLOEY (spelling?), LAUREN, AND ELIZABETH

2) Megan cuts my hair perfectly in spite of the fact that it grows out funny

3) The shampoos smell and feel better here. I'm comparing this with 22 years of getting my haircut done across the world

4) I work right next door :)

Given that I'm male, I can't comment on any of the women's cuts or styles, but I imagine they're also pretty amazing because everyone here obviously knows what they're doing ^^

He arrived on time, often early, every time he was scheduled to come out. He was professional yet personable. He is an expert but he explained everything so we understood. Also, he is amazing at repairing drywall. No one wants to deal with mold but if you think you might have it, call Moldex.",1

5978,2,1549584000000,"Enjoyed a family vacation. Great accommodations. Room was comfortable with adequate space, a desk, table and couch. View from the 11th floor was ok.... in the distance. Restaurants were enjoyable and the on-site bowling alley was lots of fun. Pool area was enjoyable too. 
Customer service by housekeeping was phenomenal. About half way home I realized I'd forgotten to clean out the dresser, leaving clothes and my new watch behind. A couple of calls and an easy online form and 2 days later a package with all our stuff arrived at our house. Thank you!!!!!

It was hard to stop myself from grabbing everything.  I snagged a roll that had tuna tartare as a topping and it was delicious.  I also got seaweed salad and this was actually the only thing I didn't like at this place. It was really oily and lacking flavor (I've never had bad seaweed salad until I ate it here). I ordered some fried calamari and it was very good. They throw in the little squid tentacles, which are my favorite! We also ordered a few spicy tuna hand rolls, which were perfect with crisp nori and yummy tuna spilling out.  The main entree was a sashimi platter and the fish was super fresh and delicious (see picture and you will see what I'm talking about).  The service was exceptional. We will definitely return again!",2
5981,1,1551312000000,"Pretty good. A nice change of pace but not extraordinary. Food was mildly spiced, a little boring, could have used more zing and complexity. Best was the crawfish pie, sort of a turnover stuffed with crab cake-like mixture. Afraid it might have been pre-frozen? The big problem is if you've ever had the real thing in Cajun country this place was a poor second. Nonetheless it's a good try and something fun if you're looking for a change. Just not overwhelming. Service was very good, BTW.",2

The layers and flavors are perfect together! We also got chicken tacos, carne asada tacos and tortilla soup (watch out, it has got a kick!). Everything was very tasty and the service was FANTASTIC!! A big Thank you to Sierra on day 1 and to Popeck (Pretty sure that is what the ticket said) on day 2! We will be back! Great job to the servers, bartender - excellent Margaritas and Bloody Marys! And to the Kitchen Staff - this is the kind of food folks dream about! I am a big fan of nachos with melted, shredded cheese, NOT cheese sauce! You nailed it! Thank you!",2

6011,2,1549065600000,"We didnt get to sit in the treehouse, but we were nearby about two tables away.

This was on my  Bookmark before I even touched foot in LV, and only reserved here because we stayed another night and needed a destination. I was hesitant because I've seen postcard-type ads for this place at CES, and I believe that places that need to advertise aren't the best. Opentable also promoted it with extra points.

Anyways, OpenTable showed same day availability for party of 5, so I booked it anyways, no cost booking and I could cancel if I found a better place.

We were seated promptly at the reservation time, no need for a lengthy wait like the previous restaurants this past week. Mastro's wasnt that busy when we arrived, although it did once 8:30p rolled around.

We ordered our entrees and sides. However I did not know the entrees come as that, with the sides making the dish. What I also didn't know was the production involved once dinner arrived....

The production went as follows, you get one or two servers serving the entrees, then a supporting team of servers go around putting sides on your entree plate. I believe we had six servers, in a high paced whirlwind headturning array of food being served onto our plates.

The $37 lobster mash potato was alright, but having a similar $15 smaller portion lobster mash at N9NE the previous night, I would skip Mastro's and go for N9NE's.

I would skip the Au Gratin Potato, it was nothing more than potato with cheese melted on top, not what I expected.

Creamed spinach was good. 

Yes, the booze is marked up.

All told, of the three dinners I had in LV, this ranked third.",2

6036,1,1549411200000,"Red Rock Canyon is an amazing state park to check out.  It's a 45 min west of Vegas and it's a hidden gym that will lead you to a spectacular mother nature.  Red rock has a lot to offer which is great for beginners to expert hikers.   I have seen ppl from many ages and dogs are allowed too.  There is a $7 entrance fee that will lead you to over 15 different hikes along a 13 mile loop drive.   I would recommend driving around the loop before deciding on the hiking trail.  Hiking trails can range from 45 mins to 3.5 hours round trip and from easy to strenuous.  Trails can range from 0.70 mile to 3 miles around trip.  You can spend a whole day while the sun is up and then head back to vegas to enjoy the night life.  Don't forget to bring plenty of water, snacks, sunblock, sunglasses, and a camera.  

My favorite is hanging around the red rock canyon.  I highly recommend the Calico Trail I, Calico Trail II, and Calico Tank Trail which run along the red rock canyon.  Calico Trail I is more flat area of the canyon which is an easy hike.  But it was closed due to construction for parking and the pavement.   Calico Trail II is a 1-2 hours hike down into the red canyon.  I would rate this hike more easy-moderate.  Its requires less climbing compared to Calico Tank.   Calico Tank is a moderate hike that requires a lot of climbing of the red rocks.  It's quite fun if you are adventurous and ready to get down and use all 4 limbs.   This is a 3.5-4 hour hike depending on your experience level.",2

6059,3,1551225600000,"I purchased a package of 10 spray-tans through Groupon on December 13, 2011.  I was very excited because I have been to other Hollywood Tans locations in the past and been pleased with the experience.  

On my first visit, I attempted to present the Groupon using the Groupon app on my iPhone.  I was rudely told me that the phone screen would not suffice and that I would have to print the coupon and physically present it to them.  

I returned the next morning with the printed copy in hand.  The desk attendant took the paper and entered my information into the computer.  She then told me that I would have to pay an additional $4 for the spray tan cartridge.  This additional fee was not disclosed anywhere in the Groupon deal write-up and increased the cost of each tan by 58%.  I was disappointed, to say the least.

I know that Groupon catches a lot of flack for situations like these, but really it is the fault of the individual businesses.  They clearly used deceptive advertising to rope people in on the Groupon deal and surprise them with the additional costs.  

Between the snobby, crispy desk attendant I interacted with the first night and the deceptive advertising, this experience has left a seriously bad taste in my mouth.  I have asked Groupon for a refund and I will not be returning to the Shadyside Hollywood Tans.",2

I have come here before a couple of times, and have always enjoyed my food and the pomp and circumstance.  I had however, never brought a child with me.  Now that I have a grandson, we do take him everywhere and expose him to as much as we can.  (it's what I did with my kids too).  I really didn't think it was going to be an issue.  We made reservations early, we were there at opening.  The hostess was happy and very accommodating.  She asked if he was allowed to color, and I said yes, but he doesn't understand the concept of paper and would draw on your tablecloth.  She responded with that is quite alright.  We don't do the laundry ourselves, anyways.  I thought WOW, they are really accommodating.  

She brought my grandson, the crayons and the paper.  We had been introduced to our server, I believe a Mrs. Bender.  She was all business and IMMEDIATELY corrected my grandson for drawing on the tablecloth and took away his crayons.  With a tisk tisk.  Between her and another server, there was a lot of eye rolling going on.  They were not happy that a child was at THEIR table.  I was very offended by all this, but because we were someone else's guest and I didn't want to upset her, I stayed quiet.

Lawry's you get a ZERO for service this night.  You have no patience for your younger guests.  Your food was good, but with the competition you have in Vegas now, I won't be rushing to your doorstep anytime soon.",3

Guests who had arrived and were seated 5-10 min after we ordered, received their meals before we did. That could have been overlooked but the service we received was absolutely awful. It seemed like a battle to get more water while we were waiting for our food. The bartender filled up our waters half way and then never returned to fill them back up. It's hot outside and water should be the one thing that never stays empty at a table. Overall the food was decent but the service is what will keep us away.",2

I came with a friend on Monday night and we split a small fries, a wild boar sausage and a kangaroo sausage. No currywurst since she hates curry.

I loved the kangaroo sausage. The rosemary was a bit overpowering, but it was very flavourful and juicy. She liked the wild boar better since it had more of that sausagy bite, but I found it a bit dry and heavy on the cilantro. It was still delicious, though. The buns that housed the sausages were incredible. Crispy and buttery on the outside, soft on the inside. The fries were pretty good, and I really liked the chive mayo that came with it.

I also really liked the atmosphere. It was pretty dead there the night we went, so we had almost the whole place to ourselves. I really liked the seating and the lighting. It felt like we were somewhere else.

I found the menu and choices a bit confusing since i'd never been there before, but the person at the counter was a huge help. The self-serve water was a nice touch, too.

Well let me tell you, he brought his A game and certainly OVER delivered on my expectations.  Not only was the dance floor packed all night, I received so many compliments praising how good he was and wanting him to DJ at all my friends upcoming weddings.  Mike was not only an amazing DJ, he was also very attentive and caring to my needs that day.  On several occasions he took the time out of what he was doing to make sure that my day was going smoothly and if there was anything he could do for me.

I am not super tempted by the snacks, but if you can find the urge to splurge, peanut butter cookies look great, as do the squares/bars- 7 layer and caramel cheesecake.  
The terrace is often packed when the sun hits it just right in the spring-fall season. In the winter, sneak upstairs to the Juliette balcony to look over all the patrons, or sit on one of the ultra-cozy chairs and just read about the upcoming art exhibitions. The art on the walls rotates and is for sale. They also do weddings! I can just imagine a cocktail reception with freshly made cappuccino bar! Yum!",2

6214,1,1551052800000,Came across this diner when meeting a friend for breakfast. Absolutely surprised on how good the service was. Seems good service is on the decline in Vegas but this place was top notch. My coffee cup was never empty and our server (unfortunately I don't remember her name) was so sweet and attentive. Everyone at the restaurant was very pleasant. The food portions are huge. I got the basic egg breakfast and everything was delicious. I highly recommend.,2
6220,3,1549152000000,"Like most people who have visited Charbar I was really impressed by the room. Beautifully decorated,  definitely one of the more esthetically pleasing restaurants in the city. The view from the patio is also gorgeous. 

As with most new restaurants it needs to iron out a few wrinkles. There's a sign near the entrance that  says the main floor hostess will help seat you for the patio so we checked in with them. After about a five minute wait (a headscratcher because there were plenty of vacant and unreserved tables) we were taken upstairs Interestingly enough there's another hostess at the top of the stairs who seemed to be seating people who just walked right in. 

The patio menu is great if you're there just for a drink but very limited if you're hungry, offering only a few dishes from their main menu. Perplexing, as we could've had dinner there but felt compelled to leave in search of more options for food. We did order an appy (tripe chips) just to be able to say we are there. While tasty, it was a little high on the salty side. The accompanying sauce was quite overpowering and probably unnecessary. 

We also ordered some cocktails, one of which came with the kind of ice you see in McDonald's soft drinks (not a huge concern in the big picture but definitely not acceptable if you're a cocktail snob!). 

I'll come back in a few months to try the menu properly and to see if time and experience helps smooth things out.",2

6225,2,1549584000000,"Super trendy but in a good way (I think).  Straight from LA.  This is one of the places the beautiful people come to party.  Awsome fruity martinis.  Dark and loungy.  Crazy unisex bathrooms.

Update:  I was back at Six recently and was bored out of my mind.  The martinis were way too sweet.  The music was too loud.  The lights above the bar were positively blinding.  There entire freaking place was ""reserved"" seating only even though the place was practically empty when I got there (it was only 10 pm on a Friday).  My friend asked, ""Can we sit at a table?"".  ""No, that area is bottle service only.""  Her second question, ""Do you have any tables for paying customers that are here right now?""  Blank stare.  So... I'm sure Six is still a good time if you are in the right frame of mind.  I just can't give it a ringing endorsement anymore after my recent experience.",1
6234,2,1549584000000,"The pros...the menu is unique and portions are large.

The cons...the hostess and seating crew were a mess. The wait was nearly an hour, despite the 20 minute they suggested it would be. The people around us eating ... were complaining about being cold/not correct/etc. Management came to a couple tables to check on things. Seemed a little unorganized.  

Final result: If you have a lot of time and patience...try the chicken pot pie. Its enormous and quite good. I didn't see why all the hype however.",2
6245,2,1548979200000,"I purchased my tickets from Viator and wasn't aware of the actual tour company until I called to reconfirm my trip 24 hours prior as instructed. They advised me that I was to be picked up at my hotel at 6:15am and I'm pleased to report they were on time. The driver informed us we were to be driven to a terminal, checked in, and boarded on a different bus bound for our trip to the west rim. Once at check in, we were surprised with a $10 processing fee per person, something noted in the fine print at Viator but not mentioned outright. 

After check in, we boarded the bus driven by Mase bound for the west rim. He was very informative during the entire trip and we were kept apprised of everything coming up as well as the process involved. He did grow slightly impatient with a few tourists who failed to adhere to instructions about returning on time and rightly so. Some of us have better things to do than to wait on late tourists jeopardizing our return time.

Mase provided us with sufficient time to fulfill all our needs at the Hoover Dam and Grand Canyon West Rim. All in all, this was great tour that I would recommend. Although, I can't give 5 stars due to the surprise $10/person processing fee.",2

I ordered a 14"" pizza with cheese and pepperoni.  While waiting, the server brought me three garlic knots.  They were hot and fresh but they could have used more garlic.  The knots were accompanied by a small container of hot marinara for dipping.

In a normal amount of time, another server brought me the pizza and kidded me when she realized I was dining solo.  Later she came back and asked me if I wanted her to box the rest to bring home.

The pizza was good.  I prefer thick crust pizza but this was a credible thin crust pizza with a small amount of tomato sauce and more cheese and pepperoni.

I was impressed by the staff.  They were very friendly and they realized from the get go that I was a first time customer.  I'd recommend them and I'll probably be back if I'm in the mood for thin pizza.  I also had a chance to peruse the menu and saw the Italian dinners they serve.  Maybe that would be something to try.",2

6261,3,1550448000000,"This is a definite must-do when visiting Vegas. Just don't make our mistake and go hiking from 12noon until 4pm when the sun is at its hottest. And especially NOT at the height of summer in late August like we did! 

In the morning at 10am, the temperature is already at 106 degrees. I have no idea what kind of heat we were hiking in. But we both almost fainted. We were ill-prepared with only 3 regular sized water bottles and a bag of chocolate-covered popcorn between the two of us. Make sure you pack 3 kegs of water and a few portable bottles to carry with you during your hikes. You might also want some carbs in case the water isn't enough to sustain energy in your body. Luckily we had an umbrella. Yes, an umbrella-ella-ella. 

Seriously, once you drive into the scenic route, it's a long ONE way 13-miles to get out of there. We were almost gone at just 5 miles into it. I still remember feeling woozy and trying to drive when to our sides were some pretty sharp drops over the side of the cliff. I was so happy to make it out of there alive! 

Now the good thing about the hellish hot day was that admission was FREE. Apparently the national parks granted free admission on days that would be too psycho to step foot in here.

As for the canyon itself? Soooo beautiful. Nothing really compares. I was just amazed and couldn't believe it was real. The scenery feels like some kind of dream. Giant rocks with red stripes painted on them. I definitely want to take my son here. 

Most of the trip, there were only a handful of nearby visitors, but in the beginning part of our scenic drive, we somehow entered the Fast and the Furious minus Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Instead, just a whole lot of Asian racers. I think they were doing races.

Yes, we enjoyed the strip and nightlife, but this was one of the most amazing parts of our trip.",2
6265,1,1550793600000,"Pretty darn good for a company lunch spot.
We had a big group of about 14 employees come here during the busy lunch hours. Our server was quick, witty, and definitely knew how to describe everything on the menu. Must have aps are pretzels and cheese fondue plus the crispy shrimp.

From the exterior, it looks outdated and a little depressing; however, as soon as I entered the store, I was quickly greeted by the friendly staff. You can see the staff in the back preparing the various bagels. I was second in line at 7:00 AM and within a few minutes, the line extended to the entrance. People really like their bagels! When it was time to pay, I understood why so many people were here... for 8 dozen bagels and 8 tubs of cream cheese, I paid $80.

Back at the ranch, I had the sessame bagel with cream cheese ... if it just wasn't so rich with calories! Anyway, it was my Friday treat so guilt bye-bye.

Yay, I'm a fan.

6270,3,1549152000000,"Every Tuesday night after our late night hockey games, I join a rag tag collection of heroes, misfits and misanthropes at Four Peaks Brewery in North Scottsdale for some post game gab and nosh. I love these nights. We test our aging, yet surprisingly spry bodies mano-a-mano for adult hockey league glory and bond over drinks that no one actually orders because while Karina, our beloved server, may not know our last names, she knows we're predictable.

And speaking of it, I always order a plate of fries, or hope Brad E does. They're fucking delicious. T.A.S.T.Y. Big fan. But on this one lucky night, my boy Jerry W, genius that he is, orders nachos. I think nothing of it, until they arrive. They are GORGEOUS. Seriously beautiful. A culinary specimen clearly dispatched to our table by some immaculately conceived experiment working through the now divine hand of a short order cook. The guy, or lady, is a magician with these nachos. They're like eye-crack. Or better perhaps eye-(censored) as I visually molested each chip and chunk of cheese.

But like all impurities and roadblocks in our beautiful kingdom, like a cancer on the king's nose, these nachos were covered in chicken. I'm not even going to get into that discussion, but I don't do chicken. So I couldn't eat any of what I considered a plate of life-changing nachos, even before they changed my life. And I told myself ""Dally G., no matter what happens tonight, whether it's because you go to the store and get the ingredients or because you go to Filibertos and get their supernachos, you're dumb ass is going to be chowin' down on delightfully tasty nachos this evening.""

So here's one of the keys to the story. It was a done deal. I already believed with 100% certainty that I would be eating a plate of nachos that evening. Are you with me? A sure thing, no matter what. The universe had no choice but to comply. Emerson said it best, ""The world makes way for a mo fo who knows where he's going.""

But my friends didn't eat the whole plate. Nacho remnants teased me like those little shorts hot young women wear in the spring. I'm not gonna lie; more inspired to get fat I have never been.

Time passes and my thoughts stagnate (but without any of the negative connotation normally associated with the idea of stagnation). Nachos. Can't let it go...Men quip and pontificate and ask answers and tell questions and borrow my phone to look at (censored) and some hit on Karina but I am of one mind: Nachos. 

And a woman's voice rings out! She was three words deep and I knew my life was changed forever. You, dear Yelper, should have chills right now. She said, and I quote, ""Hey, the cook made these by accident. Does anyone want them?"" I knew what they were without turning around but I had to look because my eyes compensate for my imperfect relationship with the universe and I needed to connect the truth in my soul to my physical experience that I call existence, living.

She sat down chickenless nachos right in front of me. They were free. For me. More beautiful than the first plate, they sparkled. CHEESE SPARKLED!

What does this mean? So what? Big deal. Total coincidence, right?

I know in my heart I connected with those nacho-potentialities and made them come to be as the beautiful plate that was placed before me... There's no question in my mind. Not even the faintest hint of doubt. And every day since, I've made small things happen. Am I able to win the lottery? No. I tried. But I didn't BELIEVE believe. I only wished and hoped and did what everyone else does. My skills are weak. It's very different knowing that the money is already mine, compared to knowing I'd have nachos. Winning the lottery is a huge and powerful experience that I'm not prepared for... Everyone asks me to will them their hearts' desires. It doesn't work like that... I don't care if you find your wallet (I do, but not like I need to)... You need to believe that you already have it and it will happen. You can literally have anything you want if it's mutually beneficial to you and the object's relationship to the world.

I know. This sounds like voodoo. Hocus pocus. The Secret. Whatever. It's crazy. I don't know it's true. I just feel it is with every ounce of passion and love and creative energy I've ever experienced... I share this experience primarily because I enjoy being made fun of but if even one person gives it a try and finds power in their life I've done a very good thing.

6293,2,1549670400000,"We rented from Prima....that was a mistake. We stayed for a full year as our lease indicated. We're great tenants and keep the places we stay clean and in order and always pay our rent on time, if not early. Shortly after moving in we found out we had a large hole in the foundation of the basement. Tons of water got into the basement. The constant moisture got a rug of ours all moldy and ruined several boxes of our belongings as well. Prima never bothered to do anything about reimbursing us for our items ruined by their negligence of fixing the problem promptly. They just documented stuff in the computer, so they could forget about it I guess. With the hole and a few other things we needed fixed as well (a bathroom hook fell out of wall because where it was anchored in the wall was poorly patched, the toilet leaked down into the basement, closet door continually fell off the track) they had to put in a ""work order"" and then had their ""handyman"" (i use that term loosely) come out to fix it. 95% of the time time the work order seemed to get lost. I'd have to continually call to get somebody out there. It usually took a minimum of 2-3 weeks for anything to be done. The handyman did a poor job at fixing these things. I actually felt bad for the person that owned the duplex since these patch jobs were embarrassingly bad. I would be devastated if my home was repaired to his standard. These were problems that all happened as we were living there. Although, it all started out bad as of day 1. I looked at the place in the snow and for move in day it was all melted. The melted snow revealed piles upon piles of garbage the last tenants left piled up by the road and along the fence. It was disgusting and dangerous for my children and dog. They sent someone to clean it up a few days later (because they were to busy to send somebody that day). They came by and picked up the big items, put them in our trash and recycling cans, and left. Now my garbage was heaping full with no room for anything we may have been hoping to throw away (like there's not extra garbage with moving!!) and there was still tons of trash in our yard. Over a week later after angrily calling them they finally send a new person to clean up the rest of the garbage. He was kind and tried his best to rake up all the broken glass that was around. I've never been so happy to move away from somewhere in my life. I would sooner rent from anybody else, and highly advise everyone else avoids Prima as well.",2

The lunch buffet is delicious and lots of hot options, tons of great sushi rolls, and even dessert! All of the food was great. My only complaint is that they do not have a ""permanent"" buffet area. So they set it up and break it down each day. So when you go into the restaurant you can tell that it wasn't necessarily designed to have the buffet. The spacing and set up is a little bit awkward. 

The last time I went with my friend we got the soft shell crab appetizer! It was out of this world! I would highly recommend ordering it if you like tempura soft shell crab. 

For our entrees my friend got a sashimi rice bowl that had tons of different items on it. It had a great variety. You definitely get your moneys worth when you order that dish. I got two rolls - one was from their specials menu and the other was on the regular menu. Both of them were good. One was a chipotle roll - I didn't like how it had like a dry seasoning sprinkled on it that you could feel the gritty texture of in your mouth. 

The service the night we went was HORRENDOUS. After being seating it was probably about 5-10 minutes until the waiter came up to us and go our drink orders. Then it was about 5 mins for our drinks to come. Then he delivered our drinks and walked away from us even though we were ready to order. He disappeared for another 5-10 minutes. We placed our order.

He has family members with autoimmune so here is an outstanding medical doctor with first hand experience with autoimmune situations. He wrapped my foot, sent me to get a boot, allowed me to interject what I needed as far as medical equipment and set up limitations for driving and walking until the MRI.

Should I come back and give The Bean another try, so I can take a proper Latte Art photo? Maybe....",2

We had the seafood platter (half lobster tail, oysters and razor clams), lobster poutine (their signature dish) and the scallop entree.  The apps were amazing - but scallop entree was just so so.  Wasnt a fan of the corn mix that came with it, and overall portion was small considering the price (36$!).  I would be quite disappointed if I came here hungry, but since I've been snacking throughout the day, I was quite full from what we ordered.  Overall a great, but expensive, dinner experience!",2
6403,1,1551225600000,"I'm Korean. I'm picky about Korean BBQ. And this place is as authentic as it gets in Toronto. I tried a few Korean BBQ places around Toronto and the quality of the meat has been disappointing, but Kookminhakgyo's is great - it's lean and flavourful! It really is the closest thing to the Korean BBQ places I used to frequent in Seoul. Their pork belly is just mouthwatering, though I've had a selection of their other meats which are just as thumbs-up level fantastic.

Great atmosphere, great selection, great staff. I've been here twice and this is a place I'll be coming back to with more people. It's a cozy space, so make sure you head in early if you have a big group, or if you want to get in for dinner - I'd say around 6 is a good time to make sure you get a table.",2

Having been to a variety of Brazilian steakhouses this was pretty disappointing.  The selection of meats was not as great as most places I have been to which would have been reasonable had they not all tasted bad.  I have been to restaurants similar to this at slow times but this was not a slow time, or shouldn't have been.  Beyond the meat, I am traditionally not much of a salad person but very much look forward to the salad bar when I go to Texas de Brazil because it is very high quality and has an expansive selection.  The salad bar here was mediocre at best, considering we are in Wisconsin I was pretty disappointed to see a cheese selection that looked like it was straight off a party platter picked up at the local grocery store on clearance.

I am fairly new to the area and in the past would frequent Brazilian steakhouses about once a month.  From now on it will have to be a special occasion when I am traveling because I will not be returning.",2

this was my first FCUK shopping experience ever at the grand central outlet in devastatingly hot las vegas, although i've window-shopped the French Connection at the 3rd Street Promenade (that was prior to the realization that FCUK is French Connection). note to self: do NOT come here alone and do NOT come here friends who love to shop, only leads to feelings of guilty self-loathing and self-disgust, but with such unbeatable deals, how can one walk out empty handed after stepping foot into this discounted fashionable items galore? 

i passed up the demure navy peacoat, as cute, perfectly lengthed and cheap as it was after all the discounting (under $100)...but a friend's going back the next weekend, do i get her to go there (again)? the jacket fit perfectly, hit right past the knees and offered a nice slimming effect, but the main button was loose, and i took that as a sign to put it back on the rack, after wearing it around the store for thirty minutes straight (the loose button was detected prior to the thirty minute indoor parade). three of us tried on the same jacket in our respective sizes and circled the store and fitting rooms, while phoning friends and family to come check us out and give a yay or nay...

well, i walked out with three sweaters for under $100 (feeling very satisfied) and left behind that navy coat...and i'm okay with that. the button was a sign...a clear sign (but it was so cute! one of the three of us did purchase it in the end...and the same friend purchased the same colored FCUK labeled sweater as well, said we'd be FCUK buddies for life).

go to the info booth and present a AAA card to get a discount pamphlet, which entitles you to a 10% discount at FCUK, as well as other store discounts(unfortunately, i learned this too late). the staff was super friendly and very helpful and extremely patient/cool about our indoor peacoats parade. forget the casinos, bellagio water works show and cirque du soleil's, i'm coming back here for vegas (and the buffets). oh, and give yourself at least a good hour at this place (that is, at FCUK)",2

Contrary to what you might think, it's better to eat at a restaurant when it's busier rather than slow. Good cooks get ""in the zone"" and rock it out when it's busy. When its slow they space things off and in this case forget to flip my supposed to be mid-rare ribeye before it was too late and over cooked. 

Jen's steak was overcooked but not as bad. They must have been cooking a lot of fish because the grilled vegetables had that added flavor of old seafood. Not a combo I would have visioned but hey maybe some people like that warm fish taste all over their zucchini.  Great pun!  I'm hilarious.

Hands down the worst place I have ever been to, they didn't do anything right and my friends I will never return.

The wait staff have not been properly trained and have no idea how to wait tables. They don't speak proper English which make ordering for them difficult which results in mixed up orders or them not knowing what is on their menu. 
All the cakes are ordered in and are overly sweet or just horrible. The sauces put on the plate to decorate them messes with the cakes, as the sauces taste old and really sweet.  
Against his better jugdement a friend of mine ordered food there, what came to the table shouldn't be served to a dog it was so bad. It took 45 minutes for my friend's plate of pasta come to the table, it was a disaster. It was cold and the sauce they put on it looked an off yellow colourband it tasted as if was gone off.
The drinks are laughable, I have tended bar for 10 years, this place makes strip club drinks taste great. There is no creativity, no thought of balance in the drink, and they seemed to be out of a lot of stuff to make the drink properly. Almost every drink is over poured and they actually take pride in that.

The manager there comes off as a know it all, when he talked to us he was trying to correct us about every topic that he heard from the table. As well when he messed up another tables order and openly yell at his whole staff. Then talked to customers about the incompetence of the staff. He was overly friendly with the females at our table as well as other tables. His female staff seem to be uncomfortable around him. He comes off unprofessional, rude and just sleazy.

6612,3,1551312000000,"I was impressed with my meal at Essen and am looking forward to going back to try more! Here's why:

We ended up at Essen after trying to squeeze in at a well known Italian eatery nearby. They were all booked up for the night, so we continued east on Dundas and stumbled upon Essen. It is new to the neighbourhood and looked promising, so we walked in and asked for a seat. Lucky for us, they were able to tuck us in to the last remaining table at the back of the restaurant. The hostess was welcoming, cheery and happy to accommodate us on short notice. 

As we sat down, we quickly settled on wanting to try the roast cauliflower and roast eggplant. Unfortunately, our server let us know that these two dishes were all sold out for the evening, so we had to set our sights on some different eats. We then considered the seasonal greens but were again told that this was sold out. Pretty big bummer that three of the main vegetarian options were all sold out. Yet we pressed on and were still able to make some yummy selections.

We settled on trying the following dishes:

Appetizer: house-smoked olives with warm pita

Mains (to share): Caesar salad, peirogies, vegan fries, and fish schnitzel 

Dessert: the puff daddy


Appetizer: the house-smoked olives and warm pita were very, very nice. The olives are so flavourful. My only suggestion would be to warm up the olives. I think they'd taste much better and smokier warm. I was a bit surprised to bite in and realize how cold they were. Still, very yummy. The pita with fresh za'tar was perfect.

Mains:
That Caesar salad was one heck of a delicious Caesar salad. We ordered the small portion and were shocked at how huge it was! My guess is that they felt a bit bad for not having three of our requested dishes and so provided us with big servings. Whatever the case was, the salad was huge and bursting with flavour. When a Caesar salad is done right, it can be a beautiful thing. Here, the dressing was perfectly tangy and creamy and the pita-chip croutons were fantastic. 

The pierogies were also quite tasty. I'm not a huge pierogy fan but my dinner partner loves them and thought Essen's were particularly tasty. Again, large portion size.

The vegan fries were so, so good. My only qualm was how oily they were, but perhaps it was worth it given how tasty they were. They aren't typical fries...they're thick potato slices with a bit of a crunch but a perfectly soft middle texture going on. An added seasoning salt makes these things addictive!

The fish schnitzel was definitely a hit. We're both not fans of roasted red pepper so didn't use the sauce that accompanied the fish, instead opting for the house-made hot sauce. With the hot sauce, the fish was perfect. Crispy and flaky and juicy all at the same time. Just how fish should be! 

Dessert:
Meh. The dessert is about as lack luster as its namesake (no offence, P-diddy fans).


All in all, our meal was pretty starchy due to Essen being sold out of the main veggie options but was still very tasty. 


Bottom line: the prices were right, the atmosphere welcoming, and the food tasty. I'm sold to come back and give it another try! I'm confident that I'll be even more impressed next time I go, so long as they have what I want available. :)",2

Would never have thought that I would find such an amazing shawarma place up north from Toronto, but this restaurant really shines. Amazing chicken shawarma and gyro, very fresh and flavourful. 

We got the shawarma plate, and boy was it packed. A box filled to the brim with rice, potatoes, chicken shawarma, hummus and salad. It could fill one hungry person or even two mildly hungry people.

I understand accidents happen so we told the company that they will have to pay cash for the cost of the wedding picture and frame they damaged. They insisted on using the money towards the next 2 months of cleaning and we agreed, unfortunately. Knowing that we werent going to pay them for the next cleaning, the cleaners did an EVEN WORSE job of cleaning the house. Our oven was only cleaned on the bottom, our windows, fans, top of fridge, closets were uncleaned and they did not move chairs or trash bins or even my dogs small food and water bowl to vacum or mop underneath it. They literally vacum and mopped what was visible, didnt even go underneath the beds and there is enough space to crawl under them if you wanted! Me and my mother spent another HOUR together cleaning up after they left! To top it off, we had to argue with the manager about using the wedding picture credit to clean out house because she said she didnt have proof! Didnt even call their claims department or anything, as soon as it was brought up she said nope nope nope, dont have proof! Even after we sent her the proof of our previous emails stating we would have a credit she tried to nickel and dime us into paying. I THINK NOT! She did not know basic math and tried to overcharge us and then said, well we raised our price by $9. Excuse me?

At first I listened to other Yelpers and tried looking for someone handing them out, but didn't have any luck. Then I went to the theater and simply asked an attendant there if he knew about them and he directed to the casino cashier, where I found them sitting on the counter. Ended up about $13/pp after taxes and that includes an alcoholic (or not) drink. Awesome value for an hour of entertainment, especially in Vegas. Also, this may just be a temporary offer, but Mac King was telling us at the end of his show that the show tickets offered free admission to a show at the Flamingo called Battle of the Dance as well. We didn't take advantage of that offer, but what a deal. 

Anyway, onto the show. As long as you know you're not getting into a big budget epileptic light show production with scantily clad assistants, I think you will enjoy the show. It's small stage, no soundtrack or real sound effects, and the magic tricks are fairly low tech (ropes, cards, sleight of hand appear/disappear, etc...). However, Mac King is pretty funny, has a great attitude and does the tricks well. If you don't enjoy magic, this probably isn't going to change your mind. But the show keeps up the pace with magic one after another for the full hour. I don't know what the normal crowd is usually like, but that day probably only a third of the theater was filled, so it doesn't have the energy of a full crowd, but at the same time it didn't detract from Mac King's performance at all. This is probably one of the best values in entertainment in Las Vegas (if you go the discount route). This may be good or bad for you too, but the shows are at 1 and 3pm in the afternoon, so it doesn't interfere with other nightly activities.",3

We got three of their specials: baby back ribs, pork, and trout. All the dishes were cooked to perfection!

I also ordered their shrimp, andouille sausage and grits...oh my gosh, the flavor was phenomenal! 

It's definitely comfort food and you'll want to stay and ""savor"" every bite. I absolutely loved their blackberry and peach cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top!

To start, Dad got the deep fried deviled eggs - they were a little bland. Mom got the tomato soup - it was delicious.

For our entrees, Dad had the pork stew - it wasn't very stewy but it was ok and the corn bread was good. Mom had the sea bass - it was ok. I had the short ribs and they were delicious. 

For dessert we got the coffee creme brulee and the pecan pie. The creme brulee had a strong coffee flavor - good but strong. The fig pecan pie with citrus ice cream was good, but since I have the palette of a 5 year-old, I prefer classic sugary pecan pie. When we made the reservation, we mentioned that we were celebrating two birthdays so they comped our desserts and put candles on them - very sweet of them.

I got an apple pie, which should be the benchmark.  if you can't make an amazing apple pie, you should go into the cupcake business.  The apples were wafer thin and under-cooked, the spice was too strong, too much allspice or clove, over-powering.  Seasoning should be subtle and delicate with nice chunks of soft baked apples simmering a a delicious almost caramelized sauce....something to really blend in with Ice Cream if you go a la mode.  

The most telling sign has to be this.  My two kids ate two bites and left theirs untouched on the counter and a day later I have half the pie left.  Even the crappiest $5 pie from Fry's I pick at until it's long gone within 2-4 hours tops.  Today I brought the leftover to office, those vultures will eat packets of taco bell hot sauce.   

Maybe my palate is not sophisticated enough to appreciate a $20 artisan pie.  My palate doesn't give two shits about anything but taste and texture, period.  I can't will myself to hanker for this.  

Now my quest for a decent apple pie that I don;t have to bake myself continues. Thanks Pie Hole for reminding me my Grandma is dead and I can't go home again.",2

It is just a few doors down from a salon I go to so I thought it would be convenient; however the food just isn't that great.  I have tried several varieties of the empanadas as well as the tamales, but none of them were that ""special"".   The second time I came home with some tamales, my husband didn't even want to try them because they were so dry the first time (even steaming them to properly reheat).   I also tried a lunch plate that was an enchilada with beans and rice.  Actually it was a rather strange version of an enchilada--more like a folded over triaguilar tortilla with minimal fillings.  This place doesn't seem to know what it is--a take out restaurant, sit-down restaurant or caterer.  Most businesses are better if they try to excel at one thing rather than be everything.  I'd be a bit surprised if this place makes for another year or two with the current business plan it has going.",2

Their other pizzas seem pricy, but not having tried them yet I can't vouch one way or the other.

We came Osheaga weekend (risky, right?) but showed up at 9:00am and beat all the line ups and were served very quickly and efficiently. 

I ordered the Eggs Benedict with pulled pork and mushrooms. It was very tasty and filling (i got the two eggs option). They were cooked beautifully but I can't help but feel that something was missing. A bit of seasoning maybe? My friends all got the same thing, the salmon bagel avocado sandwich. They all enjoyed it but none of them could really finish the half of the avocado that was put into the sandwich. It was deepfried - but very lightly breaded, and the avocado texture/amount was a bit overwhelming (I tried it myself). If you're an avo toast kinda person then you'll probably enjoy it.

They were very patient and I felt that they truly wanted to help me with my automobile. The  lobby was very nice, and I felt that the people there were honest and trust worthy. I would return here again due to Becca's  customer service skills. Plus, I simply trust having a woman working on my car. She looked me straight in the eye and I could tell that she cared.

7012,3,1550707200000,"I did not visit this establishment so please take that into consideration. My review is strictly based on customer service over the phone during my intro call.  This review is for Phillip, the owner.

I relocate every 3-4 yrs and have been to every major city and fortunate to have my tresses coiffed by some of the industry giants (Jose, Christophe, Fred...) to name a few and spent $350+ every 6 weeks for years.  Yes, I was a hair snob but at this point I know what I need from a stylist and not all the best work is the priciest. 

According to previous reviews on this site it appears Phillip believes himself an artiste and most (not all) great artistes come with attitude. That said, Phillip, you need to train your staff not to repeat what you say if you want to obtain new clients via the promotions you advertise.  
And your promo needs to stipulate: ""A stylist will be assigned to you"".  

At this point in my life I prefer to bond with a female stylist.  I was told only Phillip does Balayage. No problem, have not had this color treatment in years and I miss it. I asked the very youthful sounding receptionist if it was OK that I have my cut with another stylist and color w/Phillip.  She said ""sure"" and then ""wait, let me check""...

When she came back to the phone (after speaking with her boss) her reply was that ""with the promo, you get who you get""  and picking your stylist is ""for paying customers"".  Is it just me or is that the epitome of rude?  Not her fault, she just parroted back what he told her.  

I've never used a ""promo coupon"" before but seems everyone does these days so because the 1st cut is usually a disaster I thought I'd take a risk and hopefully be pleasantly surprised (based on some other reviews of Phillip's female counterparts I was hopeful to find a fit) especially since it's not far from my new home. 

Needless to say I'm back to my search and most likely paying full price.  Hair is as much a customer service biz as an artistic endeavor and I hope this serves to educate and causes no harm to any of the other stylists deserved of praise.  I too worked in a salon (front desk) in my early 20's and learned the graceful art of editing the stylists (sometimes awkward) remarks.  Oh well, back to the drawing board...",2

The biggest problem I have with BD is the prices. For $9 I could go to Melt and buy a Smokey Russian for the same price and still have leftovers for the next day. Or if I wanted something less heavy, I could go to Subway and get a foot long sub for nearly half the price. 

Places usually get away with charging higher prices for food because they have a certain vibe, seating, free wi-fi, etc. (ie: Phoenix Coffee, Starbucks, etc). Or their food is so superior and unique that price doesn't matter. Last I checked, BD's permanent seating options consisted of 2 stools in the corner  - or going into the Old Angle Tavern (which has its own tasty lunch menu btw). 

BD has made a good attempt, but they need to lower their prices by about $2.",2

To start, the Trump is reasonably prices (for a 5 star) the guest services are very nice and treat you well as you come in the door. The Lobby is clean, well laid out and beautifully appointed. Big plus for me was that this hotel does not try and nickel and dime you, Internet, paper, pool and much more are part of the room fee.  Hell I have seen hotels try and charge you bottled water but not here.

All rooms as suites and we got the city view which is what really made the stay the best. So here is the break down

PROs:
1.) Clean and beautifully done hotel 
2.) Friendly Staff who are quick to respond to each request and with a smile
3.) Great rooms with stocked kitchen (for 2)
4.) Great Views
5.) One if the best beds I have ""slept"" on. 
6.) Huge/ deep jet Tub
7.) TV in the Bathroom mirror (Basically a bathroom you want to hang out in )
8.) Pool is great and again staff is helpful. 

CONs:
1.) TV sucks, (Freezes, delay in channel change limited channels) Then again who goes to Vegas to watch to TV!!
2.) Train noise is unavoidable, no matter what room you are in you will hear it. I think it just blends with the city noise.

Final: Not only will we be coming back, but this makes us want to travel to the other hotels in the chain.",2

I guess I should have started wondering when the server wouldn't entertain the idea of giving us a small sliver of lemon in our water (unless we bought Perrier). The place is not exactly fine dining but given the average cost of an entree, it's not exactly McD or BK either ! 

The food arrived and one portion was significantly smaller than the other both in terms of meat and sides. We drew this to the attention of the server and got a blank stare. The manager came over and proceeded to tell us to sprinkle the peri peri flakes on it.... Not sure if these were magic flakes that turn into food when leaving the shaker but he seemed to think this would solve our issue. 

When we pressed the issue, I didn't know where to look when he said ""you don't need the extra carbs anyway"". I think he meant it as a joke, or at least I hope he did, but given that I am quite stocky, I was quite offended. He is probably correct, I don't need the carbs, but it's not his place to say that - completely inappropriate.

Ok. Changed to 2 stars.  Delivery guy just showed up with food an hour and a half after i ordered. He played like he didn't know what I was talking about. I think they hurried, made food and delivered. My kids were ecstatic so we're happy now.  But the chow mein and moo goo gai pan were the exact same things.",3
7126,1,1549843200000,"LOVE!! I just love mediterranean food... but then again, I'm half arab, so I kinda have to love mediterranean food. But I wasn't sure if my typical white-boy of a husband would like it, and to my surprise he loved it too. I ordered the chicken shish kabob entree... came with rice, chicken, some spinach thingy, and bread, and I also ordered a side of hummus.... basically more than enough to satisfy my tiny self, but it was all soo good that I just couldn't stop eating. The spinach thing was very flavorful and the chicken was cooked to perfection. I ordered the beef kabob entree for the husband and that also came with rice, spinach and bread. All very good and tasty as well. My mom and brother both got the chicken kubidehs entrees and seemed to enjoy their food as well. It was a little spicy for me, but some people like spicy :)
Staff were nice and friendly(well, the cooks didn't really look thrilled to be there, but then again... whose actually happy to go to work? lol), restaurant was clean and very well-lit environment, and just outside this restaurant is a decent view of the strip. I would absolutely come back here again, and I would definitely love to bring my in-laws here when they come to visit. If my (picky) husband loves it, then I'm sure they will too!",2

As a musician myself I can hear it in their performances.  You can kind of tell the pieces they spend time on and the ones that are ""one and done"" in rehearsal.  I understand why, the costs are so huge to get everyone together, but it is still sad.  HUGE problem with the Phoenix audiences.  I have never heard so many people talking during a performance in my life as I did the one time I was in the balcony.  Wanted to scream...

7142,1,1550793600000,"This company moved me from a 4 storey townhouse in Etobicoke to a 3 bedroom apartment in Port Credit on July 3rd 2014.  This was a major downsize and I was really stressed about the move.  Tony and the crew arrived on time and worked flat out.  They were very reassuring and made no complaints about the stairs.  Everything was wrapped in plastic or pads and they disassembled my bedroom set.
Unfortunately when we arrived at my new address,  55 Park Street East,  only one elevator was working so they couldn't leave it on service.   This added about 3 hours to my move but it was in no way the fault of the movers who continued to put a cheerful face on things.
As it turned out the elevator problems were a portent of things to come.  I have mobility issues,  can't use the stairs and my apartment was on the 12 floor.   Frequently over the summer the elevators weren't working and I was trapped in my unit, to the point where the landlord released me from my lease.   Thus I found myself having to move for a 2nd time in 3 months. 
Again the crew were fantastic.   They arrived on time and again worked non-stop.  I have a lot of art and was worried about it.  None of my paintings sustained any damage in either move.  Neither did anything else. They were very careful and put all of the things I wanted in storage in my locker.   They were also really supportive and encouraging about how they thought I'd be much happier in my nrw place.
I pray I won't be moving anytime soon, but if I had to I would call these guys in a heartbeat.   The bill was precisely as advertised.   Thank you so much and keep up the great work.

7168,1,1551052800000,"I quite enjoy Just Braise and even though it is so close to where I live I don't seem to go that often. So Just Braise is located in a fairly new plaza and the two times I have visited it was not overly packed. There was always a steady flow of people eating in or getting take out. I like the rustic modern vibe and the staff greet you immediately after you walk in. Love the friendly and quick service!

As I mentioned I have only been twice, the first time I got take out and I got the pulled pork sandwich while my friend for the beef banh mi. We shared the kimchi fries which I recall being very tasty. I remember enjoying the pull pork sandwich which was packed with flavour and definitely a comfort food item. Both my friend and I finished our sandwiches and were satisfied.
Recently, I made another visit with my hubs this time since I wanted to take him to place he has not been to but also close to home. He opted for the karage sandwich with a side- beef stew. I got the karage bites since I wanted something to munch on and we shared the beef stew. The star of the show imo was the beef stew! I thought I was getting a dark brown maybe extremely salty stew but it was completely opposite! It looked like chicken noodle soup but of course more thick and with beef. It was so delicious..Man I wish I got the full size!! The staff actually recommended either the beef stew or chili and I am so glad I tried the stew or I was going to get my usual chicken noodle soup lol!

One thing about my most recent visit was the service, we were asked if we liked the meal and we were served water once we took our seats. The food was served at our table even though Just Braise is like a fast food set up where you order, and get your food yourself.

I will definitely be making another visit..I need more beef stew in my life!!",2

Of course, they offered the service at a costly price.  Being that I am a bargain shopper, I went ahead and checked out Groupon and just searching.  As always, find out the best on Yelp.  Best prices and the reviews with 5 stars, can't argue with that!!!  

Sean was able to come by, even though I wasn't home.  I know what you are thinking, have someone I just met into my garage when no one is home?  I thought so too, but he is very trustworthy.  Gave me the breakdown on what needed to be done and what it would cost for additional work.  Of course, I just chose to do the minimal in hopes to save some cash.  After about an hour, I texted Sean to say go ahead and wax it for the additional cost.  10 minutes later, talked with Sean and he said we were all done.  Again, gave me the breakdown of why the grease wouldn't wash out, how he got it out, and how to take care going forward.  

Got home later on that day to find the car in spectacular condition.  Buffed, waxed, and vacuumed!!!  Sean left the invoice on the car but he only charged me for the buff.  Not the wax or the internal cleaning...of course I got the thumbs up from the wife and they have now a lifetime customer for all my car cleaning needs.  Don't hesitate to call.

7206,1,1550966400000,"Went there with a large group last Saturday evening. Because it was a large group they forced everyone to have the $25 dollar prix fixe menu which included an appetizer (the salad or soup), a main (burritos, fajitas and one more), and churros for dessert with tea and coffee. I had to really force the waitress to give me an a la carte dish as I do not eat dessert and she reluctantly agreed after calling her over for a second time and told me not to tell the other group members (I sat at the end of the table). I had looked at their menu online and it said that their Pollo con Mole was their ""main house specialty"" so I ordered that. 

Firstly they forgot to give us their complementary nacho and salsa which was admittedly good, once we told them we didn't get any after 25 minutes of waiting. 

When everyone got their appetizers a whopping 30 minutes later (because it was a group perhaps) it was the miniature salad with 1000 islands dressing that seems to be on the pictures of all the main dishes in the reviews below. I'm confused, IS THIS MINI SALAD AN APPETIZER OR IS IT SUPPOSED TO BE PART OF THE MEAL. Methinks scam. In any case it was a pathetic salad. 

Finally we got our main dishes. My Pollo con Mole didn't look like the picture online, did not contain any feta and as stated in other reviews the rice seemed bland. THIS IS THEIR SPECIALTY? WHAT A JOKE! The food was NOT good but edible. All of the 10+ members of the group who got the prix fixe meals agreed. From enchiladas to fajitas to burritos all overpriced and lacking any discernible taste.

To follow this up they provided two churros for dessert to the prix fixe members of the group, which were probably the worst I've tasted. I got a chance to taste part of one as almost everyone stopped eating after they forced down the first. 

Finally, an automatic gratuity. I understand this policy but for such garbage service and food I wouldn't have tipped as much.

If you want better go to: fat bastard burrito, big fat burrito, burrito boys, chipotle or even mucho burrito. La mexicana is not in any way more authentic than these places. The fajitas at Kelsey are just as authentic, are far more tasty, have much more quantity, and are far cheaper. 

Did I mention my stomach was upset afterwards? Must've been the premiumly priced $20 refried beans.",1

I tried their pizza which was delicious, extremely thin crust which I liked. Their sandwiches were also really good. I have no idea what they did to it but the crispiness combined with the bacon and sauce just made it soooo good. I also got to try their french toast which was ok. Nothing too special about it. Out of everything I tried, I actually liked their sandwiches the most.

This place is probably best to hit if you want a casual lunch/brunch. Just remember, their brunch is only available on Saturdays.",2

Sometimes they get super busy with take out orders and may take a little while to check on you or bring you the check, but no big deal we just walk up to the counter and ask for what we need and they will bring it to you quickly.

I love the taro-almond milk slush. The big black tapioca balls are the best but so is the royal milk slush and the lychee. It's hard to choose my favorite since everything they have is so good. It's so nice that they seal it up for you too so you can take some home and refrigerate a drink for later.

It was close walking distance kinda of to things.  Weird weather so stayed completely in hotel second night.  Ate at hotel restaurant.  It was okay. Public areas at least in the morning are a mess.  Woke up early and used the hotel lobby restroom to go Number 2 out of courtesy and safety to the other in my room.  Disgusting.  Went to front desk inquiring if there was another bathroom.  I probably looked homeless and she asked if I was staying there.  Then asked if my room was okay implying why I needed to use a public restroom.  I was grouchy and holding it in so much that I was duck walking.  I told her my lover was rough and my backside may bleed all over the bathroom.

Also would pick up a six-pack of Stroh's beer. Well, the little 55 cent burgers and the Stroh's beer are long gone, but the fries remain, and are as delicious and greasy as ever. 

Back in the day they served the fries in properly proportioned containers--now they put a little paper container on a tray and dump a huge quantity of fries over the entire tray.

This Verizon location sells one of the best products and has an awesome display of phones. Lots to choose from. 

You can also pay your bill here. There is a $3 service charge if you pay cash but if you use your card there is no charge. Who can beat that? 

I am definitely going to use my upgrades here and provide this location all of my future business! Especially if Tiffany is there! Don't get me wrong, everyone is very nice but she is pretty cool.

My haircut was very generic and wasn't what I asked for. Not bad, but  not good. Won't be going back there again, but not too upset or anything because it'll grow back.

Went for lunch today.  They are now offering lunch portions (at lower prices), and honestly they are still pretty huge!  My wife and I were not able to finish either of our dishes.  We each have another meal from the leftovers.  For 99 cents you can add either soup or salad to a lunch entree.

The food is good, the portions are large, and they do a lot of coupons (which make the price quite reasonable).  Without a coupon they are a little expensive, though not outrageous.  Join their e-club and you'll get coupons in email, plus they have them in the paper and sometimes in coupon mailers.  So they aren't difficult to get.

Today I tried their Tuscan bean soup.  I think it would have been good if it weren't so salty.  I mean really salty!  But behind the salt I could taste what seemed like a decent bean soup.  This is the only thing I remember having a problem with at Buca.  But they replaced it with minestrone, and that was pretty good.

We will be back before Sunday as we have a $10 off of $20 purchase email coupon, and we definitely want to use it!!",2

Unfortunately we've been twice and it wasn't any better the second time. I did wait to see if perhaps it was only one instance, but they just aren't interested in good service I guess.

It's been very juicy and spiced perfectly both times; however, the portions are very small for the price, and neither time I got tzatziki or lettuce on my gyro, just a ton of onions and tomatoes. I thought that tzatziki was a standard amongst gyros but apparently it costs extra here? I saw you could purchase it for an extra $0.75, but I thought it would at least come in the gyro. It's good in a pinch, but I'd drive the extra 10 minutes to go to Greek Village in Lakewood.",2

7372,1,1550534400000,"First off I got to give props to Andrew for always giving me such a great experience anytime I visit. This place is basically the dtlv experience but on a more intimate level.

The selection for drinks they have is very extensive. Huge variety of drinks on tap as well as having a decent cocktail menu. Genesee lager for $3?! What a steal! The cocktail menu changes every once in awhile to keep it fre$h. My recommendation would be to get the drink with basil and strawberry syrup! On point.

What really attracts me to this place is the ambiance. I feel very comfortable here. The place doesn't get too crowded but at the same time it's never really dead inside. Inside you can be mellow. Have small talk at the bar or in front of the projector. Outside the atmosphere is a little different. Watch local bands play or just take a seat and admire those cool string lights you wish you had at home.

This place just touches on every point of what a 5 star place should be. Customer service, ambiance, and drinks at a great price point.

All of that for $5? SIGN ME UP!

3-4 stars for prices, staff & the service I got.

I'll go with 3.

In general, Spa Lamar feels very run down. Very sad. It is not like larger hotel spas in the area so don't come in with that expectation.

All spa areas are co-ed, so you gotta keep your clothes on.

No food on-site, but they ordered Jason's Deli for us and had it delivered. No booze either, and we didn't bring our own. Shucks.

Pool wasn't working and it was 105 out. No lounge chairs, just wooden chairs, so do not come here to lay out until that problem is fixed. 

Massage was good - can't believe how quick 85 minutes go. The prices are higher than a chain like Massage Envy, but much more reasonable than a big hotel spa for instance.

In summary: Don't come here to take advantage of the amenties (there are few). Come for the treatments and bounce.",1

7414,2,1550275200000,"This guy has a decent selection, but the humidor is cramped and waaaaaay too crowded with product. You can hardly walk around without tripping on boxes of cigars stacked all over the floor. 

Also the owner has HORRIBLE customer service skills. I've been three times and have had a negative experience each time. 

First, they follow you around the humidor, and don't want you to touch anything. I'm fine with not touching, but I like to walk around and look for a cigar that sparks my interest or sounds good at the moment... it is very uncomfortable with the guy stalking you the whole time in the very small humidor. No room to turn around let alone with the owner breathing down your neck. 

Second, the guy sold me a crap Xicar lighter with a ""lifetime warranty."" It only works with the flame turned to full blast and the fuel absolutely full. So you have to re-fill it after each cigar. When I took it back to him he filled it, turned it up to full blast and said ""see it works"" and wouldn't do anything else for me. 

Third, I stopped in, and decided to smoke one of my cigars there. Its AZ, and its hot outside. He has chairs with guys smoking in the front of the store. I sit down and smoke one of the cigars I bought and I got a bunch of dirty looks from him. Apparently the chairs are for ""members only.""

Finally, on my last trip there, I decide to grab a quick lunch cigar. I go in, buy a $7 cigar and pay CASH. He tells me, next time there is a minimum purchase of $10. Apparently my 30 seconds in the humidor (I hurried because he stalks you) and my $7 cigar weren't worth stopping his poker game with his ""members."" I'd understand a minimum purchase with credit as I know small businesses struggle with the fees imposed, but I paid CASH.

Their appetizers are the stars here.  We really enjoy the cold spring rolls (shrimp and pork), crispy egg rolls (solo shrimp is an option), and crispy rice with egg (seriously, this is the one to try!). Their rolls are nicely filled, and served with delicious dipping sauces.
 
My husband and I have tried their pho and vermicelli entrees.  For pho, I prefer the seafood noodle soup, and my husband prefers the beef varieties.  Sometimes, the broth is a bit more flavorful on different visits.  But I really like that different sizes are available for various appetites.  

Service has improved since they initially opened.  They are now speedier, and while we still aren't fond of the pop music they stream, we appreciate how efficient they've become.

Their menu has also expanded since opening.  They now have a shrimp vermicelli dish on their menu that is OUTSTANDING.  It rivals Lang Van's vermicelli bowl (seriously).  The shrimp are huge, plentiful, and extremely flavorful.

It's Saturday night!  It's always busy!  So the results were it took over an hour and a half to get our food when it usually takes 20 min and when it finally arrived, they forgot half of the sushi order!  I've been to other excellent sushi places where they will put as many chefs behind the sushi counter as necessary to keep up with demand... But not with katana.

Big plus for allowing outside drinks and for decent concessions. Almost everything from beer to food is under $10, which is nice when considered this is only a tiny mark-up over the prices in the bars outside.

I popped in for a speed lunch with my Yelper friend Su-Shien and was *delighted* by the food, service and decor. Think fancy pants (chandeliers sprinkle the room) with rustic touches (cord is used to tie silverware). The space is intimate yet casual. Two top tables can readily be combined for larger groups. 

I would love to return for dining IN the kitchen. That's right: There's a bigger table where the magic happens. Friends of mine have eaten there and raved about it. (Soon!)

The food is made for sharing. Nosh boards range from meat, veges, cheese, fondue and (get this) plain ole' bread and butter. My first experience was with the charcuterie (meat) board. The menu doesn't do justice to what is delivered. Delicate sides accompany prosciutto, sopprasata, bresola and spanish chorizo. Thinly sliced wafers of bread can be layered with violet mustard, apple chutney and pickled shallots. We made our selection while enviously eyeing the table next to us.

....where The Very Jennifer was seated! She's a breath of fresh air! So sweet it (almost) hurts. You'll love her (and everyone else that works there).

I've read some reviews about how this place reminds them of a Subway and I can see why.  While Subway focuses on the sandwich, this place offers soups, salads, and sandwiches, which is ok.  (Note: Before I go to a restaurant, I usually look at the menu so I know what I'm going to order when I get to the place.  I was disappointed to see that for the CYO Salad, while they had a decent variety of dressings/lettuces/toppings/etc. to choose from, they were pretty limiting to how many toppings you can choose!  What about those people who wants lots of vegetable toppings and not just 4?) Regardless, I decided to try it out tonight.  I have to admit that I'm not terribly happy with my first time here.  Having had nursed an upset stomach for the past few days, I decided to go with a vegetable soup with a clear broth and the vegetarian sandwich.  The soup was pretty salty.  That's about all I can say about it.  The sandwich wasn't too bad, but I wasn't too impressed with it. For the portion amount, I feel like both was a bit overpriced.

7606,1,1549670400000,"Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by the good quality dumplings you can buy at Chinese grocery store, ormaybe it's because I've had better dumpling for less in Chinatown and regular chinese restaurents, and most definitely because I've read all the raving reviews on yelp before trying out this place, but but Quing Hua was rather a let down for me.

Choice: 

Many choices of dumpings, I have only try the old classic of dumplings, porc and chives.

Quality: 

The dough is not particularly chewy or delicately textured, it is more akin to the factory-made/bought-at-minimal-price-at-your-local-grocery than hand-made. They probably did not made it themselves. 
 
The porc and chive filling itself is rather bland, all I could taste is porc, which suggest that A) not enough chive and other spices and B) chives is really not fresh. The portion of filling is not generous either.

Portion:

The overall portion isn't great compare to other cheap eat in the area, especially for its price.

Service:

Poor

When I went there, it was 3:30pm on a week day and I was the only customer, nonetheless it took a good 20 minutes for my food to arrive, and the waitress was exceedingly busy chatting with her colleagues in the kitchen to bother with basic waitressing. 

Price:

About 15 small-medium size dumplings for 10+ bucks is a tad bit pricey for it's cheap-eat quality and service.

Overall: 

There are just so many more restaurants in the Concordia area with higher (quality+service)/price quotient than Qing Hua...",2

Secondly, COMPLETELY SHADY company that looks like it is out to screw with both your time and money.
This was our experience - special WARNING to Groupon customers...

First of all, they picked us up on the Strip and stuck 15 people crammed into a 12 person van.  It was completely unsafe for a 30 minute ride from the strip, and an indicator about how we would be treated during the day.

At this point, they could have informed the folks with sandals and shorts that they were not well dressed for the adventure, and that they were putting themselves in danger of injury.  They didn't.  The offered the girl in flip flops shoes once we were out at the site, though.

In the van, we all signed a standard liability waiver. There was a secondary document to sign that affirmed that we had been informed about the endangered desert tortoise and how to behave ourselves to keep the tortoise safe.  My partner had read up on this on the website, but I hadn't heard anything about it.  There was no further information about this shared with the group, although the company is apparently under some kind of government commitment to inform customers about this.  No such thing is happening.

WARNING - this is where the scam totally starts!  We stopped at the gas station to use the ATM machine because their debit/credit card reader on site at the place where we would be riding ""wasn't working like it should"".  They recommended everyone use the ATM to get cash if they hadn't paid yet.  An all cash interaction?  Really?  What is this, an attempt to avoid taxes?

We got out to the riding site, and they have us all get our helmets and gloves, but they start to call us over one at a time to ""go over"" some information back at the van.  At this point, I was informed that we never paid the ""taxes"" for the trip, which was not covered by Groupon.  We were to hand over 16 dollars, in CASH only, and were never handed a receipt or anything to prove that it wasn't just going straight into their pockets.  What taxes?  Where was that explained on the Groupon or company website?  Total scam.

The website advertises a 2 hour tour, and full day tour.  We had the half day tour but we only rode for less than an hour - the rest of the time was taken doing prep and rundown of the equipment.  Ok I guess I can live with that, but the kicker was the next thing that happened. 

They should have informed their customers before the tour that if there was only a half tour that we would be STANDING AROUND in the parking lot, waiting for the others to finish their tour. There was no one available to take us back to the strip and a taxi ride would be expensive.  But no, they waited for us to get to the ""midway point"", still a large distance from the parking lot, to make the decision if we wanted to head back and wait in the heat for the others to finish the extended tour, or join them for an extra CASH fee.  This was super manipulative and clear evidence that they were gong to make things so uncomfortable for people that they were going to eventually give in an pay more for the day.

7642,1,1551225600000,I highly recommend this company. The gas water heater that we had installed today was the third item from American home water that we have had installed. The first being the water softener system and the second being the r O  system. Angel was our installer. He was super efficient professional and friendly. He arrived much sooner than what we were originally told. The prices that American home water charges blow the other competitors out of the water. American home waters price was almost half what a plumbing company in Mesa quoted me. We also take advantage of their water filter replacement service. What American home water charges is equal to what it would cost to replace the filters if we bought them from a home-improvement store.,2

I thought it was odd they didn't offer combo meals for their tacos.  The salad was okay it tasted more like pepper spiced tomato paste my friends got a side of the hot to mix in but they didn't like the flavor of the hot. The food was decent you can tell they focus on their seafood and that dish tasted the best.,2

The food was really tasty, Blackened Mahi Taco's with Avocado pasta and Battered Shrimp Taco's with rice. We all had NODA Jam Session draft beer and that was really good as well. We arrived 20 minutes before closing and we're told as we walked in to order quickly and we felt rushed by the staff and especially the waiter. When he brought our beer he told us if we wanted another it was last call, so we asked for one and he told us we had to drink the first before he could bring another - apparently state law.  OK, so why tell us it was last call.  No attention. No care in our food or service.  We'll go back but not within 30 minutes of closing.  We felt rushed and ignored!",2

She was pleasant and invited me to come on down so they could take a look at the issue with the glasses. When we arrived we were greeted by Kristine who took the glasses and not only repaired what what was wrong, but also tightened everything. We were in and out in no time and back to enjoying our vacation.

7670,1,1548979200000,"I Parked next to one of the many signs warning that non-customers will be towed.  I went in and ordered a hot dog and fries to go, but  instead of driving off -- as was expected of me-- I decided to check out the cool looking Falafal joint across the street.   One thing led to another and before I knew it I was scarfing down one of the tastiest tahina's I've ever had.
Somewhere between my fifth and sixth chick pea ball, a tow truck appeared in  La Belle Province's lot.   With humus dripping down my face I ran towards my car hoping to avert disaster.    The owner of La Belle Province stood there, madly waving his arms and yelling at me in Mandarin.  Thinking quickly, I tore open my grease saturated  take-out bag and showed him the steamie I had purchased only 10 minutes earlier.    He looked at the hot dog, and then at me.   I don't speak Mandarin, but I could tell by the veins throbbing in his sweat coated forehead that he wanted me and my take-out  gone without further delay.   On the drive home, while plotting an elaborate revenge scheme, I was suddenly overcome by a rare sense of well being and comfort.   The wonderful aroma of frites was filling the interior of the car.

7673,1,1551312000000,"We stayed at the Sofitel towards the end of August, 2014. We booked in the Sofitel as opposed to the other leading hotels we had on our list due to the raving reviews we saw here on Yelp and TripAdvisor about how wonderful this place was to stay.
Our stay, however,  turned out to be one with never ending bloopers from beginning to end. One would've thought we were being punked or something!!! 

We had 2 rooms booked. A week or so prior, we contacted the hotel to give them a heads up..part of the party were arriving early and ask for early check-in. At which point, we were advised it would't be guarranteed but that they would do their best and  it was likely that they would be able let us check in early.

We arrived at the hotel  at about 11:30am on a Thursday.  The door man was very friendly, the lobby area looked immaculate, warm greeting at the front desk... impressed so far.  
We spoke with Peter at the front desk, who was very nice and professional, no complaint!  Asked for my ID and a credit card to be attached to our rooms for ""incidentals"".
Just to  make sure, I confirmed this was just for incidentals and that both  room charges should be charged to the CC that was used at reservation. Peter confirmed- ""Yes the card we already have on file will be charged, this is just for incidentals, but that the amount they would place on hold on my card would be the total price for each rooms plus $100.00/day for incidentals"" -- which he said would come up to about $2600.00!!! Wait what??  If it is just for incidentals, why so high? Shouldn't it just be the $100/day for each room?  Anyway, we went round and round and apparently it is their policy.   I provided him with my card after confirming again that the card is NOT going to be hard charged unless we tell them otherwise at the end of the stay--(I didn't want my card to be charge since we as a group have already agreed to have all the hotel charges on the other girl's card to avoid any unneccessary INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION CHARGES).  He confirmed that they will charge whicever credit card we instruct them to charge, for this purpose it will just be a hold.  

OK, so after all that, he told us  our rooms weren't ready yet, which we understood.  Suggested a lunch spot for u s to try while we wait and asked  for us to come back maybe around 2:30sh, as he thinks the rooms should be ready by then. Walked us to concierge to have our luggage held for us.

We came back about 10 til 3:00pm.  A diff gentleman was there, our rooms weren't ready yet. Directed us to the waiting area. 3:30pm, the rep came to us with apologies, offered for us to wait at the bar and that they would BUY us our drinks as our rooms are still being cleaned.  He brings us to the bar and introduces us to the bar tender, again, extends his apologies and hands us a card and said someone would come and get us when our room is ready. Thanked him for being kind. 

Sat down and Whoa!! the drinks at that bar were all average $20 bucks each pop!!!  Anyway, we order our drinks, I take a sip of mine.. take a closer look  and it had something EXTRA swimming on it!!  Wow, really???????  There was a fly or a bug of some sort on my drink!!!! GEEZ!!  At this point, I was really starting to dread having to stay at this hotel-- it was one thing after another!!!! Approached our server to change out my drink. so we sit around..it is 4:30sh at this point, I go back to the front desk-- Different reps are there,  I walk up and politely asked about our room to which she responds ""Ah yes, madame, your rooms aren't ready yet, but you are at the bar waiting correct? They are still cleaning your room, Pls go back to the bar and enjoy your drinks and we will come and get you"" ..5:30 still no room, not even just ONE of the rooms!!  6:00pm, I go to the front desk again.. still no room available!! 6:15 the front desk rep comes to the bar to let us know ONE of our rooms are ready. So we get ready to leave and we were told we had to close out our tabs.. it turns out they were comping our first drink.. and the second one we  were responsible for..Over 2 hours wait!!! At this point, we just wanted to go up to our room and freshen up as we've had a long day. Our fligth left FL at 5:00am, so you can just imagine. 
Nightmare didn't end there.. they weren't able to give us our second room until AFTER 7:00 pm... they ended up charging our rooms to 2 seperate cards after we had explicitly asked them at time of check-in and then again at check-out to charge the one designated CC.  So many other issues that came up during the stay.  Disspointed with this hotel, as contrary to the good reputation they have, there didn't seem to be any initiative on their party to resolve the issues that kept coming up.  For the price you pay, you can find a much better place elsewhere with more reliable service.",2

We went last night prior to fright dome and all I can say is that I make better food at home! That is not good! 
We ordered a large 6 to 8 person appetizer platter that was supposed to be loaded with nachos, quesadillas, a spinach dip with chips, mozzarella sticks, barbecue spareribs, and a few other items. The platter came and it was loaded with all of these things, all of which tasted like food that was taken from a package from the freezer that was bought at Albertson's! To add to that,it also tasted like that same food was leftovers from another party. It was disgusting and we only touched 10% of it. The platter cost $40 and we all agreed that we threw $40 down the drain. 
The drinks were average but that is not what we came here. We were literally hungry and we left hungry!
Simply put, we are not even going to try to go back here again. This place needs to have new management or a better chef or something. Hands-down, one of the five worst 'restaurants' I have been to in Las Vegas.",2

It doesn't seem that big, but there is merchandise everywhere. Rings, bracelets, necklaces, trinkets, earrings, sunglasses, bags and belts.

From reading some other reviews, it seems the big issue with this place is the amount of time it takes to get one's food.  In fact, I ate here in August '11 when they were in a different location in the same complex and had the same issue.  Food just took too long to come out.  

Today, and to the cook's credit, my sandwich came out quickly.  I got the Balboa sandwich, which was killer!!!  The bread was great, the fries were hot and crisp, and the veggies, cheese, and roast beef were delicious.  I'd add a star if they spruced the place up a bit.  It looks so run-down inside, which is strange because it hasn't been there very long.",2
7702,3,1548979200000,"Tried this based on Stephanie S. recommendation.  I had the Tandoori Chicken Kabob dinner. It was 11.49 before taxes.  While I loved the rice, I found the chicken to be too much like Indian tandoori chicken and didn't really differentiate itself.  Don't get me wrong, the meat was pretty flavourful, but I expected something different than Indian tandoori chicken.  

Also, the salad was limited as it was just a few leaves of lettuce and some diced tomatoes on top.  I was expecting a bigger salad, with sliced tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce.  The naan was not bad.  

So while I think this place will do in a crunch for Afghan food and that the rice is delicious, I think Pamier Kabob (about 10-15 minutes north in Brampton) is better as they

a) Have a tandoori chicken special, which also includes a beef skewer
b) Bigger salad
c) but rice isn't as good as Watan.  

So if rice is your thing and you live in the area, try it out and you won't regret it.  But if meat is your thing, Pamier is better.",2

Koobideh Kebob ($6.99)
- cooked to order, fresh of the grill taste
- Mixture of grounded lamb and beef, a little gamey for my taste. The meat though is moist 

Lamb Shank ($9.99)
- Surprisingly tender and well flavoured! 
- Rice on the side is mixed with rosemary and fava beans

Portion is quite decent at this price point. We left happy and fulfilled!

7756,2,1549324800000,"The practice changed their name from Scottsdale Primary Care, and so the review I wrote previously did not carry over. I am actually LOWERING my rating for them based on continued experience with this office. I will copy my original review below, then add an update.

""I followed my doctor to this office when he relocated. At first I was really impressed, but by my third visit, not so much. 

The doctors and nurses are great, but the office support staff needs work. It is very hard to get through on the phone, and I have been put on hold more than once, and eventually hung up after extra ordinarily long wait times on hold.

Again, the doctor and nursing care I have received there has been top notch, so if you can stand the rest, this is a great office that offers same day appointments, though no weekend hours. However, for one appointment, the receptionist forgot I was there (She freely admitted that she got distracted and forgot--I was one of THREE people in the waiting area) and so I didn't get called in for my appointment until twenty minutes after my appointment time, and then I was treated as if the lady who forgot to check me in was doing me a favor by 'fitting me in'. This week, I needed a prescription refill and called on a Thursday, and while it was foolish of me to wait until I was completely out of meds, the receptionist assured me that it would be faxed to the Pharmacy that day. A trip to the pharmacy that evening proved that to be false, and by the time I was able to check into it on Friday, the office was closed and the order had still not been faxed to the pharmacy. I will have to go five days with my meds, assuming that this all gets fixed by some point on Monday.

The reception desk always seems to be seriously understaffed or under trained...I am not sure which or if it is both, but it seriously hurting their reputation to have errors like this made as often as it does.""

Now for my update...I have been out of my meds for a week because they will not do a refill request over the phone and NO ONE EVER ANSWERS THE PHONE. It is picked up by an automated service and I get treated to a recording about how they changed their name and whatnot and how very important my call is to them and someone will be with me shortly. Except it's not true. I have called them four times in the past week trying to get an appointment and have sat on hold for over 40 minutes without ever speaking to a real person. I have given up and am now planning to drive there in person to get an appointment and voice my frustration to both the office manager and my doctor. This is ridiculous! After this, I will very seriously consider seeking a new PCP even though I have been seeing this doctor for over twenty years. SO disappointed!",2

Apple Crunchy Muffin (score 3/5)
It looks very good by its appearance and really attracts me to choose it. I really love the apple meat that I could eat from the muffin, it may because I love apples, but I find it too sweet. I couldn't finish eating the whole muffin due to it is too sweet, not because I am full.

I liked everything but my party did complain that the food came out warm and wasn't hot enough. This didn't bother me since it complemented my cold papaya salad well.

7802,3,1549843200000,"Hi, T-Mobile S Rainbow! Let me give you a quick customer service 101.

HERE IS HOW YOU PROPERLY GREET AND ASSIST A CUSTOMER: ""Hello, my name is __________. How may I assist you today?""

I dropped by T-Mobile during my lunch break as a ten-year AT&T customer hoping to make the big switch. They had this huge promo going on ""switch from a carrier and get a free iPhone 7 (when you trade in your current iPhone)"". Upon every transaction, sales associates should 1) assume customers are there for the promo or 2) at least talk about the promo.

Imelda assisted me without proper above-said greeting, so she missed the whole point of why I was there and our time including a lot of backtracking and waste. I tell her I want to make the big switch, so she proceeds to activate a new line, makes me pay for a $25 SIM card, then looks at me - ""So you already have a phone for this SIM card?"" ""No, I wanted to do the free iPhone promo."" ""Oh. I saw you had two phones so I just assumed you already had a phone for me. If I knew you wanted to do the promo, I wouldn't have charged you $25 because under the promo, activating a line is free."" Huh?? Maybe if you fully questioned my needs without jumping the gun...

She then had to void the $25 transaction which for some reason she was reluctant to do. Her whole manner was rushed and lacked genuine concern when explaining things to me. When going over details of the promo, she rambled in her jargon that only phone courier sales associates who have to talk about it 100x a day would understand. She sees I do not get it, emits an exasperated sigh, then condescendingly writes on a sticky note what my options are. I have questions, and she responds to them in a nope-you-can't-do-that tone.

Ugh, the whole ordeal was so stupid. I made up in my mind that I wanted to switch from AT&T to T-Mobile and she changed that buying power in an instant. I stopped the transaction saying I'd think about my options and return after work. She said she's working there until 8pm. Hell no was I returning to her. I took my business to their Silverado location where THEIR T-Mobile associates absolutely redeemed their company's name and went above and beyond for me.

So I had the ""Marie Antoinette"" which was a cream cheese pastry with a raspberry jam on top.  Rich, but not too sweet.  I also had a ham and gruyere tartine, which was very savory.  Both of these I got to-go, because I had just eaten lunch and I wasn't sure if I'd feel like getting out of my comfy hotel bed later on.  (I was right. Future me was grateful.)

It was the end of her shift and the other waiters just left us sitting there so we had to flag down one to ask for water, but she didn't come back after that.. One lady gave us the check but we had left overs and we just sat there for a while waiting for her to come back.

7851,1,1550102400000,"This past February on my annual Super Bowl trip to Vegas, I decided to steer from my usual routine.  I stayed downtown for the first couple of nights and decided to check out Jerry's Nugget Casino and then run across the street to either the Palomino or Chicas Bonitas.

Chicas was tempting because it just looks bad and, well, I wanted to do something different.  There had to be a story I could tell walking into that joint.

Since I'm writing this review, I obviously chose the Palomino.  Last week was my third trip into this glorious establishment (always going on my first night in town) and, unless I'm fatally stabbed with a rusty screwdriver in Jerry's Nugget during future visits, I will always return until I'm too old and it's too creepy to be in there (because I'm too old).

Bottom line:  I go earlier before (I assume) the big crowds get in there.  Granted, there are never too many girls working in the late afternoon/early, early evening hours....but the number grows during the four hours I usually stay.  I like the fact there aren't too many other gents / couples when I get there and I like the fact that there aren't too many girls, actually.  The three times I've gone in there, I've been lucky enough that one/two of the ladies that were in there were keepers and we hung out my entire visit.

Lisa, Juliet, KK, and Talia...all sweethearts, never pushy at all, great to talk to, no implants, very natural.  The whole totally nude thing is wonderful, don't get me wrong, but the fact that I have yet to encounter a surgically implanted girl (in one way or another) here is a HUGE plus in my book.  It also helps that I have never-ever felt like the these girls were trying to expedite my wallet from my David Bitton-Bufflao jeans and then my Ben Franklins/Andrew Jackson's from that wallet.  In the end, that's the idea and I get that...but I've never felt any pressure in this place in that regard.

The VP area is very reasonable.  It's private (unlike other establishments).  The drinks are even reasonable, all things considered.

The fact that last week Talia told me the boss was into heavy metal made it even more attractive to me.  I had tears in my eyes.  This place is like a National Park.

The only negative thing that happened to me in the vicinity was when I couldn't get a cab from the joint back in April because there were a dozen conventions going on in town.  Transportation was hard to come by and I waited outside for a cab (that the lovely maiden working the front desk called for me)...and waited...and waited.

I know NLV is not the safest of places, but I said, 'screw it' and started walking back to Fremont Street.  I got about 1/4 mile up LV Blvd before a cop pulled over and asked what I was doing.  He said, ""You're a high roller if you're walking back there in this area.  You don't want to be doing that""  He gave me a lift.

I certainly don't blame the Palomino for no cabs.  I say it was the only negative because if I was mugged and thrown into a drainage ditch somewhere, I'd never be able to visit the Taj Mahal of Gentlemen's Clubs again.

See you again in February.",2

This saved me the cost of an unnecessary eye exam  When I arrived the store was clean, well stocked with a wide selection of frames in a variety of price ranges. The staff was courteous and helpful without being ""pushy"". 
  My service person was 'Shaun' and he exceeded my expectations in all areas. He was very helpful, attentive, tuned right in to what I wanted and he kept me from selecting frames I would have been unhappy with. I had told him what features I wanted and inadvertently selected frames that didn't meet my criteria. Shaun pointed out the difference and I happily made the change.

7859,1,1550448000000,"Let me preface this review by saying that as a vegan, I never expect that restaurants that don't advertise vegan options will go out of their way to accommodate my dietary choices. However, Coca Cafe indicates several menu options as being able to be made vegan. 

I ordered the vegan version of the Breakfast Sandwich, which is ordinarily served with over easy eggs, fresh avocado, apple smoked bacon and house kimchi on sourdough bread. To make this dish vegan required the replacement of the bread, replacement of the eggs, and removal of the meat (note: their soy sausage is vegetarian but not vegan). 

What I received (after 45 minutes of waiting) was two fairly uncooked, unseasoned slabs of tofu on dry whole wheat toast with a smudge of avocado and kimchi on one side, with a side of unripe honey dew. My sandwich (and fruit) was completely devoid of flavor. I would have sent it back, but anticipated any replacement would have been similarly bland. Other local vegan-friendly restaurants will often add additional ingredients or at least some seasoning to dishes that lose a large amount of flavor due to the removal/substitution of primary ingredients, but this sandwich just felt like a lazy afterthought.

The two guests I was eating with ordered the (non-vegan version) Breakfast Sandwich and Pancetta Omelet respectively, both of which turned out to be disappointingly tasteless as well. 

Again, I do not ever expect that a restaurant will really work to cater to my strict diet unless specified, but to suggest an abundance of vegan-friendly menu options and get this was just disheartening. Would not recommend to vegans and omnivores alike.",2

I took the family to Vegas for a weekend getaway and South Point offered the best value. Yeah it's off the strip but it's fine if you drive here because you could just take the 5 minute drive in if you choose to. This hotel is beautiful inside and out. It doesn't feel all used and abused. It's very family friendly. They have a bowling alley, a movie theater, an equestrian center, an arcade, and all the other things you'd expect from a Vegas hotel; the casino, a spa, fitness center, barber shop, and pools. There's the main pool, a kiddie pool, and a jacuzzi. There is a daily fee for the fitness center,though, wack.
 
The room was nice and clean, 500 sq. ft., the bathroom was big and had a door separating the bathtub from the vanity, which is awesome, right? I also had a view of the pool.

The main floor has something like 9 restaurants, a few of which I did eat at. Also, the bowling alley has a snack bar that serves pizza, hot dogs, nachos, that type of thing.
There was something wrong with the elevators while I was here, not sure if it happens all the time, but, there were only two of the six elevators working; kind of inconvenient.

They say it's a plate for 4, but they only give you about 8 small portions of bread, so I would say this can easily be for 2-3 people. 4 is stretching it, but the mortadella is fantastic on this plate. Calamari was also quite delectable, but we didn't stay for anything other than a few drinks. Aureole awaited. Be warned, you're in Vegas, and you're at Lupo, so a hefe is going to cost you $11.

7935,3,1551312000000,"This review does have a happy ending...really.

Last Monday I decided I needed new tires for my car. After a little online shopping I decided on Discount Tire and gave them a call. Since I was heading out of town Tuesday and Wednesday I made an appointment for Thursday at 8:00 AM.

I arrived about 40 minutes late, but had called ahead to let them know and when they checked me in they said it wasn't a problem. After asking for the car to be done by noon and being assured it would be ready I was on my way back to the office.

12:30 PM comes and I gave the store a call to confirm the car was ready and was told it was all set. I had one of my friends come and give me a ride to Discount Tire. 

I usually don't check the work, but today something struck me to take a look at the car before I went inside. Low and behold the car hadn't moved since I dropped it off in the morning. I went inside and stood in line and when I was finally waited on I brought the situation to their attention. 

Unfortunately I needed my car for afternoon appointments and couldn't wait any longer even though they offered to get it in right away and get it done in 15 minutes.

I left the store extremely upset as I had planned on leaving on vacation the next day and was out of time to get the tires. When I got back to the office I decided to give them a call and wound up speaking to an Assistant Mgr. 

Ultimately he offered to pick up my car and bring it back to me which was the best solution they could have offered. I really appreciated it.

Before this experience I would have given Discount Tire 4 or 5 stars and in the end they made it right. I just wish they would have done the work when they were supposed to.",2

You walk in and you feel you're more in a sports bar/English pub than a Chinese restaurant. The hostess seats you and then you're not served for 10 minutes. Eventually a server comes by and takes your order. I got the hot & sour soup and the eggplant w/chicken. I then proceeded to wait for 15 minutes before the soup arrived. The waitress was a little frenzied when she brought the soup and then disappeared again before I could ask her for some hot sauce.  I flagged down a busser for it instead, and he seemed pretty annoyed that I asked him to do something beyond wiping off tabletops. The soup was decent but it wasn't nearly the best that I've had.

I then waited another 15 minutes before got my entree. The eggplant tasted alright, but the ground chicken it was mixed with was downright disgusting. Smelled and tasted completely rotten. After four spoonfuls I decided I couldn't eat it anymore. But my waitress was nowhere to be found. I then spotted her from across the way and gave the ""I'd like my check"" hand signal. I then waited for 15 more minutes. I didn't see my waitress anywhere. I walked up to the hostess and ask for my check. She gave me my bill and asked if I want to pack the food for home, to which I declined. 

I pay and leave the place, and see that my waitress is hanging out at the bus stop. Apparently her shift was over and she was going home, but I was left sitting there at the booth with a plate of smelly ground chicken and a mood of anger something large.

I'm really hoping this isn't the ""best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix"" because the service sucked donkey balls and the food was nowhere near good enough to make up for it. If there aren't any excellent Chinese restaurants in Phoenix, then I'm going to forlorn. Very forlorn. And that's not a good thing.",2

I have always loved having a neighbourhood Shoppers and having one close to home is usually on my list of apartment hunting criteria. When I moved into the Upper Avenue neighbourhood I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is the 'organic Shoppers' of Toronto. It's like having a combination of the Big Carrot, Whole Foods and a Shoppers all in one store... 

They carry mainly organic/health food & natural cosmetics, other unique items and including a pharmacy. I can find stuff here, such as non-GMO Morinaga smoothie-grade soft tofu, that is hard to find elsewhere in the area (I only like this brand for making chocolate pudding!) I also found a favourite Burts Bees product here that I haven't been able to find at other Shoppers locations. Plus they have a great essential oils collection that seems to get a little bigger each time I check for new oils.

UPDATE - Sept 2014: This Shoppers is currently completing a major renovation and product offering change.

7979,3,1549065600000,"Amazing brunch, combinations were delicious, well thought-out as the flavours complimented each other, and eat plate was crafted masterfully. Has the brunch sucre (sweet) and brunch toscan (savoury) and both were perfect, especially to share to satisfy both senses! The brunch sucre was also not overly sweet. Portions didn't seem overwhelming but filling, the food felt very fresh, light and refreshing however.

It's a tad expensive for brunch, but worth the experience. Service was attentive and bilingual! It's a place that quite packed, so don't be surprised of the wait or needing to sit with other people at a table!

Would recommend to go to in Montreal and easily could go back if I get the chance!",1

7989,1,1550188800000,"Best Italian veal sandwich I've had in a long time. Made fresh to order. I was told I got the last two veals of the day (they close at 7pm) and had I wanted 3 sandwiches I would have been out of luck. Fine with me. I like to know the food doesn't sit around.

The bun was fresh, the veal hot and crispy but tender inside, and the tomato sauce was full of flavour (definitely made in-house). Hot peppers added more than a little zip. Very satisfying. Friendly, fast service. There are a few stools and a narrow counter to eat at but it's mainly a take-out joint.",2
8021,2,1551225600000,"Fanciest Chinese food I have ever had in Vegas. This place was hands down excellent. The presentation was spot on with every dish we ordered.

The best part of my meal was the dessert tray that came out. Every piece was perfectly ripe just to my liking. Not that it was the only great tasting thing on the menu, everything we ordered was full flavored, the service was superb as well.

My new go to place to impress people for real Chinese food in Vegas.",2
8025,3,1550534400000,I needed a general inspection on my dads car to make sure he is safe on the road.

Definitely recommend it!,2
8026,3,1549497600000,"What happened?  Have eaten here 7+\- times and ALWAYS enjoyed...till this last time. We got the pork tenderloin and it just was not as flavorful as it was in the past. The tamale was dry and also flavorless.  Service was okay, but not the top notch as it was in the past.
This used to be our favorite, gotta eat here every time in Vegas place, but not anymore",2
8031,2,1550275200000,"We have been to Haymaker a few times now, once for dinner and a few times for breakfast. I prefer their breakfast over dinner.

We went on a Thursday night for their burger special. My husband thought his burger was tasty. I had the veggie burger and I was underwhelmed. I thought the fries were just average.

We both have never been disappointed in the breakfast. I had their Florentine Benedict every time and I think it is very tasty. I love the hollandaise sauce and the English muffin. Their breakfast potatoes aren't the greatest. Definitely tastes like they were frozen and they have come out undercooked. Not bad, but not good.

Service has always been great. Friendly and attentive. We will be back again and again for breakfast and to try their happy hour.",2
8038,3,1550188800000,"Beautiful restaurant, excellent service, disappointing food. I had the salmon, which was well well done (they didn't ask for a temp). Came with 4 beet chunks and a spoonful of parsnip purée. Way under seasoned, and no salt on the table. Other entrees were also meh, with the exception of the steak melt sandwich, which got rave reviews from my slightly drunk gma. 

Server was excellent, but the kitchen just wasn't on their game.",1
8044,3,1551139200000,"I really appreciate Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza. After all, the pizza is simply good. The crust is thin and perfect and the bites are elegantly simple. Some of the specialty pizzas are conceived somewhat strangely. For instance, the arugula pizza just comes with arugula piled on top and dusted with some parmesan, so it's really an arugala salad atop a piece of excellent cheese pizza. While this might be peculiar, it certainly doesn't invoke a complaint. The wings are roasted and they are very good, although not necessarily what one might expect.",3
8046,1,1551139200000,First time here. We had a large group so we called ahead. Both the service and food were excellent. The seafood pancake and the homemade dumplings (steamed and fried) were great. I ordered the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bob which is served in a hot stone pot. This is great with the red pepper paste. I definitely recommend this place and will go again.,2
8047,3,1550793600000,"Mediocre.

We came here to see Darrell (who was the manager at the King West location...has since moved to the York Street location) he always makes the dining experience exceptional. Sadly he was not in... maybe he would have saved the evening!

On to dinner: The server was relatively quick on the drink orders. And because we were regulars we know our orders relatively quickly. No real connection was made...but Melanie did her job well enough off the hop. I did have to ask another server to send her our way. And the couple next to us who arrived prior to us received their mains as we left. I over heard them say ""well I guess we have nothing else to do tonight"" 

My food: quite lacking! Sadly. I only ordered the tuna tartar (my usual). The fried wontons were cold and stale. I told our server who said a manager would bring out the replacement...I'd imagine to do a table touch...this didn't happen. One of the line cooks did. Fine. There was a visible difference in appearance between the two. Obviously the first set were older/possibly refrigerated. I was satisfied with the replacement wontons. THEN I BIT INTO THE HARD BIT OF THE END OF AN AVOCADO! like the stem circle bit. I didn't even complain about it. I just quit eating. 

My husband said the filet mignon was good. Standard keg.",2
8057,3,1549324800000,"Pita Paradise hasn't been open long. They actually may have only been open a few months, but I'm not sure.  The location of this restaurant is primo.  They're right in the middle of Desert Ridge, close to the movie theaters and other stores.  

The atmosphere is nice and the food is mediterranean.  Pita's, gyros, falafel, kebabs etc, can be found on the menu.  The time I went, it was pretty busy in there.  It was around lunch time, but the servers still managed to hold it together.  

But the time of day just doesn't matter with Desert Ridge.  No matter when you go, it will always be busy.  I've always wondered why too. How can that many people be shopping during the day?  Don't these people have jobs? Anyways, so my guess is that Pita Paradise will probably always be a little busy, but the food is good, so check it out.",2

Coffee is always tasty and hot regardless of the time I stop in. Only drawback is that I love my coffee with a packet of Sweet N Low.

8089,3,1549152000000,"I will never forget my experience here. In fact, my husband will probably have to tell me to shut up about it. Although we had some issues getting there, Andrew was so accommodating and wonderful. All the staff were, but Andrew quickly put a smile on my face. Once inside, there was much more to smile about. 

After reading some reviews about the ladies not approaching couples, I was a little wary, but my husband and I did not have that problem at all. I think it's all about attitude. If you show the ladies love and don't have a sourpuss face, they will love you back. A warning to couples: if you don't think you will have a good time together, just don't go. 

My husband and I had a ridiculously killer night. We got the Two Of A Kind package and got a great table. The ladies came over and sat on my lap and talked to us. We picked out girls for each other to get dances from and most of our dances were with the two of us together. 

This place is a feast for the eyes. Mostly natural bodies are abundant and appreciated. Lots of different looks and plenty of gorgeous, sexy women. We got dances from Jennifer, Styla, Avery, Chloe, and Sunny. I have nothing but great things to say about all of them, but Sunny was incredible. They were considerate and friendly and just a hell of a lot of fun. 

I am down to check out other clubs, but the Palomino will always have a special place in my heart. It's going to be impossible to avoid coming back any time we're in Vegas. Over four hours there and I don't regret one minute of it. A damn good time. Thanks again Andrew for making it happen!",2
8090,1,1550966400000,I ordered a vegan veggie burger and it came out with a bun that previously had cheese on it and someone unsuccessfully attempted to rip the cheese off the bun and then they just put it back on my veggie burger.

8090,3,1550707200000,"What a great experience! Me and my date came here on a weekend trip to Montreal. Knowing this place was probably booked solid, I got the DINR app and sure enough spotted a reservation for two.

Our waiter was hilarious and made the whole meal so enjoyable. They also start you off with some bread and onion butter that was delicious! 

The waiter boasted the olde fashioned which my date got and thoroughly enjoyed. My Sauvignon blanc was great with my meal. 

We stared off with the jerk crab which we were told is the only dish that has stayed on the menu throughout the entire 11 years the restaurant has been open! It was delicious but my date who wasn't used to peeling and eating crab found it messy and hard to eat. However, I loved it! 

For mains, I had the scallop and pork belly in BBQ sauce. Presentation was on point. This was the most delicious thing ever, the scallops were cooked perfectly and paired so well with the pork belly and the corn it was on. Portion was small which is my only negative point, I just wished there was more for how much it cost. 

We ended off the meal with the peanut butter and chocolate sauce puff pastry, this was okay but my date loved it! 

What a great evening, would 100% return on my next Montreal visit!",2

They did a great job refurbishing the place.  It is clean and there is some eat-in dining space. Campus Grille keeps some SERIOUS late hours for those on campus so it is great for carry out! 

If you're in Berea, check out Campus Grille!",2
8099,2,1549756800000,"We stopped by Rice Paper a few months ago for a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie at the Phoenix Film Bar. Looking for something exotic, inexpensive, fast and within a 10 minute drive to our final destination, we brought up Yelp! on my phone and searched for nearby restaurants. 

I love Vietnamese food. So much so, that when I lived in California and I would go back east to visit my family, I would drive an hour in rush hour traffic in Arlington, VA to go to my absolute favorite Vietnamese place called Cafe Dalat. Anyone familiar with traffic in the DC area knows this restaurant must have been amazing to suffer a voluntary 2 hour commute and it was. Alas, Cafe Dalat has since closed and that is a different story for a different day.

Pulled over on the side of the road and huddled over the phone, we saw that there was a new, modern Vietnamese place within a few minutes drive and that had great reviews and our minds were made up. 

The restaurant is a small but well designed coverted store front house on 7th Street in downtown Phoenix.  Although they specialize in spring rolls and fresh rice paper rolls, they also offer a selection of pho (soup), goi (salad), bahn-mi (sandwiches) as well as a few mini entrees. If you get 2-3 rolls per person and share a soup or mini entree, you'll be full by the time you leave. The service is pleasant, knowlegable and efficient. The bathrooms are unisex. The seating is cozy and intimate- think party of 2 or 4 rather than 6-8 although if you get there early enough, there is a bar style table in the middle of the restaurant that can seat around 6 people. 

As for the rolls, my favorite were the crispy ""Budda"" and the fresh veggie tempura soft rice paper roll. If you are looking for a meat filled roll, try a traditional pork or grilled chicken with basil roll served with hoisin sauce. 

The last time we went, I think we ordered crispy calimari and lemon grass chicken with garlic noodles; both great. We were sitting next to a woman and her daughter who were both eating Pho and the fragrance of it was so amazing that I had to ask them how it was. The mother said that it was some of the best Pho in town and if it wasn't 115 in August, we probably would have ventured to try some. 

At around $15-20 per person including a cocktail (they have great HH prices too), this was definitely a modern take on some Vietnamese classics.",1
8106,1,1550793600000,"I've only been here for Happy Hour, so I can't talk about the crazy party atmosphere, which I've heard really good things about.  The service was great when I was there, as were the food and drinks.  Really nice patio to enjoy a relaxing evening with friends.",2

8118,2,1551225600000,"I was in Toronto for a concert with my mother and a few girl friends, and we desperately wanted a nice lake front patio with some seafood.

Pier 4 seemed to be the only place that fit the bill, so we ventured inside.   To get to the patio you have to walk through kitschy, dank smelling pirate and ocean knickknacks.   I would not want to eat inside, it smelled terrible.

The patio was lovely, and the server although a bit strange, was polite and did his job with relative aptitude.

Why anyone wouldn't order seafood at a seafood place is just ridiculous, so of course I ordered the catch of the day - and it was delicious, not memorable, but a good bite to eat,   My friend ordered crab cakes, and they were mediocre.

Overall, the patio was exactly what I wanted, but the food was nothing special.",2

-Pâtes déjà cuite en commandant. Donnant le résultat de pâtes séchés qui ont imbibé toute l'eau de la sauce donnant un plat difficile à manger (les pâtes se tenaient d'elles même en boule)
-Sauce sorti tout droit du réfrigérateur (qui ne goûte pas extraordinaire).
-Français? Non. On préfère me laisser parler avec les cuisiniers d'un anglais douteux. (J'ai dû insister? en plus pour avoir une fourchette en plastique pour le travail)
-Accompagnement? Meilleur chance la prochaine fois. (Ou pas) on me sert un spaghetti Alfredo sans oignon, bacon, poivre, ou toute chose qui aurais pu le rendre juste acceptable. C'était tout simplement sans goût.

En résumé : un spaghetti sauce blanche trop cher pas bon.",2

Daughter's Chicken Strips, oddly enough, are by far the best tasting, highest quality, great portioned meal (along with generous helping of steak fries) in any restaurant, MExican or otherwise.  Son's taco combo and my own salad both absolutely solid in their selection.

I spoke to Ed and told him what the situation was and what needed to be done because my grandmother not only needed the heavy items moved but she needed boxes and someone to pack her up before the move. Ed asked a lot of questions so that he could give the most accurate estimate. I appreciated his honesty. I also read reviews on various sites which were all great. I scheduled the move one week out. Ed gave me a call the day before to confirm as promised.  After talking to my grandmother and the staff at the facility they had nothing but amazing things to say about the movers. I was told they were on time, respectful, and very accommodating. My grandmother was very pleased and said they went above and beyond to help her. I was nervous prior to the move because I couldn't be there so I didn't know what to expect; I am very glad to have found these guys.

We put in our name on a list and what we do in Chicago is wait outside until they find us.  But you can see there's a queue so after like 20 mins I got in line and bingo! we were seated.  I don't know if it was timing or if we should have been in the line all this time.
Its a little on the pricey side but one breakfast should be a splurge, right?  We all started w/ mimosas which were great but not for me.  I cannot stand pulp.  I know I'm a weirdo.  I'd rather have Tang than fresh squeezed.  It was too chunky for me but I'm sure everyone else loved it.  I had coffee which was very good.  I got an almond croissant to start/share.  It was amazing!!  We also wanted some cheese so we got the $8 plate which was all good stuff.  I had the goat cheese scramble on toast.  I was so homey and comforting!  They do not skimp on the cheese!  I would have loved more bread but the other diners had extra so no biggie.  They both got this meaty, beany,  cowboy skillet which must have been great.  For a good 10 mins none of us were talking!

The crowd was pretty good-looking and everyone was dressed pretty nice.  When I was there the music was pretty good.

The chicken with boursin cheese and potatoes were great. We had a tray of small squares for dessert. There was a birthday in our group and some staff brought out ice cream and sang which was a nice touch. Games were super fun and it wasn't busy at all. Overall the place is really clean and big. I would definitely return.,2

We waited for 40 minutes for dinner and went again for a late lunch the very next day (that's how much my parents love this place)!  Service is good; they also have a good variety of food and drinks. The only downside is that it doesn't have any two tops, which I believe causes some extra wait time... Changing the table mix (if possible) might help both the customers and the restaurant.",2

Other than that,  its perfect from the service to the sushi!  My favorite is the nigiri & pork belly!  Their nigiri is really fresh, perfectly cut, and has a small amount of rice in it.  They also allow half rolls on the 8 pcs rolls, so you can try a variety of rolls if you want!

The ordering system is different. You are given a book and you write what orders you want down. And then rip the pages off and give that to a server. Wish we had instructions cause we were confused at first.

The decor is really pretty, keeps you occupied while you're waiting for food. 

The rolls were really good. Lots of unique items . Loved the mango rolls. There were a good amount of vegetarian options but not so much unique vege options. just the standard avocado and cucumber rolls. They had lots of yummy desserts.",2

We had never been there, but it was recommended by someone at a different restaurant because we needed a nice but still casual place near the Diamondback Stadium.. (It is walking distance and great parking right across the street) This place was AWESOME!! They had our table set outside on their patio, which was perfect because the weather was just right. I honestly can't say enough about this place.. Started the evening with our waiter (Brent) He was very attentive to all our guest and had a smile the entire time!  He made sure everyone in our party had a drink in hand at all times, whether it was a cocktail/or ice tea. (excellent drinks by the way) We also ordered different appetizers, from the cheese platter to zucchini fritters & crispy shrimp. For dinner we all ordered something different. I had the grilled salmon, husband had the baby back ribs. Everyone's dinner came out quickly and nicely prepared. (the food was really really good) Our Waiter continuously checked on us to make sure everyone was doing ok. The level of service at this place is a 10+ There is NOT one bad thing I can say.. Our guest are still raving about this night. Grad dinner was a complete success! Thank you Brent, and The Arrogant Butcher!",2
8332,1,1550188800000,"I recently spent my second day in as many years at Spa Lamar, but this time for extended services.  All tolled, I was there for 6 hours: from an early yoga session masterfully led by Lisa Valle, who wove mind/body/spirit into the one hour and 15 minute practice, to a chocolate-peppermint body scrub, then an added-on facial (as I was happy to remain in the company and expert hands of Natalie, the asethetician), to lunch and the finaly service of the day - a pedicure that included extensive defolliation and leg/foot massage. 

The staff members I encountered were all professional and extremely courteous.  I felt welcome and pampered.  The services were simultaneously relaxing and invigorating.  Peaceful. 

The facility is conveniently located on Scottsdale Rd. with ample parking by the entrance, which is behind the main thoroughfare making for easy access.  However, the interior looks ready for an rejuvination of its own - the painting and furnishings are dated, the towels worn and frayed.  Same for the small poolside area.  

There are many selections one can chose for lunch upon checking in. My choice was a salad, which was set out for me in the main dining/lounging area after my tacked-on  facial request (I do have to commend the staff for being so accommodating) and was sent in a plastic container from a local, well-established take-out deli.  The fresh-baked cookie dessert was served to me warm on a plate during my pedicure, making for a nice touch to the otherwise standard fare. 

Living in Scottsdale, I've had the pleasure and opportunity to sample many of the amazing spas in the local resorts.  The ambiance at such establishments certainly out-shines that of the Spa Lamar, but in terms of services provided I would definitely say they're on par, at a cost that is somewhat less than the finer establishments.",2

Visited different locations before, and I have to tell you, this location is the best.  The manager knows her menu very well, and I'm happy that she didn't miss any items on our order.  Their staffs are very helpful, too.

Very fresh seafood~!!  I love their mussels the most.  Shrimps, Lobster, and Snow Crab Legs are also very good too.  Four different flavours and I love them all.  You can choose your heat level... but for me... I only can have non spicy or mild... haha~! 

Must order their Fried Shrimp Basket and you can change the fries to their Cajun fries~~~ Love it~!!

The menu has some of the same offerings as J'eet did, with many new additions as well. Notably, the espresso machine and coffees have returned. Mike had the Elvis crepe (banana, peanut butter, and BACON!), I had one with spiced applesauce, caramel, and walnuts. The crepes themselves were excellent, just the right texture and the flavor spot on. I love the new crepe offerings, can't wait to try them, plus there is a French toast menu which is a great idea.

We chatted with the new owner for a bit, he's a really interesting and friendly guy and he makes good food for sure, so we'll definitely return!",2

Cucumber and tomato were fresh & especially enjoyed pickled  cabbage. The combination Pho had tender and flavorful tendon, steak, flank, brisket & tripe in a flavorful broth, which I enjoyed all of it. Most Pho broths at other restsurants are too salty to finish; just would suggest serving with warmer temperature so it stays hot through the meal. Basil and bean sprouts were  fresh & crispy. Rice and vermicelli were cooked just right and everything served in generous quantity.",3
8379,2,1549756800000,"Let me preface this by saying I enjoy dining at upscale restaurants.  Additionally, when I planned my Las Vegas trip, I knew I wanted to eat at a celebrity chef's restaurant (or two...).  Seeing as how Bobby Flay is one of my all-time favorites, it was pretty evident that Mesa would be the restaurant I wanted to choose.  Not to mention, I've heard and read great things about it.  

I had called earlier in the afternoon to make reservations for that evening and was excited to hear that they had a few reservations available for a Saturday night (12/1).  However, I was attending a show at 10pm and the two reservations available were 5:30 and 8:30.  The hostess who answered the call was kind enough to tell me that the 8:30 time slot was going to be cutting it close for us and informed me that we could dine at the bar, with a full menu.  I thanked her and figured those were my plans.

The restaurant ambiance is awesome.  The table layout gives each party their own little area to feel cozy, but not alone in the restaurant.  The vibe is energetic and hip.  

Upon arrival, we told the hostess that we were planning to dine at the bar because the wait for a table was 45-50 minutes.  She pointed out that a few specific guests sitting at the bar would be leaving to go to their table shortly.  I appreciated the tip.  Within maybe 15 minutes, the seats became available and we hopped up to the bar.  

The bartender greeted us and I didn't order a specialty drink, but my Ketel martini was made perfectly. 

I had already eaten a lot earlier that day, so I ended up only ordering an entree: Black Florida Grouper.  My expectations were extremely high for this restaurant and unfortunately, the entree fell short.  My grouper was way overcooked.  It was tough and it didn't flake at all.  It was dry, but some of the sauce made up for that.  The flavor was definitely there -- the execution was not.  My friend ordered the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno, which she said was delicious.  

Additionally, being that I work in the service industry, I do not complain a lot and chose not to with this dish.  But I was very disappointed when our bartender didn't even ask how our dishes were.  In fact, we were pretty much ignored for most of the meal after our entrees were dropped.  I had to ask for the check myself after my empty entree plate sat in front of me for 10-15 minutes.  

All in all, the food was mediocre and the service was as well. The only positive notes were the helpful hostesses.  Very disappointing for me to say the least, especially since this was the one part of the trip I was looking forward to.",2
8389,1,1550793600000,"How fun?! The bartender was super nice and knowledgeable. The few of us had no idea what to order or drink or which route to go. He helped the boys navigate through their first absinthe drip. I stuck to a simple apple whiskey cocktail, which was very delicious. 
Whether you hate whiskey, or have no idea, or love whiskey. There is something for everyone, they also have some bottle beer you can get if you are not a fan of all their other great offerings. It is located inside the William Penn Hotel and it super easy to find. They do not serve food, but it is a nice spot to start your daily adventure or maybe for a night cap.",2

Playing deal or no deal.  It only cost one token.  Peter piper is 4 tokens.  The exact same game.  We had a large pepperoni.   15.00 dollars very over priced.

Head to the bar where I'm greeted with a super unfriendly bartender who- right off the bat, instead of hello, I get a bristly l ""do you need a drink menu?""... Maybe she had been having a bad day?

Where can you find Imperial beer, other than Costa Rica, Bevmo...Ticoz.
I only had time for calamari but it was prepared nicely with two sauces, the guacamole/jalenpeno sauce was not that hot but tasted good, the other one was sort of a marinara. 

The menu looks simialr to Southwester/Mexican, not the dishes that I have had in Costa Rica at all but I like that that they they have the idea of Costa Rica in Phoenix. Where is the Tarrazu coffee? you can find it at Wildflower but they don't spell it correctly.

Altough the owners are not from Costa Rica, Plantains with smashed black beans would have been nice to see on the menu, you can find those authentic type dishes at Havanah cafe, but ""no tiene de que qujarse.""

I like the music and ambiance, the bar has convenient seating for a group, and not just tables and chairs. The wait staff is very attentive, but should have told me the happy hour specials as I was alone with my computer and ended up paying full price for a beer and appetizer at a dead time of  the day.

I think that  I'll have to bring my husband to try the paella (even though I should go to an Authentic Spanish place) and  get his take on the menu, he's a Costa Rican.

I'm looking for a place that has good chimichuri sauce, if anyone knows, please let me know. The last time I had great South american food was a place called Inferno in La Jolla, CA but they are now a new restaurant.

The apple jam and rosemary butter were amazing. 

Their chicken and waffles were great. It came with two fried chicken and 3 small waffles and maple syrup and powdered sugar. The fried chicken had a good crust that was well seasoned and was still crispy with the syrup. I have never had such good fried chicken, especially one that was boneless. The waffles were not flabby and were structurally intact with the maple syrup.

My friend loved the pollo frito. It came with a fried chicken, egg, pulled pork, and sauce. It was very spicy and the sauce had a good kick to it. I liked it more than the chicken and waffles due to the flavor.

The tee time was refreshing, but not too strong.

8565,3,1551312000000,"We travelled all the way from Tucson, AZ for a laparoscopic spay procedure for our sweetie pup, Elsa.  This vet does them on a regular basis and the price was very reasonable.  We couldn't find anyone in AZ who does them this inexpensively.

After many email exchanges and a phone consult with the vet who would do the surgery, we made an appointment. All of our communication was easy via email, however calling the office was not the best way to confirm a coupe of things; the front desk staff were a bit chaotic and not as knowledgeable as I would expect.

We were in the office for an hour during Elsa's intake.  I think we waited a total of 1/2 hour for the doc and the vet tech.  Everyone was super friendly and the office is clean, beautiful and very relaxing.  

When she woke up, we got a call to let us know she made it through surgery perfectly and were informed of our pickup time.  They made sure she was fully awake and able to walk before releasing her.

Picking her up took about 1/2 hour with the post-op consult and payment.  Very easy and exactly what we were quoted for a uncomplicated surgery.

The only surprise was not being told the extent of the shaving they have to do for a Lap Spay procedure.  It was shown on the consent form, but I didn't see it (distracted by my calming dog!) and no one mentioned it.  Be prepared for a ""Mohawk"" shave!

I would recommend this clinic without reservation!   

Elsa had some slight swelling a few days after the surgery, but we emailed a pic and one of the vets confirmed that it was normal, due to the stitiches.

This place had been on our list for years and we finally made down there. Now, I had no idea who the hell this guy from the Food Network is, but he knows a good meal when he finds one. We worked our way down to lower Greenfield to this old-school neighborhood bar and restaurant and dove in. There's always this little nervousness of being made to feel like an outsider in this kind of place, but not only was our welcome from our waiter warm and helpful, the folks seated around us were engaging and enthusiastic, making menu suggestions, cracking jokes. It was like we'd been invited into someone's house for a holiday dinner.

I got the Chicken Parm, which is literally a couple of pounds of moist, delicately breaded and fried chicken breast covered in delicious sauce and served on a bed of spaghetti. I'm a big guy who likes to eat, and it took a dedicated effort to finish half of my plate. A young man of 18 in our party, a broad-shouldered defensive tackle with a deeply ambitious attitude, was likewise stalled by his Veal parm sandwich which, it is true, is literally served on a full loaf of italian bread. The thing was bigger than his head. Literally. Mrs. Junk ordered the Reuben, which was delightful, while our final diner sat down to the insanely large and delicious calzone. 

This isn't a birdseed joint--this is big food with big bold taste, served up hot and fresh in a place where everyone was happy and friendly. There should be more places like this in a world too full of strip-mall generic places like Chilis and Fridays. This is the real deal.

I note a negative review from someone who is whining about waiting for a table and dissing Greenfield, a solid working class neighborhood, as ""shady"" and I just want to say that those words are an insult. Greenfield might not be Lawrenceville or (thank god) the trendy mess that hipsters have made of East Liberty, but it is a safe and welcoming place where folks raise their families.

At this point I was pretty bummed since I could tell this wasn't green chile that was used at all, halfway through I'm cutting into the tortilla to get the chicken out & I found a hair inside of it. They were very sweet & refunded my money as well as offered to make me something else but at that point I had lost my appetite.

Yet there are very few Filipino restaurants even though there is a huge Filipino population.  This place opened up in the Heartland Town Centre food area (i.e. Britannia and Latimer Road).  

Decor: 3/5 - very clean and modern

Service: 2.5/5 - I came here during it's first week and there were a few kinks, which almost had me running out the door.  While the cashier was very friendly, I was very apprehensive when I saw someone cleaning the place with a mop at around 5:30 pm.  I figure most cleaning should be done at around 2-4 pm, when it's not prime eating time.  The second thing was that when I ordered a combo, it took the cashier a while to figure out why their POS (point of sale) device wasn't sending the order to the kitchen.  She then had to be told since it was a ""combo"", there's no need.  Despite these two hiccups (which would scare me off if it were a long standing establishment), the cashier was very helpful in explaining what everything was. 

Food: 3.5/5 - okay I don't remember what I ordered.  I believe it was chicken and pork adobo and some type of pork ""sausage"" with rice.  The adobo tasted like a sweet curry chicken, which I thought was okay.  However, I really loved the pork ""sausage"".  I wish I could describe or compare it to something, but I can't.  It was a good mix of sweet and salty. In addition, the rice was very fragrant. 

Verdict:  It's very different than Chinese, Thai, and Indian food.  It's not spicy.  But it has similar curries but sweet.  Try it out.  Seems like it's good for takeout and would be great hangover food too.",2

To no one's surprise, I ordered the Chiliquiles Rojas. To this day, I still crave the Chiliquiles Verdes from Gallo Blanco, so I was just dying to find out how different or similar the taste would be. To tell you the truth, I couldn't really tell much difference, because I really loved the Chiliquiles Rojas. It definitely had some spice to it, but not the type that you can't handle. It's just packed with the right about of flavor and punch. 

The Huevos Rancheros had a similar sauce but different enough that if you wanted to try both, they'd almost complement each other in a way. This one had no meat though. I personally like having protein, so I ordered my Chiliquiles with chicken. 

We also ordered a side of Quesadilla Synchronizada, which is actually just a cheese quesadilla with Oaxacan cheese. 

Funny enough, even though I took Spanish for so many years, I am embarrassed to say that I asked what the Verderas Crudas was. My particular menu did not say the translation directly beneath. The waitress just looked at me questioningly and politely answered, ""Those are fresh vegetables."" Ah, but of course! Of course, I wouldn't know what veggies in Spanish was. I am a meatatarian. Veggies only get in my way! None of that green stuff for me! Perhaps it was just the scrumptious Bloody Mary taking hold of me and made me forget, but regardless, we enjoyed our brief time eating here. (Yes, I mean brief as in, we were hungry and ate quickly and the service was efficient and great!)",3
8681,1,1551052800000,"We went here on a fluke as the place we wanted to go had a long wait.  This place didn't have one and now we know why.   The owner or manager was rude to us from the start. We were seated then ignored for about 10 mins.  We started to look at yelp and looking for other options as we were ready to just leave since we weren't being served.  The manager picked up on our conversation and proceeded to tell his wait staff to get over to us NOW.  We finally got a waitress, and proceeded to order.  First of all they charge for bread.  Regular or garlic.  Which is fine. But they offer it like it's free and then there is the fact that it is stale and awful.  The portions were small.  The flavor was eh.  And the service was bad.  I also noticed the manager cleaning a table, putting his fingers in the dirty glasses, then going over and making roll ups of silver ware.  I watched as he touched the tongs on the forks with his dirty hands.  That alone is reason enough for me to NEVER go back.  Basically just an awful experience.  And no wonder there was no wait at 7:30pm on a Friday night.",2

So I get to my appointment and Marcus Pace comes into the room and immediately recognizes it as a Seborrheic Keratosis. Then he removes it 5 minutes later and it was painless.

8692,2,1551225600000,"I'm not sure if I like this mall or hate this mall.  

What I like about this place the most: it's right above the subway, so easy access in the winter, the Urban Eatery has a huge selection of fast food which was unique a few years back, but now it's becoming common place.  The selection of shops is great. 

What I hate about this mall: It's too busy, and parking is impossible to find.  

Verdict: Come here during non-peak times (i.e. not Black Friday, not X'mas) and its convenient if you work in the downtown core.  If you live in the 'burbs, there's no point coming here, just go to Yorkdale, Square One or Vaughan Mils where parking is much easier to find.",2

We ordered a family special for 4 of us which includes a bunch of meat, a side of kimchee or salad.  We added a couple bucks to get the ""prime meat"" but unfortunately I didn't pay that much attention to the meat.  It always seems good when meat is cooked on a table grill.

Excellent side dishes:
- Chicken Katsu curry rice - haven't found much japanese curry rice in town and this was excellent
- ramen - we ordered both types miso and *i forget*  both were excellent as well, and came with bowls ot share
- kimchee fried rice - delicious and also came with bowls.

Mochi ice cream to share for dessert - standard and good.

8719,1,1550880000000,"My favorite outdoor store!  I was traveling on vacation to Alaska and had nothing water repellant!  I really lucked out during special bonus back sale.  I picked up an awesome 3 way jacket... part 1 rain jacket with hood, part 2 inner liner as puffer jacket, and all 3 parts together awesome warm coat!  It kept me super warm and comfortable.  The ability to peel off layers was invaluable!  My favorite purchase thus far.  I also picked up a couple pairs capri pants, moisture repellant as well.

My husband picked up a new lightweight rain jacket and outdoor shoes.  Since the trip, he purchased 2 long sleeve water resistant shirts and the packing tubes water resistant as he was camping this month during monsoon season.  He's 6'5 250 lbs and was happy with the xxl shirts & jackets.  He did not pick up any shorts or pants.  Oh yeah, he did pick up some gadgets.

I've been back a couple times and picked up sun dresses.  They don't come in petite, so I did have to hem but was easy to do at home.  I also have a few UPF moisture wicking dresses which are saving me from overheating this summer!  I do have to try on every style of clothing to check the fit, each style fits differently.

As with any outlet store, I think it's important to know the price of items regularly to determine if you think you're getting a good deal.  I like to check online prices before I go anywhere and often have my phone out price checking. I always watch my purchases being rang up no matter where I shop to ensure the price is accurate. 

They also have awesome covered parking.",2

The space is very cool-the type that makes you feel like you are a million miles away. They achieve that costal Atlantic feeling well. And major bonus points for having the EPL on most of the TVs :) we sat at the bar and had wonderful, friendly service by the bartender. 

The brunch special was biscuits and gravy. I'm a total sucker for this dish and was a little worried when the bartender mentioned Italian sausage. The dish was not the typical southern sausage gravy but was excellent nonetheless. The biscuits were a bit denser than I normally prefer but still very good. It comes with eggs but I was allowed to substitute the white cheddar grits for no charge. My friend swapped the eggs for toast. It also comes with a huge ""side"" salad. The greens were very fresh and came dressed in a nice light vinaigrette which had a pleasant uniqueness to it. 

The other dish ordered by our party was the shrimp cake benedict which also came with the same side salad. My friend thoroughly enjoyed it. Portions all around were large and could easily be split. 

They have a short list of breakfast cocktails, all of which sounded delicious. I opted for the Salty Dog which was tempting given the fresh grapefruit juice promise. It did not disappoint. 

Hooray hooray for brunch where all the paths meet!",3

The manager we dealt with along with the training manager are no longer there.  New people are in and their customer service is a lot to be desired.  Told them I needed to put my membership and training on hold. I was told it would be a $25 fee per month on training and $5 per month on membership if I didn't bring in a note.  This is not what I was told when I first joined up. I have cancelled and will go elsewhere.

They do not enforce the use of towels so when you go onto a machine, you better wipe down the machine yourself otherwise your picking up someone else's sweat.  People who are on regular memberships take advantage of the memberships that are opened to those who have higher memberships so what's the point of paying more? Nothing is enforced.",2

Location is prime for this place! In the heart of old port-I quickly fell in love with the decor - it was refreshing, white accent lit by candle light, baby's breath flowers, had this cool eclectic Swing chairs. 

Food was pleasantly priced in the evening menu: snacks starting at 4-9$, main course-up to 18$ on average. (Note my ratings on a scale of 5 *s)

For 2- we ordered pear-parsnip toast (****), carpaccio funghi (****), kale Mac-n-cheese (***), onion rings(**), the big LOV burger (****) & the Buddha burger (***) with a side of white wine by the glass (Vin du QC- fruity notes-pleasantly enjoyable).

They grill every meat dish for you.  You don't have to do anything but pick which piece you want to eat.

It was a waste of money! My cake tasted very old, stale and dry as if it was sitting out for a week. I ordered pink champagne cake told them make it very very sweet lotts of sugar instead they did the opposite and made  it taste like a sugar free cake there was no flavor to it I was outraged I asked for strawberry filling and they put bananna or some other disgusting filling! The cake was about 6 inches tall/thick I was told they was going to put multiple layers of filling instead they put one thin layer of filling of a flavor I didn't request. It also looked like a white cake!  Why would they make a beautiful design on a horrible tasting cake If you are going to make a cake it needs to take good and fresh as it looks dont be cheap and not add ingredients just to save you some money.

We always go here whenever someone has a birthday, half birthday, or Wednesdays (just kidding, i wish).

We've tried their lemon, red velvet, and carrot cake. We're definitely ready to venture out onto their other flavors though. Not because we're tired of the other flavors, but if they're anything like the three I listed, then we're in for a world of trouble and weight-gain. Lord help us. 

The cream cheese frosting is dense and not too sweet (which is what I love most about it, because some cream cheese frostings can get TOO sweet) This frosting really compliments and balances out the sweetness of the cake itself. 

The cake is ALWAYS moist and I LOVE that you can choose to ""decorate"" the little packaging with flowers, ribbon, and a personalized notecard that they print out at the store.

I went to another shop previously who had told me my car was running perfectly fine and that the noise was normal so after looking around, I decided on USA auto repair when I seen their reviews on yelp.
Josh was very helpful and knew his stuff. It ended up being an exhaust leak as i suspected and josh and his team were able to confirm my suspicions and fix the issue. Their prices were very reasonable and they definitely prioritize you as a customer.

I had the miso soup ramen and the pork tonkatsu.  miso soup ramen was just the right amount of salty you'd expecct from miso soup.  I thought the corn was out of place in  such a yummy dish.  I ordered some Hamachi sushi and it was a nice belly piece and tasted fresh from the ocean.  I also had some tempura fried California rolls and that was the right mix of crunch.  These guys do it right.  I'd go again.  Maybe next time I will sit at the sushi bar.  Oh, the pork tonkatsu bowl was standard fare.

You need to try it! Our food was on point from the delicious iced tea, food, and service! Gil is the owner and very hospitable, treats his customers with respect and he's such a humble man. 
Anyway, my toddler had a large pancake with smiley face (because breakfast is served all day), my teen had red chili shredded beef enchiladas, rice and beans- she loved it! I had the special of the day: choice of meat so I had shredded beef burrito with red chili sauce all over it with tomatoes and lettuce topping. I thoroughly enjoyed it and took the leftover home. We ended our late lunch with sopapillas with some honey drizzled on it.

First impression: the place was a ghost town. Totally empty. Not a good sign.

The ""salad bar"" was, no joke, 2' x 3'. If you're making a movie and you need a miniature version of a real salad bar, come here. I told my wife I thought I was being punk'd. 

The ""lunch special"" was a BBQ sandwich for $10. It was God horrible. Couldn't eat it. The meat was very dry and rubbery and black on the outside. The BBQ sauce helped lube it up but didn't change the fact that it was inedible.

I returned that for the Prime Rib Sandwich for $16. MUCH better. The meat was perfectly cooked, tender and tasty. The au jus was also excellent. But - $16? For a sandwich? Off a lunch menu? 

So, three sandwiches, a salad (which my wife enjoyed), and some iced teas - including tip = $72! 

Yep. Punk'd.",2

Valet was also a ridiculous mess. Upon filing a complaint/report, I got nothing but ""filed paper!"" For future trips, I'd rather stay at a motel off the strip than at Flamingo!

Service was a tad bit slow, but it's a big restaurant so I understand. It's also a little more expensive than I think it should be. The upside to that is that the portions are big and you'll definitely be full when you walk out. 

They start you out with chips and salsa, which are pretty good. If you order the guacamole then someone will come to your table and make it right in front of you. It isn't really a new idea, but I think it's a good one. I got the chicken chimichanga. It was amazing! My only complaint is that it wasn't larger. They give you a large portion in sides...stuff like lettuce, salsa, guac, rice, beans. I would recommend it for anyone looking for good Mexican food in Pittsburgh.",2

My daughter went back in to have the bacon added and pay for it if necessary. Here's where it goes south.... instead of hearing the bacon and adding it to the sandwiches the decision was made to add it to the croissants and re heat them causing the croissants to get very dark and crispy on the outside. Now what sense did that make? And why would you ever do that to those delicious croissants. Ugh... so rather than going back in we've decided to never return.

The young girl who helped us was supportive of our price point and did her best to keep us within our limit. The management also gave us extra discounts as a result of an hourly raffle I won while shopping. Although I know the purchasing process can be lengthy I would have liked it to be a bit quicker the sale paperwork took about 2 hours and I was exhausted by the time we signed the final copy. And I had to wait three weeks for my furniture to be available for delivery. 

My furniture was delivered on time and as expected, the delivery men were professional and quick. Upon delivery the bedroom set was free of any scratches or imperfections that I worry about with delivery items. The men were kind enough to arrange the room to my specifications.

8933,3,1549670400000,"This review is long overdue, just never thought I had the need to do it since my sister had already written a review in 2010 (keep scrolling down, you'll see her review - she's the one from Cali).

I have tried my fair share of GTA patisseries that offer macarons in their menu, from this year's macaron day to my own macaron tours (versions 2010 and 2012). Ruelo is BY FAR still the best in the city.  Unless I haven't tried the macarons at a certain place, I have decided to just stick to Ruelo for macarons (with the exception of a lady that sells macs at the Aurora summer market - her pistachio flavour is very good!).

-1 star
 A) They don't have all the macaron and cake flavours available.  They rotate except for the regular flavours. 
B) Their macs and cakes are pricey. Macarons vary from $2.50 to $5.00 a piece. Single/mini cakes are over $5 a piece.

They use good quality ingredients, their cakes are very pretty and the macaron shells are the right texture. My fave mac flavours are creme brulee and salted caramel. Their Ruelo flavour, both macaron and cake will satisfy any chocolate lover.

Ruelo gets a solid 4 stars.
Parking at Time Square can be a hassle and the shop can get real tight when it's busy.  Glad they opened their shop at Yonge n Eg, it's bigger and somewhat closer since I moved downtown.",1

Today I went back who knows why,  and they asked me if I wanted to pay an extra $3 it would include tire cleaning,  I specifically asked,  will they clean the rims?

8938,2,1549756800000,"My wife and I don't often eat at restaurants this pricey but maybe once or twice a year, so when we do we really want to be sure that it's worth it. Some friends of our invited us out and really wanted to go here, the reviews made it sound wonderful so we agreed. The reviews, glowing as they are, don't do it justice in my opinion. Everything from the service to the food to the atmosphere is top notch. 

We sat in the treehouse. We'd seen this structure before when we'd walked through Crystals (the mall the restaurant is located in) and had no idea what it was, so we were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find out that the main dining room is located in this unique architectural feature. From below, you would think it's not that spacious, but feels very airy due to the open nature of the design. We didn't feel cramped in any way, and we had a party of 6. 

The waite staff are dressed in white jackets and bowties and they are the best at what they do. You feel very well taken care of without feeling watched or ""hovered"" over. 

The food is amazing. I won't mince words here, it's expensive and everything is 'a la carte', but the portions are substantial and the sides are easily shareable. In fact, that's the only potential ""negative"" of our experience. We ordered WAY TOO MUCH food, but that's not our server's fault. He warned us but we refused to believe him. The good news is we got to try a little bit of everything, the bad news is we ate a little too much of everything and still had food left over! 

I had the Chilean Sea Bass cooked ""oreganata"" style, which was amazing. They really know how to prepare seafood here. It's easy to overcook fish but this was cooked perfectly. Sea Bass is one of my favorite fish and this is easily one of the best I've ever had.  My wife decided to REALLY splurge and ordered one of the specials that was on offer, an 8oz Japanese Wagyu Steak for $125. Words don't do it justice. It was delicious. It melted in your mouth and was just buttery, rich and savory. Not a trace of gristle, every bite was perfect. 

Our friends ordered the roasted chicken which was excellent, a bone in ribeye with truffle butter which was almost as amazing as the Wagyu Steak for half the price, and halibut, which was also excellent and perfectly cooked. We started with oysters (I'm not a oyster connoisseur so I can't provide any more detail than that) and for sides we had sauteed asparagus, creamed spinach, gorgonzola mac and cheese, salt and vinegar fries and lobster mashed potatoes (now you see why we ordered too much food). All of the aforementioned items were excellent but the standout was the lobster mashed potatoes. We're not talking about mashed potatoes with bits of lobster flavor, we're talking about mashed potatoes drenched in melted butter with massive chunks of lobster. Seriously, there was not a bit of lobster less than an inch thick in there. It was fantastic. 

For dessert we again ordered too much. We had the butter cake (and you should too) which was easily shareable by 4 or more people, but again since I didn't believe the waiter, we ordered two. We also had chocolate covered strawberries and Key Lime Pie, both of which were fantastic, but the butter cake is a standout! 

Drinks. The wine menu is extensive and the beer selection was pretty decent too for a ""fancy"" type of place (which in my experience usually seem to look down on beer). The signature cocktails/martinis were delicious and, again, nicely portioned for the price. $17 seems pricey for a martini until you realize they give you the shaker with practically another entire glass full in there for a top off. They also have a nice selection of ports, dessert wines, and cordials for after dinner. I don't usually splurge on an ""after dinner"" drink, but I was in full on splurge mode that night, so I did. The waiter recommended a white dessert wine as opposed to a port since it would pair better with the butter cake, and he was not wrong. I had no idea what was good so I went with his recommendation, which was a Royal Tokaji 5 Puttonyos Aszu wine for $25. It blew me away. It was thick, viscous and sweet but not overly sweet and the flavor was a delicate array of fruit (apricot, hints of citrus and honey) with a creamy, slightly smoky finish. I immediately looked it up online and ordered a bottle for home, which was $50, that's how much I loved it. 

I can't reiterate enough how special this experience was to us. Our total for 6 people was a little over $800, but that price seems perfectly justified based on our experience. We would return here without hesitation, although we would definitely listen to our waiter next time when he says we might be ordering too much food, and if we were to show more restraint on our next visit, I think we could get out the door for under $200 (for 2 people). Which as a meal for a special occasion would be more than worth the price.",2
8939,1,1550793600000,"Calamari diavolo is what my dreams are made of. We also got the tortellini and veal Marsala. The tortellini was absolutely wonderful! Large pieces of shrimp, generous amounts of crab- 5 stars.  The Marsala was a little lack luster - good but it seemed like the whole thing was covered in gravy, rather than a Marsala sauce. Cannoli for desert- the filling was runny, and was actually dripping out of the cannoli shell. I wasn't too impressed by that. Service was also pretty slow, which was fine since we had no where else to be. BYOB was great. $7 corkage fee for wine.  Overall- pretty good!

8951,2,1549238400000,"I was back in my hometown, Sun Prairie, for the Sweet Corn Festival. Good, small-town American fun. Our plan was to visit the Festival on Saturday. So, Friday Night, my Dad wanted to treat us to an All-You-Can-Eat Fish Fry. I asked him about Erin's Snug Irish Pub and if he had been there before. He hadn't, and in fact he had been wanting to try it out. What a perfect time to do this!

Erin's isn't located in a residential area. It's in-between the build up of Madison & Sun Prairie. Right by American Family Insurance. Growing up, this was all farm fields. Now, you can't tell when Madison ends and Sun Prairie begins!  The outside of Erin's is fresh and crisp. Nice landscaping. Inside was a bit of a surprise for me. It's really nice. Woodsy décor. Beautiful rugs on the floor. Lot of little nooks and crannies to sit in besides the larger dining areas they have. Plus, a long bar with plenty of seating. 

The bar was busy, but the restaurant not so much. We got a table right away. It was a little too close to the bar, as for the noise level was high. Looking into the menu, I saw why the bar was so busy. Erin's has a Happy Hour that runs until 6 o'clock. We arrived just after 5:30, so when our server stopped by, we inquired about it. A buck off draft beers. 2 bucks off apps. Erin's has a good selection of beers and it wasn't hard for me to pick one out. A Wisconsin brown ale. Alyssa went with a Raspberry Tart from New Glarus. My Dad got a Long Island Iced Tea. My Ma, well, I can't remember. 

The menu is pretty well laid out. Lots of selections highlighting Irish Fare. The back page has all the daily specials. Friday tells me that the AYCE Fish Fry is served standard with Beer Battered Cod, Steak Fries, and Coleslaw for $13.99. That is exactly what my Dad & I got. Alyssa got a Rubin and my Ma got a Salmon Burger with Sweet Potato Fries.

After ordering, our server brought us a bread basket. Fresh, hot, garlicky buns with soft butter. Boy. Those were good. We devoured them. Our wait for supper wasn't all too long. My supper came with two full fillets of lightly battered Cod, a large pile of Steak Fries, a medium sized ramekin of colorful Coleslaw, and a small ramekin of Tartar & a lemon wedge. 

I squeezed the lemon on my fillets and took a dip into the tartar sauce.  Solid taste. Batter isn't thick. Too much lemon might make your Cod a bit soggy. The tartar was really good. Seemed to be house made. It was chunky with dill pickle. The Steak Fries aren't a favorite of mine. I personally don't think they go well with a Fish Fry. They are called Steak Fries for a reason. right? To go with Steak? I think a Fish Fry should get the skinny Fries. The Coleslaw was fantastic. Again, seemed to be house made. Purples & oranges mixed in. Great cutter into all the fried food bites.

Our server was alright in checking back in with us. I was able to get a few more pieces. I shared with Pheona and gave a bite to Alyssa. Her Rubin was good. I got a bite of it. The bread didn't get soggy, as some Rubin's do. 

The cost isn't justified of this Fish Fry. $13.99 is way to high. Reason being: You don't get any selection. No choice of side or Cod. A Baked Cod would be nice. I'm happy we tried this place out, and will be back to have a drink. But $13.99? C'mon Erin's. For that cost, let me choose what kind of potato I get with it. Overall, the food was good. But not $13.99 good. The ambiance is nice, but loud. This is a place worth checking out. There's a little something for everyone.",2

8965,1,1549324800000,"Stripsteak sucked. My steak was overcooked, the trio of pureed potatoes or whatever they call it was a joke, and the trio of ""duck fat"" fries must have been fried in 5% duck fat or something, because they tasted like something Burger King would serve (except for the white truffle ones, but how can you screw that up, really?).

The three pureed potatoes dishes were lobster, which, while I love big chunks of lobster, tasted like an experiment on how to get starchy potatoes and a bag of white flour into a pasty goo reminiscent of gruel which clung so steadfastly to the lobster chunks that it didn't offer the opportunity to salvage them from the muck, the sour cream and chive version, almost as gooey and I guess was worth one taste, and the third, horseradish, I guess was supposed to be some kind of traditional take on wasabi mashed potatoes you would have seen on every menu five years ago.

Service wasn't anything to brag about either. This is another one of those places where they really need to train their waitstaff a little better. For this kind of money and they large crowd it draws, they should be watching for your fork and knife to come together on the plate in the interest of turning the table over. We waited a long time for our check, and I think they only took notice when I got up to use the restroom.",2

I got a chopped brisket sandwich and a cup of potato salad. Friend ordered pulled pork and grilled broccoli which I coveted, even though there was nothing wrong with the obviously homemade potato salad, I'm going for the veggies next time. I had no regrets about the brisket which was smokey and tender. A variety of sauces stood at a continent track which I sampled sparingly to avoid covering the smokey goodness of the brisket. 

We were having family over that evening and had planned for pizza. Making a command decision, I  bought a pound of pork and a half pound of brisket. At home I laid the meat out on a plate to warm in the microwave. The brisket had a nice red smoke ring, with tarty scorched ends. The pork was tender, pleasantly stringy, and succulent, even after being refrigerated and microwaved

8991,2,1551225600000,"I've been bringing my daughter here for the past few months. In general, I think the office is well run. I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes and that's mostly for well child visit. I see a lot of reviews saying long wait in the waiting room, but we haven't experienced that yet thankfully. Where they do have long waits is on the phone! Every time I call, I usually get asked to be placed on hold and they take 10 minutes on average to get back. I find that mildly annoying, but in general something I can deal with. 
Another thing I noticed, is that they tend to err on the cautious side with anything that a pediatrician cannot handle, and refer you out to specialist right away. I understand that some of it just has to do with how medical offices work today, so in this case parent has to apply some common sense and make a call. I think some of our referrals have been pre-mature and given that the baby grows so quickly, she outgrew the ""problems"" within a week. I guess I would also appreciate if the Doc could say something like ""I think she'll need to see a specialist if this doesn't go away for X number of weeks"" rather than ""I'd like her to see a specialist for this issue"". It's probably a good thing to be aware and like I said, as a parent sometimes you need to make a call what makes sense for your child.
I really like that they have sick and well child entrances. This is especially helpful during the flu season and helps keep the infection at bay. I've only seen Dr. Ramirez and Dr. Nania in the office and they are both great. Really good with kids. They were able to handle the sleep deprived first time mom really well and give some comforting advice when we came in to see them for newborn well visits.",3

The burger came with a pretzel bun, bourbon mustard, gruyere, and pickles. Word to the wise: I ordered it medium rare and it was pretty close to rare, so order a bit warmer than you normally would. The burger was a little messy, and I've learned I don't like pretzel buns, but a solid burger. Friends got the shaved wagyu sandwich (with gruyere, jus, and horseradish cream) and couldn't say enough good things. If you want to sit outside, you'll only have access to a limited menu, but the inside is beautiful and inviting. I grabbed a five-beer flight, and for $15, I was blown away. The samples were probably 6 oz, and I couldn't finish all five. Definitely a great bang for your buck if you want to try multiple beers. Overall awesome experience!",3

8998,3,1549584000000,If it's a warm day you can find me sitting on the deck at Grandview Saloon enjoying a drink and the amazing view! I absolutely love sitting on the deck here! I have been numerous times but it's strictly a place I come to get drinks. Beers are decently priced. I've had appetizers a few different times and they are always good just overpriced and nothing special. I've never been for dinner. The inside decor is a little outdated. If you sit on the deck the restroom is a bit annoying because you have to go up 2 flights of steps. I will say the service is always good. I just recently came with a party of 10 and they were very accommodating with our seating arrangement outside. It's right by the Duquesne incline so if you're on Mt Washington and want to sit back and take in the amazing view I defiantly recommend stopping in.,2

The customer service here was great and they didn't pester you when you were looking around.

Prices seem high but rolls are HUGE and the owner/server is very helpful and accurate as to what amounts you should order. We spend $20 each for dinner there and are stuffed. Lovely plating as well, not just hunks of fish on a plate thrown in front of you.

9097,1,1549238400000,"So I've only been paint-balling maybe a year now, but this is by far my favorite field to play at and from my own experiences and talking with friends it is probably the best field in Arizona.

Yes it can be a bit of a drive from different parts of North Phoenix(Scottsdale in my case), but it is well worth it. There are a total of 5 fields, though I have never played Field 4 due to my groups always being rather large.

Field 1 is a massive course with empty trailers and cars, downed helicopters, trenches, and buildings/rooms to go in and out of.
Field 2 and 3 are smaller versions of the above with Field 3 having a maze of rooms and trenches for close quarter combat.
Field 4 is a small speed ball type layout and Field 5 is mainly trenches with a  bunch of fortified bunkers.

The rentals are very good and Henry the owner is super helpful if you have any type of issues with your equipment. It caters to both experienced players and complete rookies like myself. Last time I played the entry fee was around $20 and for another $10 you got full rentals, gear, and air. The paint they sell is reasonably priced compared to other local fields and they also allow you to bring your own paint as long as they approve it. From what other players have told me, their rental guns are really solid compared to most other fields.

They stress safety big time and don't mess around, so if you are an idiot or cowboy who is trying to hurt people you aren't going to be allowed onto the fields. The refs seem to always be on the ball and helpful in explaining rules., performing paint checks, even helping fix your fancy new paintball gun when it suddenly stops working. They seem super kid friendly as I often see birthday parties being thrown  for kids as young as 6-10.

If you are going to paintball in Phoenix, it is pretty hard to come up with a reason to play anywhere else other than Fightertown Paintball...short of the fact it is all outdoors compared to an indoor field.

The only negative I can think of really isn't that big of a deal. Like most fields the more experienced players tend to flock to the same side so you often will find one side full of mainly rookie players with rentals and the other side full of experienced players. The refs occasionally try and split up the newbie players(typically guys with rentals) 50/50 so the teams are evenly matched, but making a more concerted effort might improve game play a bit more for the rookies. 

Overall this is a minor issue...and is dependent on who happens to be playing on a given day.

My favorite field is easily FIELD 1 given its size and your ability to move around - plus there are multiple flags throughout the field so you can play different scenarios - capture the flag, elimination, hostage rescue and extraction, VIP escort etc.

FIELD 3 and 2 are fun and I'd love it if they played more often on FIELD 2 which is a blast. Field 5 is probably my least favorite field but that is just because I get my ass handed to me every time I play it.

I have yet to play on FIELD 4 but that is because you need a small group for that field given the speed ball layout and size.

One other suggestion: it would be cool if the refs would vary things up occasionally with more scenario type games in between the elimination games: say like capture the flag, doing a SEAL vs. Terrorist hostage extraction game, having a game with medics who can bring players back to life, and also maybe having some props like duffel bags for a bank robbery vs. cops ""HEAT"" type scenario. Making certain players head shot only because they are wearing ""imaginary"" body armor, etc etc.

Overall this paintball park kicks ass. If you like paintball then you will like playing it.",2

9103,2,1550620800000,"The Plaza Hotel and Casino was our first downtown Freemont experience, It was at the beginning or end depending which way you would like at it.  Right when walk out of the hotel you were heading into downtown the weird and the fun of down town Las Vegas.  The hotel was decent, you can tell they have gone through some type of remodel in their rooms and that helped with the fact the walkways to the parking structures and hallways smelled like smoke. The front desk staff & maids are lazy, they did not clean the rooms, make our beds, and we had to ask three plus times to get clean towels up to the room.  Over all I would stay there again because the hotel was not as busy as the hotel on the strip and fairly priced. I would command trying this hotel vs. any other in downtown Vegas.  For those that want more detail read pros and cons below. 


Pros:
Decent room for the price
remodeled room
Casino was clean
Bathroom was well taken care off every time and every visit
View of downtown and the great light experience
Good choice of slots for its size
 Not filled with drunk groups
Drink servers were attentive & helpful
Parking is free for guest only
Easy and accessible to downtown Las Vegas
Valet Parking attendants ( Notice it but did not use their service)
They kept the homeless and the drunk out of the hotel
Good security presence
Music was appropriate for all ages
No kids roaming around like Circle Circle

Cons:
Bathroom was very small, caution to the big and beautiful
No coffee in rooms
Their hotel maids and front desk are lazy. 
Parking structures is often full during peak times. If you are a guest I recommend finding a good parking spot and staying there while you walk and take in what the hotel as to offer. 
Pool was a decent size but nothing special about it
Food court had very limited choices.
Hallway and walkways smells like old smoke",3

Didn't regret that move as soon as we took a bite into it. Unlike most almond croissants, this one was in long form. Rolled up pastry dough along with almond meal. Wasn't too sweet but just the right amount of sweetness and topped with sliced roasted almonds. Ooh la la...I had to keep myself from ordering another one! Into our salad and panini. The Healthy Salad was a big bowl of micro greens and local greens with quinoa with chicken. The taste and texture crunchy and chewy was awesome! Chicken was grilled perfectly and the quinoa that was stuck into the chicken along with the tahini pomegranate dressing was just paired so well!

Kitchenette with a stove (need to call room service to deliver kitchen utensils and pots/pans) and an ultra luxurious robe and slippers to use doing your stay.

This place used to be all the rage back in the day and I always kind of thought it was overrated. Having gone again recently for a co-worker's birthday, I'd say it was a little better than I remember, but nothing crazy.

Server said the best thing on their lunch menu was the Reuben Wishes He Was This Cool. He said it was hands down the best. It wasn't though unfortunately. He even convinced the people in the group who don't even like Reubens to try it and all 4 of us were disappointed. The bread seemed stale and the meat was nothing crazy, just average at best.

A couple co-workers got the Corn Nuts About Scallops which was pretty awesome. I wish I had gotten that.

Bread Pudding was good. Definitely get it for dessert.

9167,1,1550534400000,"I've been in my first home two years now and the place was built in '84. I had no doubt my ducts were dirty, but didn't expect anything like what I saw come outta them after using Brian's service.

I was slightly hesitant at first to get my ducts cleaned because I've heard both positive and mixed opinions about it. I decided to go for it regardless. After calling around town and getting some of the most ridiculous over the top prices, I decided on All Ducts Cleaning. Brian is a pretty down to earth, easygoing, easy to talk to, knowledgeable, hard-working guy. I felt confident he knew what he was doing and trusted him moving around inside my home.

He showed me the brand new filter in his machine before starting the process and what it looked like afterwards. Afterward, it was caked thick with dust, dirt, and sentiment between 8 ducts in which Brian climbs up, removes all the air vents, and uses a special rotating tool with brushes going back and forth to break up whatever is inside. From there, everything gets sucked-in one main duct via a high-powered HEPA filtered machine.

He also checks and goes into explaining the different types of air filters to use. Cleans out the area where the air filter goes and finishes off using some type of air ""conditioning"" spray which you can really feel the difference in air quality as it disinfects throughout the home moving through the system.

It's been two weeks so far and I definitely don't sneeze as much as I used to everyday. Will be looking forward to getting the ducts cleaned again in a few years.",2

I definitely like that they seem to make regular updates and additions to the mall, which there's always something changing here. For instance, I hadn't come here in three weeks and within that period, the smoothie place was gone and replaced with an eyeglass kiosk. That was sad, though, as it was the only place that offered bubble tea in the south hills that I know of. Hopefully they're bringing that back!

The food options are okay. They're pretty decent and somewhat varied as far as mall food goes. They recently renovated the food court and it's now much easier to walk through and it also appears much brighter. I think the last time I was here, all their food court vacancies have been filled. 

I like that they put in a Target that connects to the mall. However, a complaint is how Barnes and Noble does not connect. If you're a newbie to the mall, you probably wouldn't know that. 

Overall, decent mall. The area also has a decent selection of retail stores to make South Hills Village a one stop area for all your shopping needs. It also looks like it's been growing over the years and continues to grow.",2

My nails never lift, I never develop any fungus, and they always look great.  But...I also am very committed to going every two weeks for a fill because that is the proper length of time to get a fill and every 2-4 weeks for a pedicure because that is what keeps my feet in top condition.  I have seen people in the salon complain because their nails are lifting and then they say they've not had a fill in over 4 weeks.  You must maintain yourself properly - you can't drive a car without keeping it full of oil and then wonder why your car doesn't work.  I have seen some of the negative reviews posted and in all the years I have been going there, I have never seen anything like that happen.  I have never seen anything unsanitary and I have never seen employees acting inappropriately.  I highly recommend Nails 20/20 for people who appreciate quality!",2
9212,3,1549670400000,Yes!!!! I lucked out and found another awesome diner!! Again I love places like this it seems to have an at home  nostalgic feeling. I ordered a vegetable plate and was very satisfied . The prices are very reasonable. The staff is very welcoming and friendly I will definitely be back!!!,3
9213,1,1549756800000,"This was a spur of the moment visit. My friends were already feeling happy after a tour of the Ontario Sake Company and wanted to continue the party and what better way to do that than visit a Japanese pub. So after meddling with two choices of Izakayas we settled on this spot. The place was packed (it was Saturday night so expected). We were put on a communal table with a limited time frame as there was big group coming over with reservations. 
I have been to their Vancouver location and other tried a couple of dishes there so was expecting a similar setup. However this place is more like Guu and is quite loud. 
Never mind as I do enjoy a good energy level. 
We started out with Nama Nama (un-pasteurized version) and then ordered a combo of items to share. Meanwhile as we waited we munched on some edamame and discussed the benefits of Sake (from what my friends were told :) 
On to main
Tako Wasabi. Very good. 
Ebi Mayo: Good. Nicely fried with thin batter. The mayo was seasoned well. A benchmark dish for Izakayas done well. 
Red Tuna & Black Tiger Prawn Avocado Tartar: Poor. The taste of tuna was completely lost here. No seasoning at all and shrimp were wasted as well the avocado overpowered everything else here. The toasts that are provided were not enough and we had to wait quite a bit for an extra helping to mop it up. 
Spicy Chopped Tuna Battera and Salmon Oyako Battera: Average iteration of sushi here. Presentation is nice but a very mundane take on sushi.
I might drop by again to try other dishes as I think our experience would have been better if we had ordered some other dishes.
For now 3.5 stars.",2

9234,1,1550016000000,"I was VERY nervous about getting a rental with this company as a) My dad has never heard of them and b)I read all the reviews online about them and most of them were negative

In any event, via Priceline, I scored a rental for $9/day. Dude. Can't beat that! My pick up time was 8AM on a Thursday, but I arrived an hour earlier. I explained that to the agent (after waiting 10 minutes for the people ahead of me to check in) but she was nice and stated that if the car is ready it's no problem. She asked me how many passengers I had (just one) and how much luggage we had (not much) so she stated she'd upgrade me to a convertible at no cost if I didn't mind. HELL I didn't mind! I'm in Vegas AND I get a convertible instead of a Kia?!? WOOHOO! Got my keys and headed down to the car... REDDISH/MAROON Mitsubishi convertible. YAYER!!! Car drove nicely with no issues.

On a side note... she did mention to me that there was a scratch on the vehicle on the front driver's side and that it was marked on the inspection sheet. When I got to the car I didn't see a scratch so I did a quick check for dents and didn't see much in the dark parking garage. Got back to my hotel... and saw a big scratch on the REAR driver's side! I'm assuming they marked ""front"" but it was ""back"" so I freaked out and went to my room to call the rental agency and explain the discrepancy. I was probably on the phone for 45 minutes (after calling several numbers and being transferred several times, very frustrating) BUT God Bless the last female agent that helped me because she transferred me to the manager at the McCarren office... I explained everything to him and he was VERY friendly, VERY understanding, and VERY patient. I told him that it should be in the computer records that the scratch is in fact on the back NOT the front and that whomever inspected the vehicle just marked it incorrectly. He agreed but stated it would take some research to find that information... so he said that he would look to aid in my comfort even though he said everything would be fine... and if he calls me back there's an issue but if I don't hear from him there are no issues...

He never called back and when I returned the car everything was fine. He really gave me peace of mind and told me not to worry and to enjoy my vacation. Jeremy was his name! Exceptional experience (besides all the calls before reaching Jeremy) and I'd book with them again!",2

The staff again were so friendly and attentive without being too much in your face.. our waiter ensured we were taken care of completely, and the foodddddd! Gimme a minute.. sigh 

I decided to go for the salmon with a white wine and cream sauce, with garlic mash, and a mocktail strawberry daiquiri!
The salmon fell apart it was Devine! The garlic mash quite literally, melted in my mouth I don't know if I've ever experienced mash so nice and I'm a heavy potato critic! Trust me!
Now the daiquiri holy good god!! For a cocktail that had no alcohol in it, it was the nicest I have ever ever had. Even my fiancé was disgusted he tried it, as he didn't want his beer anymore then! Imagine how nice it would be with alcohol too. Yum! My fiancé also ordered an old fashioned with a strip of bacon in it, which I found odd but he thoroughly enjoyed it ha!

I had some leftovers and thought it would be bad, but I ate it for lunch the following day and still great!

I called about paying for and  picking up a tow today and they refuse to let us pay for it and let the car go. Keeping the car for another day and incurring more fees.  Told me he didn't have time to deal with this he has other things to do. If they are short staff then that is not my  problem.

The cashiers here late night are very very very slow.. and usually its the only lane open since self checkouts close early... (why?!) 

Pharmacy is even slower. I'm talking like an hour for a prescription. I go to another pharmacy on jane & 23rd which is 100x better & faster.

Produce selection is nice. its always worth checking out the sale ad that week. You can find good deals on coffee, cereal and produce.

To get to the elevators you have to show your room key to the bellman to validate. The only down fall the room was full of dust like no housekeeping entered for months, the silverware and glasses dirty had to wash everything again. Even though I brought to someone's attention nothing was done. I left something in the room and I've been told that I should check with security if it was found they will have it. Long story short I told the front desk to page the housekeeping and find out who clean the room so that's much easier to find out about the piece left behind.

I did find the pricing to be a bit high, however not having tasted the food, as yet, I will reserve my comment.

There is nothing better than walking into an establishment where the staff is happy to be there and it shines through from the moment they greet and seat you, until you say goodbye.

Today, I ordered food to pick up and ordered the same pizza for a third time. I was told they didn't have Alfredo sauce for pizza only white garlic or red sauce (even after having it twice!)  I asked if they could put the Alfredo on the side like the did before, the woman taking my order said they could ( I don't understand why it can be put on the side and not the pizza.)

9323,1,1550880000000,"First time there was a good experience. We ordered:

FRESH BURRATA CHEESE with roasted grapes & toasted bread- Bread was crisp yet soft, drenched in olive oil (YUM) The roasted grapes were sweet and worked so well with the burrata cheese. It was a heavenly combo, really enjoyed this way more than I thought I would. I would get this again for sure!

ROASTED BONE MARROW- bone marrow is usually always good, this one was lovely because it had the oxtail marmalade which gave it a lot of flavour. Our size of bone marrow was perfect for two people. The crostini's were a little harder than I wanted it to be but other than that no real complaints.  

SPAGHETTI ALL'AMATRICIANA- this was the dish I was waiting to try all night, the pasta was cooked perfectly, the portion was just right (since we shared everything). It has a kick of spice that lingers but too much and doesn't over power the dish at all. It had bits of something in the suace, I couldn't really identify. It was just a lot of flavour in the dish and the cheese on top of it was delicious! Worth getting again.

ROASTED B.C. HALIBUT- this was my least favourite dish, the halibut wasn't really moist so it wasn't cooked to perfection. TBH it was a little dry. It was lacking in sauce, but the sauce that was at the bottom of the plate had a strong yet tasty seafood flavour. I assume that was from the pieces of squid in the dish. If we weren't so full we probably would've asked for more sauce to drench the fish in. Didn't finish this nor would we get it again.

Service was good, atmosphere on patio was nice on a summer night and the place was packed, recommend you make reservations! Will definitely be going back.",2

Reason why I didn't get excited at first is because most places that serve boba in this town serve average quality drinks (artificial tasting, powdery, hard boba).  Even Spring Mountain isn't worth driving to anymore.  After my first visit to this place, I have been only coming to them when I'm craving milk tea or a slush with boba.  They aren't pretentious, and the service is amazing like so many reviewers have already said.  The owner is always there helping and making adjustments if needed to create the perfect drink.  The tea bar is small and clean.  They serve quality boba, and they're close to home.  Even if they weren't, I would make the commute to go.

We have heard lots of good things about this place and I am pleased to say it is as good as people say. We were seated on the patio (a good option for a rowdy 3 year old) and were promptly given water. I ordered the Tres Amigos margarita special of the night ($7) and liked it. Next time, I'll have to try the rasberry ($8) or pomegranate margarita ($9). Hubby got the mojito and it was decent. They were also doing free tequila tastings of Tres Amigos Blanco, Anejo and I can't remember the third. I really enjoyed that as anytime I am typically having tequila, I am not exactly concerned with the tastings differences in each blend. So, I learned something new this time. Very cool. The menu looks really great and I look forward to trying new dishes here. I had the salmon and spinach enchiladas that came with rice and vegetables. The rice was moist and delicious and reminded me a lot of the rice I grew up eating with Puerto-Rican dishes. The veggies were my favorites: red onions, and green and yellow squash. The enchiladas were pretty good but I would probably not order them again. I am more of a traditional enchilada type of girl and as much as I love salmon, I guess I don't prefer it in my enchiladas. But that is no fault to Padres as the dish was very good. My husband ordered their steak and unfortunately, his medium rare steak came out well done. They fixed it but hubby was very annoyed that I was pretty much finished with my plate when his remake came out. The server was great even though he forgot my daughter's drink and ordered her a cheese quesadilla appetizer and not the kids cheese quesadilla. But other than that, he consistently checked on us, was knowledgeable and enthusiastic on the menu and told us we should come back for salsa nights. On Friday and Sat nights, they do salsa dancing and bring in a band. I can't wait to go for that with some girlfriends. Fri it is 8:30-11:30pm and Sat it is 8-11pm.",3

Everything I ordered, they were out of. Mocha? Nope. Vanilla iced coffee? Nope.  

I really wanted a dessert crepe or sundae, but they were out of fruit. That killed everything that I was in the mood for. How about a scoop of ice cream? Could you do that? 

""Um,, yeah why wouldn't we have it?"" *me staring at the waiter dumbfounded*

The place was pretty dirty too, so I'm glad I didn't order anything. When I went to use the bathroom before leaving, it looks like it hadn't been cleaned in at least 3 months. There was also a strange woman in there and I'm almost pretty sure she was doing drugs but I didn't hang around long enough to find out. It's unfortunate that this place is so dumpy but I think it's mainly because of the area it's in.

I've gone through extensive surgery being hit by two drunk drivers at two separate accidents where I lost my right arm,  my back was completely broken and needed to be replaced with titanium in my right arm was reattached with no main nerve able to function any longer in it. Hannah was so understanding of medically what was done to try to save me and the amount of pain that I experienced on a daily basis.I had to give her a hug on my second visit to let her know that she actually gave me my life back. Where as, the other doctor that I was seeing in another Pain Management practice cut my medicine so low that I could not get out of bed to go grocery shopping to just stand up and do dishes or to walk my dog and the depression set in so badly that I realized I did not want to live if I had to live like this any longer. I'm a very active person who is not even having my pain covered. Rather than write me the correct script that I had weaned myself down to he suggested I think find a Nother doctor which was actually a blessing. I will never go anywhere else as the folks in this facility understand exactly what has gone on inside my body, how much titanium is there, my undying need to be normal and moving and exercising and running with my dogs and in control of my own life. All things of course must be reviewed and I think it's Hannah did an excellent job studying my surgery cases and all the titanium that was put into my back etc. Miss Hannah gave me my life back as I knew it! On my second visit I gave her a huge hug and thanked her for giving me my life back and for taking the depression away after seeing someone who obviously did not read any of the CAT scans or surgeries that I've been through.",2

Valet parking, coat check at the door, a staff that knows the menu and specials inside and out, and little details like table crumbing and helping refill our sangria made this experience exceed my expectations.

I used a living social deal to save a few bucks, the bill was still no joke but if you go wild over A+ service then it's worth it and then some.

If your looking for the best gyro in the greater Pittsburgh area this just might be it.  I don't live in Pittsburgh but I have been to 2 other local gyro spots (mike & Tonys, lesvos) and I have to say the Original Gyro edges both of them out.  

When it comes to gyros there are 2 main criteria: taste of the meat and the tzatziki sauce.  Their lamb is cooked and spiced to perfection on a spitter and the amount of meat they give you is overwhelming, I honestly had to take some out so I could fit it in my mouth.  The flavor of the lamb was sealed in my fingernails for a good 3 hours even after I washed my hands, a true sign of slowly seasoned meat.  Their tzatziki sauce is nice and not too overpowering, like a cucumber cool whip, definitely no feta which I do not care for in my gyros.

I had to take off some point off for the cash only policy even though their prices are pretty reasonable ($5.50 for gyro only, $6.29 gyro, fries, drink).  Also the lack of menu items is a lil disappointing, would love to see some spit roasted pork or chicken souvlaki like they have in Greece or some homemade moussaka.  

But if your a Gyro Junky like myself you have to give this place a try.",2

Overall great place of you're not looking for any bells and whistles and just want to have decent   and well priced wontons. Compared to other wonton places at the same pricepoint though I wouldn't say this was my fave.

They also colored the spikes and screens the same color of my house and I can barley tell that there on my house. They also created a spa guard for a portion of my pool where the birds were drinking the water in my pool. They did all that a fair price.

She blatantly disrespected me in front of her entire salon of staff customers. I have been coming here since I was in junior high, so half of my entire life. I was always so happy here when it was managed by Johnny. Then suddenly they had new management. The salon is terrible now. We went as a group and they left 2 of us waiting while 2 employees just sat there but then later on were working on walk in customers before starting on us. Because of that I ran out of time to do my nails, but got my toes done and I was just gonna come back for the rest. They said it would be $5 extra for the polish I wanted and I agreed. At the checkout she charged me 45 instead of 35. I tried to dispute it but she insisted it was for another 10 for getting my nails painted. That should have been included in a pedicure. They never mentioned the $10 fee til after and it was not listed anywhere. I paid because I already had gotten the service but I felt wrong about it. Upon talking to my friends, no one else paid that much in our group. I called back on the phone and asked for exactly what I got with all the add-ons and she quoted me $35. I came down 2 speak with her and she went back 2 her old story with the hidden fee because she already had my money. She kept saying ""I don't know who you are if you are on the phone"". Yes but you know the prices of yiur services. So ur just charging me more cuz u think I have money? Why do u need to know who I am to give me a price? I will never give them a dollar again. The manager is rude, she doesn't know her own prices or is false advertising, has no concept of satisfying a dissatisfied customer, couldn't even handle having the conversation about the problem, kept trying to explain herself to her current manicure customer (hello, she is a customer and not involved in this in anyway, nor does she want to be, and how is that even gonna help you? I'm the one that wants to understand why you are ripping me off), and she is a greedy business owner not worthy of Johnny's repeat customers.

Comfortable surroundings with wifi and local patrons sitting typing away or meeting with friends or colleagues.

The food and beverages are solid with a number of options.  What makes this place difficult to rate is the service - I keep getting the sense that I am a burden when ordering.  No smiles, sometimes even a sigh... and the orders are straight from the posted menu without substitution or special request.  I even brought a friend in with me and she was taken by the attitude as well.

The chips are warm, fresh, and super super crisp.  I love them.  I didn't even need salsa for the chips.  They are AWESOME!  The best chips I have ever had.  Yes, EVER!  

I love the simple menu.  I opted out for the one of the specials, quesadilla with chicken street meat and cheese.  The tortilla was just very good not just like a regular flour store brought kind, this sucka was fresh.  The chicken street meat was the BOMB (slow roasted and braised with garlic clove, rosemary, and citrus juices).  OMG, PARTY in my mouth!

Regardless, and unbeknown to us, we took the truck home.   There were so many things not washed or cleaned... it was ridiculous.  The next day we took the truck for a redo... after 4 hours, still dirty.  Dirty windows, gum in the truck bed, same old coffee spill still in the cup holder.  10 hour and $200 later.  We paid for a detail and got a crappy wash.

Flash forward... 8 months later.  I thought, maybe, they could do a basic wash.  I was WRONG!   DO NOT TAKE YOUR CARE HERE.  After $17.00, they couldn't even clean the cupholders, a service that was specifically shown on the menu under the $17.99 wash package.  Ugg!",2
9684,1,1549497600000,It's brand new so aesthetically it's very nice. There were a few weird things about it that were slightly off-putting: primarily with the working staff. The rooms don't provide any hair conditioner and with very long hair the 2in1 stuff doesn't work very well. I just asked the front desk if they had any little bottles and you would have thought I asked her to chop her leg off. I also inquired about firm pillows as the ones in the room are so squishy your head goes totally flat. Same response. They have a little sundries shop in the lobby and I went to get a snack one evening (around 930) and the front desk girl was sitting on the lobby couch watching tv. I tried to get her attention for several minutes before she saw me. The air conditioner was very loud if you turned it below 74 degrees so it was pretty warm in the room unless you can sleep with a dinosaur in the room. Weak water pressure in the shower. Slightly nit-picky but I was more concerned with the staff than the room itself.,2

We were in room 1606 which has 2 queens and a magnificent front row view of the CN tower and lake. The bathroom is huge with a double sink, Tv in mirror, high quality toiletries and strong pressure shower. 6pm turndown service was fantastic. Totally enjoyed the indoor pool and ended all our days with a jacuzzi visit. There was endless supply of free bottled water and afternoon gumballs and sour gummies in the lobby. Fast wifi, walking distance to Union Station, CN tower; Starbucks, Tim Horton's and 24 hr A&W burger place. Highly recommended !",2

I've had better at Taco Bell and sadly, or maybe not, I've had better HERE at Cabo Fish Taco, so what is going on... It does not seem they are slipping it seems more like a Fall a dive in quality and flavor, not a swan dive, a NOSE Dive!

Fishy, Mahi Mahi should not NOT taste fishy especially when it has BBQ sauce to mask the flavor of the Fish, still fishy tasting!  The Menu said it was Mahi, so maybe it was a mistake, we made one too!  Glad to say neither of us became physically ill!

The Mashed Potatoes were so Cold as if they came out of the Refrigerator... Equally as disappointing as the worst parts of the meal!

What is cooler than cold, Tacos at Cabo Fish Taco!  Some food is like Revenge (better when served COLD)!  If they could make everything as good as their Corn Salsa I would be giving them closer to two or three yelp stars!

My Beer Battered Shrimp Taco (the Dish that used to be good here) was the best part of the meal and it was not very good!  The Wrap was COLD and the sauce had little flavor!

The other Dish I previously enjoyed here (years ago) was the Nopalito Salad I call it a Bean and Cactus Salsa! This time it was almost flavorless 

The service was friendly and laid back, maybe a little too laid back since our food came out room temperature and since there were only two other tables (of two people each and they were already eating) it would be different if they were busy!  Here is how they approach the question they should have asked ""How was your meal?""?  Instead they say : ""Everything's good isn't it""?  They noticed we did not eat very much!  They knew we did not enjoy it!

One improvement is the Boys Bathroom!  Congrats!  This is a good upgrade from years ago!  If the food could have stayed good. I'd settle for going outside like before, (I was not the only one)!  I know you can get in trouble for that, so I'm glad they made that improvement!

The meal was so disappointing we went out to eat AFTER leaving this place!  After an experience this poor I want something good to make sure I still have Taste buds!  I did!!!

We accidentally arrived this place and decided to give it a try. This is a small restaurant but is very clean. The staff here are very friendly. They have cool mung bean soup in this hot summer day for free and refill instead of ice water. They also brought in Sichuan pickles as our appetizer. The pickle was authentic, not like Cantonese styled. Their Manu is short but every single dishes are tasty just as it is supposed to be. We ordered spicy sour wonton, house special rib noodle and Chengdu minced meat noodle. All tasted fabulous!  We definitely will come back. It beats any buffet on the stop after several days away from home.",2

We moved here from Chicago and have had plenty of pizza in NYC over the years and I honestly don't understand the negative reviews about this place. Maybe the staff saw how the company was being looked at on here and made some changes, I say that because we were very impressed.

We ordered a large pizza with bacon and pep, along with a order of Garlic Knots and a 6 pack of Bud.

The guy on the phone was very polite and made sure he got our order correct, he said it would be 45mins to an hour, expected for a Friday night.

35mins later our pizza and beer shows up. The delivery guy was a little off, maybe had a ""pick me up"" to get through his shift, but needless to say, he did his job in a timely matter.

The pizza was amazing!!! Hot, Fresh, Good Crust. I never eat crust, and I killed this crust. Yeah, Clean plate club over here. It even heats up well.

Most of the reviews are not good, but we tried this place before even reading a review and we loved it. I say, give it another shot.

We had 2 waitresses help us and they were both fantastic. Super friendly and very much on top of it all.  They were quick and not hiding.  Bravo to the girl from Indianapolis!  The food was great too. Had the duck pate and a bowl of cauliflower soup. Both delicious. I had a special of grouper filet on top of saute spinach. It was good, but not super fantastic. probably needed a bit more seasoning for my taste.  My wife had a bowl of mussels. They tasted good but had one problem: they were super miniature.  These things were the size of a dime at best and not the larger variety you find everywhere else. Will not order them again.  Overall, had a great experience and the service and good food were pleasing enough to warrant regular visits.",2

They put fresh lobster on poutine, tacos, rolls, mac n cheese, etc. All perfectly prepared. Want just a lobster? They do that as well.

Also, when we went, they had a lobsterlicious menu where you can get an app, main, and desert for 25 bucks!

Also, they usually have daily deals as well. taco tuesday, whole lobster sunday, etc. 

Don't forget to addon a lobster caesar as well. The only drink you will have with a lobster tail sticking out of it. 

Lobster not your thing? Don't worry they have alternative options like crab! They also have seafood plates, soups, etc. But if you are coming to a lobster place, get the lobster!

It was okay, and the bun was fantastic, but I wasn't thrilled with the burger at all. It was in serious need of having some flavour added to it. I was pretty much starving, so it filled the hole in my stomach, but considering how hungry I was... I feel like I should have liked it more not less.

I don't think Fresh is ever going to quite win me over. The service was quite good, especially considering how busy they were but the food was mostly meh.

My friend ordered a green bowl with tempeh and it looked tasty and she seemed okay with it, so maybe I'll try one of those next time.

This center is very family friendly. Like the Y, the focus is on fitness, not what you're wearing. Our kids have enjoyed their introductory orientation, and the flexibility to use the facilities at an age 3 years younger compared to our former gym. Family here is a priority.

The sports trainers are very knowledgeable and have your best interests in mind. We were very pleased to work with a corrective exercise specialist who listened to each member of our family and provided a thoughtful appropriate workout to each of our needs. We so appreciated the thoughtful service, which isn't ""based on a sell.""

Great class instructors who know their specialty. So far, I've only taken yoga and tai chi classes, and am pleased that the individuals they hire are experienced and able to work with a wide-ranging demographic of ages and abilities.

Facilities are clean and well-maintained.

Aquatics: As a swimmer with a changing work schedule, I appreciate the available swim hours and the pool temperature!

Normally this area of a restaurant does not provide the most stellar of service but our bartender, Chris, was on point. He often checked up on us and made sure to glance over once in a while as well. 

We started off with the wagyu steak tartar. The fat ratio coated our mouths and when paired with the Ermitage M. Chapoutier 1997 it was heaven. Although I was getting full by this stage we continued with their New York Strip, bleu cheese scalloped potatoes, and the creamed corn. I am glad we split because I would have gone into a coma. The steak was melt in your mouth tender. Cooked to a medium and I was not ready to throw in the towel. 

By the time dessert rolled around, I was about to die. The chocolate cake with spiced cherries was decent. It was a concentrated brick of decadence. I am not always a chocolate person, which made this too much for me. The strawberry pavlova was the highlight for me. The chef takes a classic dish normally eaten in Australia and New Zealand and puts his spin on it. I have tried this dessert a few times while traveling abroad and never liked it. It tends to be too sweet. Stripsteak's version was a more mellow presentation. Before presentation a strawberry jus is poured over the fresh fruit. The combination of that with the basil ice cream is magnificent. We had also got the beignets with a McCallan 18 caramel which I didn't care for.

I contacted platinum paint and body they told me to come in and they would take a look at it. When I came in the owner Alfredo was not available so I had a lady take some pictures and take my information and they told me they would call me. Two weeks later I still have no phone call so I called them only to get a voicemail. I left them a message with my name and number and asked for a callback. Two days goes by and still no phone call. I finally called them this morning and was told to contact Alfredo directly because they are too busy to give callbacks. When I contacted Alfredo he told me that my part isn't a good part and that he doesn't like to paint those and that I should take it off my car and send it back to the manufacturer. I asked him why he didn't tell me this at the beginning and he tells me that I was only leasing the car and didn't need it to last long. I told Alfredo I leased the car for three years not for six months. Conversation ended when he told me to take the part off and send it back to the manufacturer. I will never use platinum paint and body again and will never recommend them to anybody else. I will however let people know what happened if asked.

If you don't know what to get you can never go wrong with California Rolls.But here is a list of good Maki Rolls to try and what they have in them.Note this list contains some of my favs. ^.^

*California Roll
Cucumber,Smoke Salmon, Avocado,

*Ichiban
Eel,Smoke Salmon, Cucumber, Avocado, Yummy Tempura Sauce

*Shrimp Tempura
Breaded Shrimp, Cucumber, Avocado, Yummy Tempura Sauce

*Salmon Roll kinda simple Smoke Salmon lol.

If your not into Sushi you must try one of their delicious Teriyaki Dishes or a Noodle bowl.But I'll tell you now Pacific East is not for the faint of heart who is afraid and shake in their boots at the idea of eating raw or semi-cooked seafood.

I've worked in the industry and appreciate the small things. The staff makes you feel at home the second you walk in the door. Food quality is unparalleled. This is the rare place where you want to order the ""special"" each day unlike most trying to move old product.  Fantastic beer selection with rotating local taps. The GM, Josh, does a great job running a tight ship. This is not only a place I take my parents when visiting in town, but also a spot to meet with friends for a bite and catch the game just the same. 3 words to summarize the experiences I've had:  Best in Class.",2
9886,1,1549929600000,"I was visiting back home and saw this place just opened and thought it looked cute. Never again. First of all, I saw someone walking around with Duncan Hines cake mix. For $3.75, I can buy my own cake mix, eggs, and canola oil and make my own cupcakes. They'd probably have better frosting. I got the cookie monster cupcake--white cake and white frosting with Oreos mixed in.  The frosting was greasy, grainy, and poorly mixed--seriously, there were chunks of butter in it. Disgusting. I'm never going back.",2

We were not disappointed!  We were greeted immediately by a friendly staff and seated promptly despite being very busy in a small restaurant.  David's was decorated with Armed Forces memorabilia and catered to Vets which I found endearing. 

They accommodated my small children and even my grandmother who uses a walker. 

We ate there three times during our stay and each service was top notch.   The food is all made from scratch and portions were rather large despite normal prices. Notable was the jalapeño cornbread, super fresh fruit cups, and pancakes.  Honestly, everything from the omelets, bacon, sausage, home fries, and even the toast was excellent!   I'll be returning again.",2

My coffee cup was dirty and had to ask for a clean one, it took three trips for my server to get a clean one. I ordered Ham Steak and over medium eggs.
My ham was super dried out and the eggs were over hard. My Husband ordered Chorizo and eggs he recalled that it was just alright nothing special.
We were trying this place out and found it a little lacking. The Management and staff greet you from the opening of there door but service drops off there. I only was offered coffee at the beginning of my order and I had to ask each time I wanted more.
Breakfast for two was 35.00 plus tip.",2

All of her friends raved about the different flavors we had, such as : salted butter caramel swirl which they are known for, Belgian chocolate, Jamison Irish cream, honey lavender, white rose, and two fresh fruit sorbets. All the batches are handmade and you can tell that a lot of thought goes into the flavors, the texture, natural ingredients and spices, and just the general creaminess of this ice cream. We like to support local and we definitely suggest you go and try some different flavors for yourself. Neat thing to know they also carry different flavors depending on the season.",2

It came with ham which was okay.. but I don't really like ham to begin with. It also had two small buttermilk biscuit which was so cute and really one of the best biscuits I tried. I also ordered fries with my meals but it was just potatoes. My friend ordered pear cactus drink which smelled really strong but it wasn't.

I think they may have changed owners and chefs because this place has gone downhill pretty quickly.  The pho broth isnt as beefy anymore.  The meat tastes like it was freezer burned and just thrown into the bowl.  The service was sub-par and i got sick after eating there so hopefully they will do something about it.  Definitely the loss of a great gem in that neighborhood.,2

I have been a patient of Dr Rubin and his PA Aaron now for almost two years.
I was involved in a very serious accident that has left me with significant pain and discomfort. I was bounced around from doctor to doctor through our wonderful health insurance system until I was finally professionally referred to Dr Rubin.
Trust me when I say I HAVE been through it all. Doctors to therapists and back to doctors. MRI's, cat scans, trigger injections and epidurals...
And NOBODY has been as professional, caring, sympathetic and effective as Dr Rubin and his PA Aaron at CPR.
Today almost two years later I am at least able to manage and  make it through a day with the help of them. Yes sure I still have ongoing pain and discomfort but with them I have hope and see a light at the end of tunnel.

We waited for one hour to get a table. The room was freezing. The waitress was very rude. It took forever to get the menu and wait for your order. The restaurant is obviously incapable to handle those many guests. The waitress ignored us for several times and when we stopped her, she told us she is so tired and worked for more than 10 hours. Maybe this is another consequence after they faked the rate here.",2

We tried one of every kind they had on the menu, and ended up only enjoying the sesame. The garlic was AWFUL: encrusted with sharp burnt bits of garlic that tasted like bitter smoke, and stank up the whole car and whoever held the bag.

Sunday morning was madness, with rough pushing to the front, and I felt rushed by the staff. I didn't realize that if you ask for cream cheese, they spread it on for you, and if you want a tub, you have to ask someone to run around to the back fridge to get it. Overall, Fairmount is 3.5 stars in my book. I really wish we had driven just a block or so over to SV.",2

Their collection of Ancient art is outstanding. Especially their small Roman household art and sculpture. The museum is free but their is a modest charge for the Jazz Age Exhibit.  Double highly recommend.",2

I decided to give their chef salad a whirl. After the uncomfortable transaction with the lady at the register that refuses eye contact or even the slightest acknowledgment of your existence as a customer, I waited anxiously for the salad I so inconsiderately requested. When the time came, I shoved my way to the front of the line like a MAGA hat wearer at a Trump rally and clutched my prized salad with complete caution as I made my way back to my tiny, cramped table. Upon initial inspection, I felt like I had been done right by the bountiful portions of deli meat the Rinaldi's gods had bestowed upon me. After three bites I realized the roast beef was still bleeding. Like, bleeding.... I haven't seen that much raw meat since the first time I saw a Peter North film (see pic for meat reference). I didn't bother to complain or ask for a refund. I figure I'd be better off never going back and flushing the $40-50 a month I spend down an actual toilet would be better for me.  Long story short, if you need a reason to take a day off work to nurse your b-hole and don't mind feeling like one when you patronize small business, this is the place.

9979,3,1550534400000,Very unprofessional treatment today. Called at 2:00 to make sure they delivered to our address and the person who answered said yes. Called at 5:00 and was told that they do not deliver to me despite the fact that I was told they do earlier and that their website advertises a 3 mile delivery radius and I live less than 3 miles away. Additionally the girl who put me on hold simply put the phone down on the counter so I could hear her saying disparaging things about me while I waited for her to get back to me. I'd recommend finding another place that values their customers. There are LOTS of them here in the Burgh!,2
9981,1,1551225600000,"I can only speak about mornings at Sip Coffee & Beer Garage but I'll have to check it out in the evenings some time too. I enjoyed my first visit here about a year ago with a friend. I really liked the concept of the converted service station ( like another favorite of mine: Copper Star ). Yesterday I was riding around on the motorcycle, trying to decide on a coffee spot to read and relax and Sip popped into my head, so I made my way down there. I was a bit apprehensive that it would be too crowded on a Saturday morning around 8:30 ( I typically prefer an earlier start ) but I was really pleased that there was plenty of room to grab a nice table and settle in. 

You order your stuff at the bar area, which looks like a good spot on those upcoming beer night excursions to come. I ordered an Americano and decided on the breakfast burrito to go along with. The staff was friendly and my coffee was made quickly. The folks behind the counter seemed cheerful and efficient. Settling in with my book it was just a short time before my breakfast showed up. As breakfast burritos go, it definitely hit the spot but didn't jump out in any particular area. That said, I'd definitely try it again. Salsa on the side was tasty and had just enough of a kick. The tortilla wrap was nice and tight with just enough crispness. 

Sip has a nice open feeling inside. Tables are of various sizes and spaced far enough apart so you never really feel crowded. There's a spacious outdoor patio area as well, along with some seating out front. The music overhead was not too loud and wasn't overbearing. Overall, I really like the vibe of Sip and I'll be returning again pretty soon. It's definitely worth the trip down from North Phoenix. Recommended.",2
9982,1,1550534400000,"Would love to buy this place.  It is very inconsistent with the food, has cleanliness issues in the dining room and bathroom.

I often order my sandwich on a bagel.  Its 50/50 that it is made that way.  Would love to get what I order and pay for.

This place needs a deep cleaning and then have a cleaning schedule put together.  But things are more simple than that.  Today there was part of newspaper laying on the floor and one of the employees stepped over the paper to walk behind the counter.  She had to actually step over the papers in order to get behind the counter.  She couldn't simply bend down and pick up the papers?

I would love to buy this place and fix it.",2
9983,3,1549324800000,"I'm a huge Bobby Flay fan so couldn't wait to try Mesa Grill when we visited Vegas recently. The reservation system is a bit of a pain, you call a central line for everything at Caesars and then have to say the name of the property that you are trying to make a reservation for. I had to call a couple of times because we had to make a change to our reservation, and every time it sent me to the wrong place on the first 1 or 2 tries. I was finally able to successfully connect to the correct reservations folks though and once I got through everything went smoothly. 

We had a party of 6 and everyone loved their meal. Our friends were ordering wine by the glass and the server recommended a very nice bottle instead which was surprisingly affordable. Everyone loved their meal. 

My DH and I started with the shrimp tamales since there were so many recommendations for them here and they are 1 of the 2-3 items that the waiter said have been on the menu since day 1. I thought they were very good, but wasn't blown away by them. Then we shared the coffee rubbed rib eye and the green chili cauliflower. both were outstanding. The steak was nicely charred on the outside and perfectly medium rare. The rub had a combination of savory and sweet in it and there were 2 sauces. A spicy green sauce and some kind of red sauce. They were both very good but the green on was my favorite. The cauliflower was to die for! I also had tastes of the salmon which was perfectly cooked and had a really lovely sauce and the pork tenderloin which has a very tasty rub. The fish portions seemed to be about average size, but the pork and steak portions were huge. our steak was 22 ounces, which was plenty for the 2 of us. 

Mesa Grill is definitely worth a second visit.",2

They offer pizza, tasty salads, panini's, and pastas. I have only tried the pizza and salads, but I have been very happy with both. They also have a huge selection of wines to choose from.

The pizzas do somewhat remind me of Italian pizza, just a crisper crust. They have some very unique pizza flavors at Sauce. Last time I ate there we tried the  Rosemary potato, spinach, feta, and olive pizza. I was a bit hesitant about the potatoes, but it turned out to be really good. 

I have to admit Sauce was a bit over hyped, but still the food is good and I really like the relaxed atmosphere!",2

I added a side of guac ($1) and lots of salsa and hot sauce. The dish came with a side of something (maybe jicama?) that was crispy and fresh and had a sweet heat to it. No homefries, but I stole some from my friends so can attest that they were crispy and flavourful!

We drank coffee because it was morning(ish) and the costs of the cocktails here were a little extreme. They were big comforting mugs of coffee that kept coming, so that was nice. We sat on the patio by the pool and watched three different kinds of birds go insane stealing all the leftover tortilla chips (complimentary) from tables as soon as people got up. They swooped so low they almost hit us each in the face at least once. It was quite entertaining. The pigeons in Vegas make the ones back home in Toronto look like doves. And I have never seen our sparrows behave in such a scavengeresque manner. Vegas really does bring out the worst in everybody doesn't it? haha. 

Anyway, I love the dirty, dry humour of this place. Staying in Hard Rock, I was greeted to the inappropriate but welcome messaging each day. A fave said, ""Where pink tacos are not just a phase in college!"" Do it up. Get your pink tacos. You're in Vegas after all!",2

My sister wanted me to try their Outlaw bourbon drink - but they had just taken it off the menu. Too bad too. Sounds amazing with smoke and bitters. Happy hour has good drink specials, but a limited bar menu. We enjoyed house chardonnay with an order of unlimited seasoned popcorn, while husband opted for a heartier burger from the bar menu. The burger smelled fantastic and he did say it was good, except for the really thick slice of velveeta on it. Great if you like that sort of thing. Burger comes with fries, on a toasted bun with crispy bacon.

10038,3,1549497600000,"By far, my favorite hotel/casino in Vegas. It is off the strip, but the rooms are a bargin for the quality. Most of them have been recently remodeled too.

The one big draw back of the Hilton is the Buffet. It's not that big and the food is alright. Although you can get better food at another buffet, it's alright. Their fine dining restaurants are pretty good though.

The spa is great, the staff is friendly and personalbe. They are also reasonably priced and have many addtionaly amenities. They offer a range of massages, facials and body wraps/scrubs. There is a small gym, wet and dry saunas, a steam room and a jacuzzi. Very relaxing.

The casino is not that big, but the staff is very personable. You don't have to wander through miles of slot machines to find the pit. Due to the scaled down size, they don't have some of the newer or more obscure table games that some of the large strip casinos have, but a good selection nonetheless.

The securities are very rude wanna be rent a cops. Here's what happened, first of let me just say that I'm only 20 (but I look like I'm 16) and I know I'm not supposed to be on the casino floor or anywhere near the slots and tables but it was my boyfriends first time here and he got on a slot and I was taking a picture, for memories you know and  I was gonna go up to our room after the picture, two big fat security women come up to me like if they were trying to intimidate me, chest out hands on hips all on my face, they asked me if I'm 21, obviously I said no, and they begin to scold me that I'm not allowed anywhere near the slots or tables or else I will get fined of get sent to prison, chill out rent a cop I was already on my way upstairs, they were very rude and could've handled that in a different way. The rooms are okay outdated, needs some updating, the bed was comfy, though I was really scared to sleep in the bed due to the reviews of bed bugs but I was really tired our first night and slept really well. The second night though I woke up in the middle of the night with my legs sooooo itchy, I couldn't stop scratching, I had little bumps all over both my legs. On our last night there my boyfriend was down stairs gambling and drinking and when he tried to get a drink at the bar the bar tender was being ass hole with him, he asked for my boyfriends ID he hands it to him and my boyfriend said that he kept looking at the picture on the ID and back at him lifted into the light inspected it and told my boyfriend if he had another proof of identification, my boyfriend said no and the bartender told him that he couldn't serve him liquor, very rude and u fortunate for my boyfriend seeing that he only wanted one more drink before going up to the room being it was our last night there The parking was a hassle because they were cleaning the parking garage. The hotel is very old and could use a major upgrade all around.

10045,3,1550448000000,"This place hasn't changed at all over the years.  Nonetheless, management has changed a while ago and so did their service. Got mixed feelings  for this restaurant as my friend burned himself with their onion soup. This happened because the waiter or the restaurant itself failed to notice the customer in any kind of ways that the side of the plate would be burning hot . Needless to say , this was a pretty serious mistake from the waiter . Neither him or the manager itself could apologize to my friend saying that was an accident and it wasn't their fault. Like I said things have changed in that restaurant..

Recently , I have given the opportunity to redeem itself from the previous occasion . This time it was not a flop , the waitress was very attentive to our needs . My buddy and I enjoyed our smoke meat poutine , although I found it a bit too salty ... It was still a very good meal and I could rate it 7.5/10

I have concluded that this restaurant is still an excellent choice for late night snacking if one is in the area. Note that they don't serve their 24hours breakfast between 2-5am ;)",1

The prices are very reasonable.  I had a chicken salad croissant chips, drink, and cupcake.  You can also choose a cookie instead of a cupcake.  Everything I had including the ice tea was delicious.

10053,1,1549065600000,"One of the oldest Spring Training complexes in Arizona is also one of the best.  Situated just outside of Old Town Scottsdale, Scottsdale Stadium offers a great place to watch a game as well as a location that begs you to go out after it is over.

Getting to Scottsdale Stadium can be a bit of a pain.  It is a few miles from the freeway and almost requires that you deal with Scottsdale traffic.  If you take Earll to Civic Center and then merge on to Drinkwater, you should be able to find either street parking or library parking for free.  The dirt lots on the east side of the stadium should be avoided.  Also, the Trolley goes by the stadium so you can park anywhere along the line and catch it.

Once you try to walk into Scottsdale Stadium, you will notice the food bank collection going on at each gate.  This is not voluntary.  You will be required to drop off everything eatable or drinkable (except closed water bottles) before you can enter.  This, of course, should prepare you to empty your wallet once you are inside.

The concrete concourse obstructs the field which is a big hindrance but the area down the foul lines and the entire outfield berm has a clear view from the concourse.  That is where most of the good food is located anyways so you can stay out from behind the concrete monster.  There are plenty of food vendors and usually a nice broad selection of beers & cocktails.  

Seating in Scottsdale is some of the best.  The berm seating has a huge slope and features large shade trees.  This makes for the best grass seating in the Cactus League.  The regular seats are a bit on the smaller side but almost all of them are close to the field and have good views.

The practice field is beyond the right field wall.  Usually, this means the visiting team takes BP on the main field making this a great place for autographs.  If you were to want a Giant to autograph something, they all come down the first base line and most will stop and sign.  Don't expect to have access to the practice field beyond standing behind a chain link fence.

This stadium has hosted so many teams over the years, it is too bad the terrible Giants play there now.  Ignoring that fact, Scottsdale Stadium is a great place to catch a game, especially if you are in the East Valley.",2

I am not much of a cigar smoker, but he has nice walk in humidor and is becoming quite well known as a source of high quality cigars.

I ordered the apple brandy cocktail and it was amazing! Not too sweet. For dinner we ordered the white fish bon mi and brown bag chicken sandwich with Mac and cheese and sweet potato fries. The fries were sweet and salty, with what seems to be house made ketchup. The Mac and cheese needed pepper. The bon mi has refreshing. Not served on a French roll, but definitely something I would get again. The chicken sandwich is a cold sandwich, filled with nuts and fruit... Delicious. I was blown away when I went to the restroom and there was a line... The employees in line let me cut ahead! The music played was hip/alternative; added to the environment.

The facilities are nicer than most which is always a nice factor in your decision to pay for a car wash. I usually get the top end car wash, hand wax and interior protection option. They usually will drop this wash down to $46 if you ask which is more than a ten dollar savings. I don't recommend going on a Saturday morning because it is very busy and they end up taking over an hour to compete the wash. 
The wash itself is pretty good but I recommend checking your car thoroughly before you drive away because in my case they are very good at the obvious but not the best at the finer details inside the car. I have had to ask to have my windows redone due to a few small smears on the front and rear. They also seem to forget about the cup holders in both cars they wipe them but don't really clean them and that goes for all the small areas inside your car.

I called and it went to a voicemail system that hadn't been setup. I called a couple other places that also close at 6 and no one answered the phone there either. A few minutes later I got a call back from Desert Wireless (assuming missed call-caller ID). I explained the situation and they told me to come down by 5:30, it takes 1/2 hour to fix. I got a call back from another company but My boyfriend has used Desert Wireless several times in the past so we decided to stay loyal. They are a little more expensive than other places and far from where we live but no issues in the past (and awesome, they told us to come down 'it would be no problem'). 
We were there at 5:30 like they suggested. My boyfriend walked in the door, wasn't greeted for about 7 minutes (despite the door alarm alerting them someone had walked in). He then hit the bell. The guy said ""be right out"". He came out 10 min later and he asked if he was picking up. My boyfriend said ""no, we called about the iPhone 6, you told us to come down"". He said ""oh, well what time was that?"" My boyfriend said ""5:30, I've been waiting here"". The guy said ""okay, let me go check"". Two more customers walk in then another guy walks in the door and asks if he's been helped. The other walks out and says it's too late now and he can't fix his phone tonight.  My boy friend was pissed, gave them a piece of his mind, and left at 6pm. Now he is going on his trip in the morning to the middle of nowhere for a week with a broken phone. 
 Worst part, I had a call back from another company who also closed at 6pm but I told them we decided to go with Desert Wireless. Now EVERY other place is closed and now we have ZERO options before he leaves on his business trip. 

WORST.SERVICE.EVER. 


Great way to treat loyal customers who have referred family and friends to your business. Good thing for us there are A LOT more businesses out there who will take care of iPhone fixes and I'm sure they'll appreciate the thousand dollars in repairs we have spent with this ungrateful company.

I used to like to go to the North Scottsdale Einstein's up there, especially on the weekends. 

For those of you who know Noah's Bagels, Einstein's is something like that. They have usually about 16 or 20 different flavored bagels, and serve sandiches, salads, coffees and other beverages. 

They make a good Lox and Bagels, with your choice of bagel. They toast it for you, give you cream cheese and capers, red onions, and slices of tomatoes. I love this from Einsteins. I like it on the Asiago cheese flavored bagels. 

They also have their own ice tea blend, which they call ""Spontenai Tea. It only comes in one size, has a refreshing tea flavor mixed with fruit flavors and ginger. 

They can make most of the specialty coffee drinks that  you find at that place with the little brown mermaid with no bra on.

The salad arrived with the banana peppers. Since someone from the back delivered it he probably didn't realize I had ordered it without them but nbd I just pulled them out. In doing that I saw two fruit flies - one swarming above the dish and one literally crawling around the edge of the plate. I understand that happens so just shoo'ed them away and tried to pretend it didn't happen. The red onions were all slimy/ like mush. The chicken seemed fine so I decided to just eat that (since server was no where to be found anyway) and avoid the salad.

The only possible knock is the dining room, although sleek and modern with an amazing architectural tree house in the middle, is in the mall.  Even though this mall has the highest of high end shops, it still feels a bit like your eating in a mall. No biggee for me, just something to consider.

Food:
Steak 5 stars - ribeye was an excellent cut and perfectly prepared
Salad 5 stars - really simple but well done
Wine list and our selection - 5 star - great bottle at reasonable price
Desert - butter cake?  10 stars - best desert I have ever had - our group talked about it the rest of the trip

Polite, professional and well trained.  What you get in a AAA five diamond restaurant.  Mastros should be proud.  This is even more rare than great food.

Your choices are to walk (20 mins), or take a ride. If you take a ride you have taxis, shuttles and limos. Taxis are overpriced for such a short ride (even to fremont st.). Limos are only for ballers. If you are looking for a review of a shuttle service on Yelp, you might not be a baller.

Anyway, once you get your bag from baggage claim and get outside into the dry heat (mmmmm heat!), you will be presented by a few shuttle services. The closest one to the door is the most expensive. Drag your coke drinking, HFCS consuming butt right down to Nevada Coaches. Give them 9 bucks and enjoy the ride.",2

We go there at least once a week- they do offer sugar free and non fat also-
The unique thing about this place is that they swirl chopped up candy into their vanilla ice cream (cant with chocolate unfortunately.. but CAN do it with their shakes! ) My personal favorites are vanilla with Andes Candes or Reese's pieces- you can also get more than one candy per cone-
My fave- milkshake- chocolate with Oreo!

Having never been to this side of the strip, we decided to venture out and see what's around the hotel.  So lucky to find this have found Thai restaurant.  Ordered beef noodle, chicken yellow curry, and papaya salad.  All tasted very good  with large portions.  The price is down right cheap.  Other reviewers mentioned slow service, but we didn't experience that, maybe different time of day.  

One thing to note, they ask you to rate the spiciness from 1-10.  I got a 3 for the papaya salad, it was already too spicy for me.  So be careful, always better to add later if you are not sure.",2
10362,3,1549411200000,"I like this place, I like what they're doing, but they desperately need to season their food and make the ordering a little more customer friendly. 

The whole plate ($10) is a good deal with 1 main and 2 sides but for some reason some of the salads are considered premium salads so there's an extra charge for those. I've had it a few times and I can't seem to figure out any rhyme or reason to which salads are premium. Seems kind of arbitrary but all the salads have been really good. 

I've had the chicken salad sandwich a couple times and it's been great each time! The hot items could really use some seasoning, especially the potatoes (mashed and roasted) and the soup. Smoothies are nice too.",2

First, one salad was brought out for 7 people, we asked for another, has that simply not enough. The second salad arrived with entries, the order of one of the party was pretty late. I ordered herbal chicken, it was not cooked right and did not taste good. 
We had 2 waitresses since it is a large party and still could not get a good service.

The receptionists were pretty nice, but I felt that they could be friendlier. Once inside, the assistant asked me to draw in my eyebrows how I normally do it and she just made it even for me. Min eventually took me to a different room where I would be getting the 3D eyebrow tattoo. She put numbing cream on it and left me for about 5 minutes. She came back soon after and began tattooing my eyebrow. Even with the numbing cream, it hurt! And I've gotten tattoos on my body before. So that's something to consider. Also, the bed where I was laying down on was directly in front of the light, so my eyes were getting really sensitive from the light and the pain from the needle. After about 30 minutes later, she finally finished and I was really happy with the result!! It will be very dark and sore at first, but it will go away.

Flavors were amazing and there was a ride range of toppings to keep it interesting. The concept of the brand and a menu tour were done to perfection by the guy up front.

Some suggestions to make it even better: 1) Find a way to label the toppings. Some were obvious what they were, but most it was hard to tell. I felt guilty asking about each one. I can imagine that it could potentially hold up the line when the restaurant is very busy. 2) Add something SPICY. The Spicy Hummus and Harissa weren't kicking enough for me.

Lets be clear, this place is 100% one of my favorites in Vegas. That's why I am so critical. 

First of all, I have zero complaints about food. Chris Santos had created a beautiful menu with a little something for everyone. This place will leave you satisfied and wanting more all at the same time. 

Lighting- I understand they were going for a very noir feel, however, it's like eating in a closet. There's almost no light and it makes the presentation of these wonderful dishes really fall flat. 

As far as the drinks, They need to step it up a notch in order to meet the menu standards. Cocktails were strange selections to pair with the dishes, and wine list was lacking a few that every good list should require. 

The communication between staff, and menu knowledge needs to improve as we had to clarify orders twice. 

With a few small changes, I really believe this place can be top notch.",2
10436,3,1549065600000,"Having enjoyed lunch here several times, I picked Chinato as a pre-theater dinner destination on the Tuesday of Restaurant Week. The place was packed on a Tuesday night which added great energy to the place. Several things derailed the experience. First, the restaurant was out of both Malbec and Pinot Noir by the glass. Seriously? Open another bottle and sub it. But no. The boyfriend had the pork belly app and one of the pieces was stone cold. Ugh. My salmon app was completely tasteless shredded salmon in some kind of runny mayo based binder. Only took a few bites. The boyfriend's hanger steak on greens earned good reviews from him. My fluke was just OK. Nicely breaded but under seasoned by a mile. Some kind of mashed something accompanied it and some rock hard slices of beets. Now, the lemon polenta cake as outstanding. Really good flavor, nice texture. We loved it. The apple tart was warm and comforting with a nice chewy texture. Service was slow to slower and then slowest.

I realize there's a risk dining during Restaurant Week but I view it as an opportunity to showcase what a restaurant can do...in this case, not much.",3

Most korean places would serve you extra for free. 

My mother and sister ordered fried rice. The portions were terrible and I thought it didn't even smell that good when it was delivered. It looked like something I could've easily batched up for under 2 dollars, though in much higher quantities. 

It gets even worse when they automatically add 18% gratuity when the service is virtually non-existent. Turned what was a 36 dollar meal in to a 50 dollar meal after gratuity and taxes. Terrible.",3

They put a ""special request"" sign on it, at no extra cost, and sure enough they were steaming it when I got there the next morning and it was ready to go! 

Based on this one experience, Avalon seems to be very accommodating and they have terrific prices -- $2.25 per item. I'll definitely be going back. Also, they are located on the north EAST corner of Ray and Rural, not NW like the previous review states.

Maybe I can ask for light ice.

When I ordered, I specifically asked if the soup was a good portion. Said yes, yes. good.  Uh ok....the container wasn't even all the way full & the chips taste a bit stale.  The mild salsa that was given, not even half full in this small container.  They weren't very friendly-the only one who smiled was the man behind the bar.  

The soup is good and ordered a side as well.  The portions are not what I would call standard or even decent.  I wish El Cancun was still open, sad they closed, because when you ordered any food, you got what you paid for!  Looks like I will be searching for another Mexican restaurant.",2

Although the selection is not as vast as the farmers markets that I had access to when I lived in Santa Monica, California- Fresh 52 does a pretty good job considering we are in the middle of a desert.  

I love coming on Saturday mornings with my family.  We grab breakfast at Leone Cafe, let the kids exert some energy on the playground, then visit our favorite vendors  to purchase delicious fruits and veggies for the week.  I bought some delicious asparagus, cauliflower, and garlic from the Gilcrease Orchard. ""Herbs by Diane"" was there with a vast selection and I purchased a bag of sage and apple mint.  I also bought a jar of honey and a handful of honey sticks of different flavors. (I can't wait to brew a cup of apple mint tea and sweeten it with honey).  

In addition to the produce vendors, there are also craft vendors.  None of them are really my cup of tea, but it is always fun to walk around and peruse. There is also a flower vendor and he had a nice selection of cut flowers.  I was surprised to also see a vendor selling Vietnamese food.  The line was really long, so I'll have to check it out another time.  There are crafts and face painting for the kids.  And live music to groove to while you stroll Tivoli Village on a beautiful Saturday.  

Considering that we live in the desert-  It is so nice to know that I can get fresh produce ""52"" weeks of the year and support our local farmers at the same time!",3

10528,1,1550534400000,"I have frequented this place all throughout the school year, and I think I can confidently say that Papa Ceo is one of my favourite pizza places in the area.  I fail to recall a time when I left disappointed.

Venue:  There really isn't anything fancy about this place.  It's pretty old and the sitting area consists of several metal table/chair combo fixtures you might find in older mall food courts.  They are pushed right up to the wall so it can difficult to access sometimes should you decide to sit near the wall.  The staff keep the area decently clean, but sometimes I think it could be cleaner.  This has never really bothered me personally, but don't expect much should you decide to dine in.  In terms of their hours and location, Papa Ceo is easily accessible to U of T students in the area and are open quite late, closing at around 3-4 am most days of the week.  

Food:  If you are looking for slices, they offer 8-9 different kinds of pies you can choose from (availability can vary depending how quickly they sell) and range from your traditional margherita to unique flavours like clam chowder.  I've probably tried them all and haven't found one I disliked.  The pizza is made New York style (thin crust).  I find the crust to be crisp on the outside yet kinda fluffy and soft on the inside which is something I really like in a crust.  At $4.50 a slice (tax in) the portion size is more than generous (seriously, it's like a quarter of a pizza) and easily fills you up for lunch or dinner.  If slices aren't your thing, they offer a few deals for full pies and a long list of different toppings to choose from.  For what you get, i'd say their prices are quite fair.

Customer Service:  While staff come and go, the quality of service has always been great.  Definitely more than I would expect from a pizza place.  Every time I've walked in, everyone seemed happy, friendly, and were smiling.  They've always greeted me when I walked in and thanked me as I walked out the door.  It doesn't seem like much, but when you've had a rough/crap day (and believe me I've had many this year), it's the little things like this that really help make the day just a bit more bearable (well, at least for me).

Overall, Papa Ceo is a great pizza place.  Despite the appearance of the venue, I think the quality, price, and size of the pizza is great.  I highly recommend giving this place a try if you are in the area.",2
10534,2,1550188800000,"Smoke n mirrors.  Last week I noticed my new Cox Cable/internet account (which had been set up for automatic monthly payment) had not been debited from my bill payment account.  Even though it was after hours I called CS at Cox to find out what had happened. By now I knew my account had to be past due...even though when I spoke to Cox nearly a month and half ago to make sure it was set up properly, it was confirmed.  Today, after being on the phone with Cox Ifor over 44 minutes i found out the following:  my account had not been set up correctly by Cox.  The CS rep told me that I owed two months and she would correct the error immediately. She also wanted to transfer me to billing so that i could make the past due payment AND my Oct 26th payment immediately and it would only cost $10.00.  I told the rep I would not pay that fee and then she told me there was a late fee accrued and added to Oct bill for previous month. I asked why I had to pay a LATE fee of nearly $9.00 and why I had to pay Oct bill not due until end of month. She told me that that was the only way. I told her I would also not pay the late fee as the whole problem was Cox fault. She then told me she could Waive the two fees.  I asked her why she did not offer to do so before she told me to pay the bill immediately, especially as the whole issue was Cox fault. She did not have an answer. Even though I felt conned by fox I paid the past due AND the third month in advance and made suremy account was now set up correctly. Then I asked to speak to a CS Manager. After waiting on the phone for 25 minutes a manager came on the phone. I described the above scenario. She was very polite and kept apologizing for the error.  I requested that she carry forward a message to the CEO/etc of Cox that perhaps they should spend less money on their advertising and more on hiring CS managers.  Also Cox has to put on my/your bill that they WAIVED late fee and bill payment fee. That makes Cox appear to be philanthropic (doing a favor) even though they were the cause of the problem. These items appear on account receivable as line items that will eventually add up to a monthly/quarterly/annual report that indicates a loss to the bottom line.  Guess what a LOSS does for Cox taxes.  Nickle/diming customers and not including a line item for ""Oops we made a mistake"" in an industry that has inflated prices, charging fees for their mistakes and then backtracking, in an industry that is losing ground...SHAME on you.

10549,2,1549152000000,"Came here for lunch today with my family and it was a terrible experience overall. 

First of all, the lunch buffet pricing is misleading as $12.99 only includes the hot/cold side dishes, no dumplings! If you want to boil your own dumplings, the price is $16.99, which is the same as it is for dinner. However, when I looked at the paper menu, it clearly states $14.99 for dumplings. They also boast about having 11 types of dumplings - I counted only 8? 

Now, for the hot stations: there were a few dishes that always seemed empty, and when asked by my mother if they would be refilled, our server just awkwardly smiled and said they've already made quite a few batches so we're basically out of luck. 

Lastly, there's an automatic 10% tip that wasn't communicated to us until our bill came. Pretty smart business strategy by them given that the subpar service and misleading pricing would not have warranted a tip from us whatsoever.

Sangria was strong and very good.  We ordered their seafood/cheese rolls as an appetizer.  The rolls were perfectly crispy, with a nice amount of filling, with a nice sweet sauce to dip it in.  We ordered several rolls (the flaming phoenix, firecracker, fusion, and the Philadelphia roll).  I gotta give top marks to the originality and presentation of the flame phoenix.  The sushi was acceptable but is not going to blow anyone away whose had good sushi.  The rice was a little too chewy and the firecracker was very flimsy with its thinly sliced pieces of jalapeño.  I liked Kofusion and would definitely go back.  But its very expensive and the sushi is only ok.

10647,1,1551052800000,"I've raved before via Yelp about my birth right and taste buds from being raised as a Texan and what that means for all things beef, tex-mex and overall unhealthy. That being said, the Filet Mignon I experienced at this restaurant was in my top 3 steak experiences. Yum!!! Seriously, don't waste your time with Cut or the other over-hyped steakhouses in Vegas. True, old-world, New York City style dining in the glorious (and super sparkly) New York, New York Casino - this restaurant is a must. My steak was a perfectly cooked Medium accompanied by the macaroni & cheese (yes to the bacon flavor!) and mashed potatoes (low on over flavoring - which matches the steak perfectly). Pro-tip: don't get sauces for the steak. It's perfectly seasoned. We were obviously looking for a waist-line friendly meal. (Ha!) 

We also enjoyed the Pinot Noir from Santa Barbara wine country (started with a B but can't remember the name). The entire table split a bottle and everyone was pleased by the smooth taste (with a $48 price tag - not too shabby). Calamari for the appetizer (standard) and a Cesar Salad (it was ok but nothing special). The waiter was incredibly accommodating (my gf spilled her full glass of wine all over the table and my newly placed plate of above mentioned meal and they re-plated and replaced the sides immediately) and the overall ambiance was nice. 

Needless to say we walked into Zumanity in a food coma which was oh, so worth it!",2
10647,3,1550880000000,"A couple nights ago I went to Eddie V's for my brother's birthday. (A Thursday) He raves about this place yet I always remember the other location being just ok. Anyway, the atmosphere of the new location is nice. About what you would expect...dark and cozy, however....the bathrooms are well...creepy? There are no doors on the mens or women's bathrooms. Women can walk right by the mens bathroom and see everything. They are more like big open rooms with a sink on one side. It was eerily silent with off putting lighting. You almost feel like you're in a creepy, dank hotel lobby. I couldn't wait to get out of there and back to my table. Oh and ladies, FYI...we can hear EVERYTHING you are saying. The two bathrooms share one large space.

Ok so let's get on to the meal. Before I came to Eddie's, I checked out the yelp reviews like I always do before I go to a new restaurant and made sure to try the crab cake. And let me tell you, everyone is correct. It's DELICIOUS. I just about licked the plate clean...and i'm not even a big seafood fan. Now, on to the main course. The whole reason my brother wanted to come to Eddie's was for an amazing steak. So both he and I ordered steak. He got the special which was a bone in filet mignon and I ordered the bone out filet mignon. We like our steaks cooked medium, pink all the way thru with no red. We always ask the server, regardless of where we go, what their version of medium is. He told us that their medium would be to our liking so we trusted that an excellent steakhouse would get it right......NOPE. Both $35+ steaks came out medium rare to RARE. My filet had ribbons of fat throughout the whole thing. Horrible cut of meat. I've had better cuts of meat at Outback. ZING! Everyone knows that when you order a steak and it's not cooked properly that it just ruins your meal. By the time they re-cook the SAME piece of meat its a charred burnt crisp. I decided to just eat mine but my brother sent it back and they STILL didn't get it right. Oh, on a side note, If you DO have a problem with your meat, the manager will come over with a light BLUE LED flashlight and inspect it like a medical autopsy. I mean come on...it made the meat look purple. GROSS. As far as my poor cut of meat...the manager could only say ""we use the best cuts of meat"" really? 

Our waiter was nice, my only gripe about the service was that our plates were taken away from us from the bus boy without being asked if we were done yet. BIG NO NO. 

In conclusion, The manager took the birthday boy's steak off the check. There was no special treatment for the occasion. I read in one review that someone got a birthday card signed by all the staff. That never happened. I gave Eddie's two stars instead of one only because of the crab cake. I will never come back here for steak. I suggest sticking with the seafood items.

UPDATE:

We received a credit to come back, hoping they could cook a filet correctly. THEY DID IT AGAIN! The can not properly cook a piece of meat. End of story. 1 star now.",2

Neither my mom nor I ordered steak- that's blasphemy at a steakhouse, I know! We both ordered the Sweet Chook O' Mine (grilled chicken sandwich) with fries. We agreed it was one of the tastiest chicken sandwiches ever. It was very juicy and was covered with Swiss cheese and bacon. We also each ordered salads - I had the House salad for $2.99 and she ordered
the Signature Chopped Salad for $3.99. 

The reason why I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the luster of Outback has just dwindled over the years - and for valid reasons. This place was pretty dead for a Friday night. I used to visit Outback all the time when I was a kid. The Aussie Cheese fries appetizer used to be HUGE - now it is much smaller and the price has gone up. The same goes for the Chocolate Thunder from Down Under dessert. It used to be a humongous dessert to share. Now it is a lot smaller and is much more expensive. I glanced at the dessert menu and it seemed that most were $6.99 - I know they aren't huge slices of cake either.

Had dinner and cocktails at Oscar's, the new restaurant where Center Stage and the pool used to be. Great atmosphere, friendly staff but they need to work on a few things. Drinks were $8 and dinner ran about $50 but had I made other choices, it could easily have run $60-70 per person.

While my food was delicious (awesome double boned pork chop and creamed corn brulee), the long wait from the kitchen was terminally s-l-o-w. My dining partners complained that their food was cold (must have sat around, waiting for my pork chop to cook, because mine was hot).

I dined with six, unrelated business associates, and splitting the bill was beyond ridiculous. I would have been fine splitting the ticket six-ways but that wasn't really fair to two who were eating light, probably due to budget restraints. The server could easily have given us separate checks (come on, it's all computerized!) but of course he refused. One of the guys spent 15 minutes figuring who owed what.

For me, this Americanized, trendy style of Korean BBQ is less satisfying than the AYCE style Korean BBQ places I can find in California.

My dad, brother, my son, and myself, have also all been longtime clients. I love the way Chris cuts hair-he's not afraid to play with it. If you're looking for a trendy style, an alternative style, something fun, something simple, whatever, he can help you out. I think the prices have increased as the years have passed but that is because he has moved locations and got his own space now as opposed to being shared. I had him take care of my prom hair, he did my brother's prom hair, he's great with highlights, etc. If you're the kinda person who's like ""I want a new hairstyle BUT I cant cut it, colour it, or change my part"" then go to the mall and get a trim, but if you're the kinda person who, like me who isnt afraid to try something fun, choppy, layered, coloured etc, then go for it. 

He does such good dudes hair. Great women's cuts too obviously but every time my brother gets something done there I'm in awe. 

Besides his artistic flair, he's legitimately a great guy-fun to chat with, kind, grateful, artistic, talented. Were I the type to get my hair cut more than like once a year, I would go there more often, but alas.. poverty :P",2

For $3 at happy hour, you seriously cannot beat this price. They are incredibly strong, so I always say no to the extra shot of Cassis, but if you are feeling adventurous, it's only $1 more for the extra shot! Anytime friends come to visit from out of town, they ask if we can please go get some frozen cosmos. Apparently I talk about them a lot...

Frozen cosmos aside, the food is actually pretty good as well. I really enjoy the turkey burger filled with cranberry stuffing as well as the upstate chicken riggies. This is definitely Western PA chicken, piggie, wedding riggie gone very very right. I love the combination of vodka sauce with fresh bell peppers. And who doesn't like tots on the side? Brings me back to my childhood, stealing tots from friends at school whose parents let them buy their lunches.

I had well over a dozen large shrimp sautéed with onion and bell peppers, all served with hot tortillas.  I ate everything.  My friends ordered traditional margaritas, which they also enjoyed.

The service at the bar was very speedy; we each had 2 drinks served to us and our tab closed out just in time for our table.  When we were seated, we immediately had waters brought to us and our appetizer order taken. We ordered the cheese curds and we loved them!! I was hesitant that they might be really heavily fried and make me feel kind of gross, but they were surprisingly light and the sauce that came with them was excellent (it reminded me of a tangy honey mustard almost). 

For our entrees, I ordered the eggplant lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the Thanksgiving sandwich.  My lasagna was perfect! I was worried that it might be soggy, but it was very crispy! My boyfriend actually ended up with a turkey burger, and we aren't sure if it was maybe the way he ordered it that threw them off or if they just brought him the wrong meal. We did not bother even mentioning it though, and he still really enjoyed his burger.  I definitely give their menu credit for being so creative (both with dishes and names of the dishes).

10838,1,1549238400000,"I've got to give credit where credit is due. The Flamingo may be the best value in Vegas for those on a budget, but able to spend more than you might at Circus or Trop. Understand that I'm NOT comparing this hotel to the Venetian, Bellagio or even MGM .  I'm comparing it to other mid-range casino resorts on the strip (Bally's , to some extent Aladdin, TI, Monte Carlo, Luxor). Flamingo's location cannot be beat.  If you get a room facing the strip, you'll enjoy floor to celling windows and a view of Ceasars in all it's glory.  Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.  Not particularly cheap materials (bedding, countertops) either.   The pool looks pretty incredible, though we were there in November, and the grounds are a nice departure from the urban feel of the strip.  By far the greatest feature of the rooms at Flamingo is the cheap (yes, CHEAP) roomservice.  Flamingo doesn't charge a service charge (usually about 20%) nor does it require a 25% gratuity.  Also, items are fairly priced, considering they're delivered to your room at any hour of the day.  I must have ordered the buffalo chicken wings (not kidding about 12 good sized, spicey wings in an order) for $7.95 (total cost $10 with tip) all three nights that we were in town. 

Casino isn't much to rave about- sort of small, slot heavy. Very little poker action.  No real stand out bars.  But since you're in the middle of the strip, you can walk (or stagger) a few paces in any direction and find yourself at a suitible gambling spot.",3

The thing is, the product isn't bad, not by any means. For the style of restaurant (take-out/fast food), the maki is good. The reason I can't give out a four or five star rating here is because of the price. At a mid-teir sushi place, a salmon roll is the same price as it is here, but, understandably comes fresher and with better presentation and higher quality ingredients. 

So again, the maki isn't bad. Its what you would expect from this type of place, but for the same price as dine-in, higher quality rolls.",2
10845,2,1551225600000,"Apparently this place is a Northern Mainland Chinese eatery, different from the typical Cantonese restaurants out there in that they mainly focus on having a lot of meat, and not much vegetables on their meat dishes and dumplings. The dumplings are made in restaurant patrons' eye view.  There are fifteen dumplings per order ranging from 5 dollars to 8 dollars.  The lamb dumplings were really delicious.  They have a lot of meat dishes spiced with cumin.  They have interesting soups and hot pot.  During this occasion, I tried the herbal chicken stew which was really good.  Also tried a tofu dumpling which was interesting. This is a great place to go when you have a group so that you can sample many dishes at one time.  

If you love trying new things and love Chinese food, then check this place out.

Note: The food took a long time to come out, we ordered about fourteen dishes, but the restaurant forgot to provide two dishes, a fish dish and a pork dish.  When asked if they were coming, they stated that there were no outstanding orders.  Perhaps this is really a 3.5, as they forgot orders.

Not a great experience. Upon arrival there were 6 people working the host(ess) podium and only 3 people in front of us. The people working seemed unorganized and confused. When a table finally was suggested it was in the bar. The restaurant was half empty and there was no one in the bar. We ended up taking the table in the bar because no effort was made by the host to seat us elsewhere in the restaurant after we said we didn't want to sit in the bar.  We ordered two sodas, I had the bruschetta and my partner the lasagne. The food was mediocre, but nothing new there. 

When the bill came we paid, the waiter came out and told us when he tried to run our card he got a message to call the bank. He didn't know what to do so gave us the card back and walked away from the table. OK then. 

I called the bank and they told me that there was no record of the restaurant even attempting to run a transaction on the card. She mentioned their payment processor was having an issue and cards had to be run by being entered manually. Since the staff didn't seem to have a clue, we paid via cash and left. 

We went to this restaurant to honor the memory of a dear friend we lost who liked to go there, and we had the meal we last had with her at the place. It will have to remain a nice memory, because we're not in a hurry to go back to this, or any other Olive Garden.

UPDATE (3/31): Chris with their guest relations department followed up apologizing for our bad experience, which we appreciate. We will give the restaurant another try and update our review after that experience. Follow-up by guest relations is a 5-STAR experience. Thank you Chris!

Update (4/22): So we revisited the restaurant last night and our experience was the polar opposite of our previous visit. The host was courteous and seated us at a great table. Our waiter (Chris if I recall right) was new. Only had been on the job for three days. He did a good job, he'll be excellent in a few days! The food was good and we left the place in a great mood. What a different experience this was. So glad we tried again. Thank you Chris with guest relations for your follow up, and thanks for a great meal to the staff! We'll be back!",2

The fish was soo fresh and it just melted in your mouth, you almost didn't even need the soysauce. 
The oysters and other appetizers we got were also amazing. I haven't had a dine in experience like this. Sushi hasn't been the same for me yet being back in Dallas after this vacation meal.

A lot would be the appropriate answer. $15.95 Mon-Thur Lunch and $24.95 Dinner. And basically a dollar more for every thing else.I've been going to Makino for years. Let me re-literate that YEARS. I used to go to the one on Decatur and Flamingo and even then my young taste buds quickly acquired a liking to the magnificent sushi.

Their lunch is such a steal. $15.95 really? C'mon man. You know that's a steal. 

First thing is first I always start off wetting my appetite by constructing the perfect udon temura shrimp bowl. Does anyone have a napkin I feel myself drooling.  I get on those little pre-constructed bowls of udon seaweed and a few other odds and ends and add some green onion red chilli powder always a must then 3-4 strands of delicious tempura shrimp. Lastly I pour in the broth either Tempura or the other one and believe me it's a taste sensation that your taste buds will have and will probably never recover from. 

On the right side is their large marathon long of sushi. It starts with nigiri and I always always get the tuna topped with looks like onion fried garlic and a bit of a citrus flavor. The ika or for youse who don't speak Japanese Squid. Always a good indicator of a sushi place. It should be crisp white and not too chewy. A giveaway that it has been sitting out too long. 

I make my way to the sushi rolls of which there are many. And i always go for the tempura dragon rolls they make. I can't say enough about there tempura shrimps it is absolutely delicious. At the end is there large vats of ginger wasabi lemon and house made spicy soy sauce for you to dip there sushi in. 

Now, on the left side is the hot items. I usually for go the fried rice and chow mein they are not exactly winning anyone over in my opinion. But they do have good seabass in a garlic butter sauce that is specatular. Soft not too fishy and warm. I always go for clams if they have. And i believe they got rid of it but they did have these large jumbo shrimp that was baked with cheese and split in the middle. I miss those. What else makes a good sushi place better? Dessert DUH! 

They have a chocolate fountain with assorted fruits for you to enjoy and other nice little one person treats like cheesecakes, creme brulee and little custard filled croissant looking things. 

After walking around the shopping mall and getting tired c'mon in and continue shopping waddling around. 

The service is always excellent and they are very attentive. Waitresses do not need to be called over just to pour your drink.  And everything is neat clean and typical Japanese decor.",2

I really like Greenhouse tavern, I'm a big fan of the pig's head.  So when I heard about Trentina, I wanted to try it.  As an Italian living here in the states, I view Italian restaurants here a bit differently.  I know places that truly respect the principles of Italian fare and Italy's own openmindeness to blend and explore within the parameters of ingredients that compliment each other.  Nothing is set in stone per say which is what makes Italian food such a wonderful experience.  That said, Sawyer's dishes woke up my palate in a way I have not experienced since being back in Italy last summer.  His use of certain ingredients, the quality and preparations of said ingredients create a beautiful harmony on the plate.  The meats and delicate tastings of cheese and his bread board are just lovely samplings of what is yet to come.  The dishes were clean, full of flavor, prepared exquisitly and just delicious.  I witness the bianco menu from a table next to us who were so kind and let us peek in (and even try a few) and it looked wonderful, a must do next time I go.  All in all, from the staff really staying true to his idea of this being an intimate family atmosphere to the beautiful dishes to Jonathon himself taking time to come to our table and even personalize his cookbook for my girls.

Here is what I like to do when it is freezing:

Look and the flyer online and construct my weekly shop based on what is cheap. Then email my order to them, have them pick everything out and deliver it.  This makes grocery shopping as effortless as ever and reduces the energy it takes to figure out what to make in a given week. Orders are usually 50 bucks with three heavy bags full of fresh produce, meat, and a few cheap pantry items.

BTB is not a huge place but the vibe is very welcoming. Menu can be a little difficult to see on the board but laminated menus are available too. I love the natural color used inside!

Their regular sweetness is 4 pumps so I tried 4 for my first visit and 2 for second. 4 pumps may feel a little too sweet so some as they use honey boba too. But the ""Latte"" I added gave it a good amount of saltiness and helped with the sweetness! Their ""Latte"" was very different from what I am typically used too. A lot more saltier than a lot of places I know. I like it though. I love salt! 2 pumps of sweetness almost felt like there was no sweetness, but the tea was still great.

In reality, I was super curious about this store and didn't want to simply go in, look around, and leave. I was impressed by my initial visit. They've made the inside nicer than I expected from the businesses I know were there before it (tanning salon, laundromat, worship center...?).

Their stock of groceries, beer/wine, snacks, and even some limited produce was decent. The prices seemed average, and I do like the idea of a little grocery store at that corner. I was trying to think of what would work well there, possibly a little restaurant of some sort but then Cafe Social is just across the way (with limited hours though so some dinner option would've worked well here I think).

The cashier/partial owner (?) was extra friendly and nice. He even said if they didn't have something we wanted, he could order it, and it would be in in a few days. He also said they're working on a liquor license to be able to sell spirits. With the other liquor store not far, this isn't a huge deal, but it is definitely a perk.

This is a must-eat place, but be sure to show up early if you want the best selection. I find that it comes in waves. On a Saturday or Sunday it is best to arrive either at open or around 11. When I lived in the city I came here almost every week for bread or a treat.",1
10921,2,1550102400000,"My new favorite place to go in Vegas!! Off the strip with a very chill vibe and a come-as-you-are dress code; this is my kind of place. We were lucky to score 6 seats at the bar on a Saturday night. The bartenders were totally cool- answering questions and explaining the drink ingredients, unlike the bar-snobs you sometimes find in places that make really great drinks. 

The fabulous CJ made the best cocktails we had all weekend- hands down! At CJ's recommendation, I started with a drink on their current winter menu called the Nevadan- bourbon, chartreuse, orange bitters- delightful! When I was ready for a second round, I said I like bourbon and amaro, and let him work his magic. OMG! He combined whiskey, two kinds of cynar, and perhaps one other ingredient to create my definition of what perfection tastes like in a glass. Apparently this one will be included on their next season's menu which means I definitely need to find a weekend to get back to Vegas. Or even better, am hoping CJ makes the trip to Phx for next month's Arizona Cocktail Week and decides to serve this at an event. A girl can dream, right? 

The rest of the soccer family agreed that this place was the winner. I could have stayed there all night long, but in our quest to keep the party moving, we took the bartenders suggestion (along with a gift from one bar to another) and headed to Atomic Liquor. This place is a must-go!!",2

10945,1,1549238400000,"The food here is definitely some of the best in the area. They have really creative names for all of the menu items, and a lot of those items are very interesting themselves. The atmosphere/environment isn't the most comfortable. It's dark and a little out-dated. But employees are helpful. Food is good. Prices aren't ridiculous. 

They're well known for their mac and cheese, so this time around I chose to try the jerk chicken macaroni. Our waiter quickly told me that he thought it was the best thing on the menu. All in all, I was pleased with my meal and with the amount I owed once I got my receipt. I'm really going to have to come here on Tuesday to experience bacon night. I hear it's a good time.",2

We'd tried to get in the morning before but there was an hour wait so we made reservations for the next morning of our stay. Caesars Palace has very few options for breakfast. I'm not sure why one of the other umpteen restaurants at Caesars doesn't host breakfast. We enjoyed Cafe Americano. Portions were much too large for us and while some might find that a plus, but it feels wasteful to us. Our waiter was attentive. The food delicious. My bf enjoyed the pancakes and I had the classic eggs Benedict. Would've been nice to have a piece of fruit on the plate. Coffee was good.",1

We happen to find this place conveniently located right across the street from our hotel, The Monte Carlo. We walked in, and the first thing I noticed was the cool artwork/murals on the brick walls. We sat down & ordered our food, which came out pretty quickly. The sushi dishes were pretty small portions, but it was still delicious. As we were eating, all of the sudden, the music turned up, and next thing we knew all the staff were running around dancing, getting up on the bar dancing to disco music!! It was awesome:) Such entertainment! I'd recommend this place, although it was a little pricey for the portions you get, it's still worth experiencing.",2

It looks like a crappy old convenience store. Upon entering, I was greeted by the owner. When he found out it was my first time there, he told the person making the food, to give me the ""sample tour."" The sample tour included 4 tiny sandwiches to sample, and a sample of their homemade meats. I went in for a salad and I came out with a giant Ruben, thanks to my sampling experience! There was also an assortment of side dishes and desserts. The owner and family could not have been more welcoming, generous and customer service oriented! My food was so so delicious! I will be back!",2

The decoration is beautiful and the ambiance is warm, except a bit loud.

I took the ""monsieur le maire drapeau"" which consisted of tortellinis stuffed with ricotta cheese in a rosé sauce topped with melted mozzarella. The meal itself was very good. Sauce was very tasteful.  You get all you can eat small salad bar and fresh bread.
The garlic butter was AMAZING. I was filled with pasta and i still ate some bread with it.

Service was ok. She took my bread plate when i wasn't done.

Overall delicious experience.",2
10996,3,1551139200000,"I asked a local where to hit up brunch in this hood and he directed me here. A little French bistro with a great menu filled with salads, sandwiches, egg and crepe options, this little place was packed on a Monday afternoon.

I went with the sandwich and soup combo for $12. The chicken club and a cup of creamy tomato (though as the waiter mentioned, the soup was not too creamy, just a hint). The sandwich was large with delicious crunchy bread and what tasted to be a homemade garlic aioli. I loved it. The chicken was sliced thinly so you could actually get your mouth around the sammy (we are clearly not in Jersey anymore). The soup was perfect with chunks of vegetables; I couldn't have asked for a better lunch. It was large but not too big where I felt like death after. 

Service was amicable if not a wee but unprofessional, food was more than agreeable. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the neighborhood and need a nice little lunch spot.",2

Every time I've been there, there have been at most 10 people hanging out having drinks.  I gave it another shot on a Saturday night at midnight, and there were still only 10-12 people there.  But I had some food that was pretty decent, and the bartender was pretty friendly and helpful with my drink selection.  If you don't mind an empty bar, or prefer it, you'll really like this bar.  There's plenty of comfortable couches and chairs, and all the food seems pretty decent.  Oh, and they serve the full menu until 1am, at least on the weekends.  Good late night find!",3

Then we had some sides for the table: supersize fancy tater tots, mac and cheese, Brussel sprouts to go with our steaks. Delish! The dessert was what I was looking forward to the most as I love choc + banana and they had a chocolate and peanut butter dessert with banana ice cream. heavenly!

The line moves verrrry slowly when I was there - only 1 gal at the register. But food came out quickly after we sat down, so maybe they move the line slowly on purpose. This is the only reason I gave 4 stars because the food was great. I had the corn and red pepper salad with salmon. HUGE fresh salad with a good sized portion of tasty salmon for just a few dollars. I also recommend you order a side of baguette because that baguette is amazing. It's served with butter and raspberry jam! Good value, cute environment, delicious food.",2

Guacamole and salsa choices are extensive and worth trying a variety of either, or both. Chicken tamale with green sauce was outstanding. Food tastes fresh and flavorful. Lots of tequilas and margaritas to choose from too. Fun, slightly funky atmosphere on either of the 2 levels or outside on the patio. Watch that steep climb to the second floor!",2

Sure, it has local ingredients and a hipster ambiance, but the food just didn't seem that great. 

I got the grilled chicken sandwich, my girlfriend got the crab cakes. The food just seemed, lacking. I still felt hungry after I left. Also this is one of the extremely few places in the valley that serves fried okra. Incredibly disappointing however, I felt like I was practically eating crumbs. All fry and no okra. Sigh.

Parking here is just, stupid. They have complimentary valet which, you essentially have to use if you want to park. I guess it comes with the territory of being downtown but it's just frustrating. 

Good luck having a conversation here too, it's incredibly noisy, and also incredibly dark. I felt like I couldn't even see my food. 

Man, after all the bashing of this place you're probably wondering how I gave it three stars. Well, the food *is* good, just not anything amazing. Go here with friends and expect to have a noisy time, you'll have fun.",3

11092,1,1551052800000,"During my lunch break today and other afternoons in the past few months, I took the subway from my work at Summerhill down to this location & it's worth the trip everytime. They make the best quality Bubble Tea   I've ever had. I always get the Taro flavor from them and they make it really well with fancy state of the art equipment. What makes them unique from all other Bubble Tea places, is that they give you the ability to customize your levels of ice & sugar, and other ingredients, which I love because I don't like a lot of ice in my drink. One day, I hope to get adventurous and try some of their other flavors too. I've also been to the Burnhamthorpe location in Mississauga and again I had no issues with my drink there either, which proves that their product quality is consistent no matter what location you go to. 

In terms of customer service however, I like this Toronto location better as the wait times are shorter than the Mississauga shop and it's less crowded. 

Pricewise, it's a little expensive but you do get what you pay for so I don't mind.

It would also be nice if they could later on introduce a snack menu like some of the other Bubble Tea places.",2

Hospitality is good. The custard is awesome.  I was told that it is available only on weekends. This is a family run restaurant and all are dedicated to quality.,2

I signed up for the Paint Perks program.  When I went in to buy paint, I forgot the color name and they were able to look it up on the computer to see what samples they had sold me previously.

11113,2,1550016000000,"10 Things you should know about dining at Joel Robuchon:

1) You will not be disappointed, except by the price which might make you cry.

2) They send a free limo to pick you up and drop you off at the restaurant from wherever you're staying.

3) Prepare yourself for at least a three hour meal. It's an experience afterall.

4) They will ask if you want champagne when you sit down. Each glass is $35-$45. Water is $10/bottle for Evian.

5) 16 Course Tasting Menu is $495/person without wine pairings - this is not listed on the website. Wine pairings go up to $999/person.

6) Bread Cart - AMAZING. There are dozens of types of breads. The cheese breads and the milk bread was my favorite. They carve your butter from a magnificent butter mountain.

7) What can I say about the food other than it was perfect. This is definitely a meal you will remember for the rest of your life. Every presentation, every flavor, every bite was absolute perfection. It was interesting and complex, unlike anything I've ever eaten before. You just have to try it. 

I recommend the Riz, a rice pilaf with sea urchin and lobster. It was my favorite course of the night.

Every main course dish also comes with Robuchon's famous whipped potatoes. SO CREAMY!

8) Mignardises is the sweets cart they offer at the end, full of chocolates and pastries. My favorites were the creme brulee and the cream puffs. 

9) They give you a little present (if you're a girl) before you leave of chocolate and a booklet on the dining experience.

10) If you're there for a special occasion, there is complementary cake (or gateau *pinky up*)

PS Don't forget to ask them for their finest glass of Keystone Light",2
11115,3,1550793600000,"Wingstop is a pretty good spot for wings close to UNLV. To me its kind of like a fast-food version of Buffalo Wild Wings. You order off a board and and they bring the food out to ya, doesn't have a full bar but features a couple beers on tap/bottles and has a strong sports bar feel to it. Not sure why but this location seems to have ton of employees working (really just standing around) so service is pretty quick.

You can pick from regular or boneless wings along with a couple different sauces/dry rubs. If wings aren't you're things they have some other stuff on the menu also, along with fried pickles, kinda random but worth checking out lol.

I can't say much on the regular wings, not a fan of bone, but the boneless ones aren't bad. I kinda noticed that the breading was a little thicker than bdubs but still good. The wings are served wet, plenty of sauce/rub and are pretty big. Flavor range on their sauces is pretty standard, hot, medium, teriyaki, bbq, garlic parm, nothing unique Unfortunately for what the place is, its not cheap, about $10-12 bucks for a 8 piece combo with their soggy-ass fries and a drink. Overpriced for what you get and they still charge you a buck for ranch, smh... After lunch they have a daily ""happy hour"" specials that change each day, but they are pretty meh...

Its not bad, but there are better places for wings. But hey.. they got that cool touchscreen soda fountain!",1
11119,2,1549756800000,"Service at its BEST!!!

From checkin to checkout this was truly a 5 star experience. My wife and I stayed here 3 days for my birthday and checked in around 9AM with Ethel. She was excellent and accommodated us well with it being our first time staying there. She offered us some room upgrades at discounted prices but since it was only two of us and just wanted to experience staying here at the most basic level we declined. Even with no upgrades the room was beyond basic. She gave us a room with an excellent view and on a higher floor. We were facing the wynn and encore and still had a small view of the strip. Not a fan of Donald Trump but I appreciate any businessman who takes care of a paying client. The room had everything we needed for our stay: huge bathroom with a tv in the mirror, a relaxing jetted tub, huge shower, comfortable bed, kitchenette with a stove & tea kettle, a keurig, and a sub zero fridge. The hotel has valet parking only and a running shuttle that takes you to the wynn hotel and caesars palace on the strip until midnight during the week, all included in the resort fee. The valet team had great customer service each time we had to park or retrieve our car from the phone rep to the valet driver, and each time I called from the room the car was already pulled around by the time we were outside. The hotel is described as an off strip hotel but a 2 min walk around the corner you are on the strip. We were a bit leery at staying here in the beginning since our 1st vegas hotel experience was the Venetian but Trump by far surpasses the Venetian. You feel like everyone is here to serve your needs. Each time I called for any service from room to housekeeping the rep immediately greeted me by name and gave a followup call to ensure the service was delivered. The Trump hotel is truly an experience and customer service is top priority. We have found our new Vegas hotel. Kudos to the Trump family.",2

I was there on Saturday and this is how it played out: Our attentive and friendly waiter immediately brought the super-soft, right-out-of-the-oven garlic buns. I ordered a Shock Top Belgian Ale and  the coconut shrimp with a baked potato and steamed veggies. My friends ordered Fettucini Alfredo with Meatballs, Steak Salad and a vegetarian pizza. I tried the Steak Salad and will definitely order that next time. Not that mine was bad. After all, the shrimp were more like prawns and there must have been 8-10 of them. The steamed veggies (varieties of string beans & carrots) were perfectly tender-crisp. It's just that the flavor on the steak was surprisingly, uh, vibrant. I don't know what they marinated it in, but it tasted like it might have had some kind of citrus in it. Yum.

We ordered two desserts - the cannoli which was properly crispy and the baked apple dumpling was cooked enough to soften, but not make the apple mushy. Yum yum.",2

When we FINALLY got to order (just chips and salsa, cuz the kitchen was closed!) we weren't sure if the order ever got put in by the bartender. When a confused guy came out of the kitchen with a plate of chips and salsa, I pounced on him, not sure if it was my order. It was, thank god.

11148,1,1550880000000,"I was overjoyed when Phoenix got an Air America station in 2004 with KXXT.  A little over a year later, the station was sold but AA soon after got a new home at 1480 KPHX.  Even as AA went by the wayside, progressive radio was strong enough to survive on its own and KPHX continued on as the place to hear the best left leaning talk programs - both national and homegrown.  It was during that incarnation between March 2006 and January 2009 that the station was top notch and a true pride of the Valley.  In 2009, the format changed to jazz/lounge music for a time but the progressive talk format eventually returned and still is there today.

But since its return, the station's been very generic.  They really don't have its own identity like it did before the lounge lizard invasion.  During its 2006-2009 run, there was a strong local presence along with the best of the national shows.  It was because of the local shows that really made the station what it was - by reporting on and featuring the local progressive scene, this enabled the Phoenix left to feel more like an actual community.  We were aware of different rallies, events, meet-and-greets, etc.

But 1480 KPHX Progressive Talk 2.0 is bare bones minimum.  It broadcasts the best of the national shows, but that's all.  With its revival, there's been no local programming or news,  It basically has felt like a national or ""internet station"" that just happens to be on the local dial.  And that's a true shame because as we saw with the prior incarnations there's such rich homegrown talents that the station could be including such as Mike Newcomb, Jeff Farias, The M & M Show - where are all those former shining stars and why can't they be part of the current version?

The need for this type of programming to be included became painfully clear when this last fall, the station made a shift to half-progressive talk/half-CBS Sports Radio shows.  Ten out of 24 hours of its weekday programming now consists of sports talk.  WHY?????  Yes, some longtime stars of the liberal talk industry have moved on to other things like Randi Rhodes and Ed Schultz but there's still enough great programs out there that could fill those slots and certainly at least one of these sports shows' timeslots could have been given to a local left talk show!  This is the #1 thing the station's been lacking and really has needed since the resurrection and I'm baffled that they chose to turn over hours to a completely different format altogether rather than bring back homegrown programming.  I only hope that the sports intrusion is a strategic financial move to allow the progressive talk to continue.  If this helps this the station survive, fine but I still really don't like it.

Nonetheless, the hours that remain devoted to prog-talk still shine as they have the best of the best including Stephanie Miller during morning drivetime and Thom Hartmann during afternoon rushhour.  

...And then there's the weekend programming...Ring of Fire is featured both Saturday and Sunday which has long been one of the best progressive shows out there plus they also run encore ""best of"" portions of Hartmann and Bill Press on Sunday.  But again - where is the fine local shows that could/should be broadcast during this time?  Something like The M & M Show from its previous run would be so incredibly welcomed.  But instead we have the very embarrassing and rather painful to listen to Breakthrough Thinking Broadcasting Network from 9am to 2pm (five hours!) on Saturdays, a mix of entertainment and sports reviews/talk which at least is homegrown but has the most annoying hosts on it.  The main reviewer (who sounds an awful lot like Mike Newcomb but isn't) is at least okay enough but the other hosts really add nothing and bring the show down.

I'm happy we still have a progressive station - the right is funded by such an insane billionaire cabal that the left desperately needs a forum for its voice especially in an age when most of the major media is owned by one of about five parent companies and people like The Koch Brothers are doing everything they can in their power to essentially buy our democracy.  Stephanie Miller and Thom Hartmann are the cream of the crop and I'm glad they both are given the coveted drivetime shifts.  But in its second incarnation, the station has been an identity-less bare bones offering which the recent switch to 40% sports talk hasn't helped.  The fix is such a simple one - bring back some good local talk shows (progressive, that is - NOT sports!) yet this seemingly obvious solution has thus far oddly eluded them.",2

I can say all three were delicious!",2
11164,2,1549324800000,"Zagat got it wrong.

I went over the holidays on a seemingly slow night (half the seating was full) excited to try the menu after the Zagat article mention.  The first disappointment came with the 'wine list', there was absolutely no selection. We passed and went with water.

We started with the charred brussels sprouts appetizer, this was the unflattering highlight of the night.  The flavors were good, the honey and balsamic played well together.  The downfall was that half the sprouts were just mere burnt leaves rather than full or halved meaty sprouts.  It left us wishing for much more at the $9 sticker price.

***approx 60 minute wait until dinner was served after the app***

Finally the mains. Spicy Chicken Wings and Waffles on one side, Brisket Mac and Cheese on the other.  Let's start with the biggest let down, the Spicy Chicken Wings and Waffles.  The wing sauce was actually quite delicious and the wings were slightly overdone but not bad.  Now for the abhorrent, the waffles were cold, hard, dry and rather tasteless.  I literally asked the waiter if they were supposed to be that way or maybe they were cooked the previous day?  He said no, they should have been served warm.  Maybe it was the 60 minute wait that did them in (hint, hint)!  C'mon Chaz, $22 for 4 wings and a hockey puck waffle?

The Brisket Mac and Cheese was warm and steaming, but once you broke through the few strands of brisket on top, there was no more meat to be found in the watery bowl of tasteless cheesy/soupy slop that remained underneath. And to top it off, we paid $24 buckeroos for that bowl of slop!

The waiter was courteous but never offered to fix any of our issues with the food, nor offered any $$$ remedy when it came time to pay the man.  We gladly passed on desert, paid the check and said ""See ya again, never!""

11168,2,1550793600000,"Returned on a week night after we had a great experience several weeks back.  Not sure if it was a bad night for the staff or a trend, but not thinking we'll go back anytime soon.  Food was lack-luster.  Service was horrible.  Everyone seemed ""bothered"" by us.  Asked for guacamole with our chips and it was a chore to get those.  They came about a minute before our food arrived-10 minutes after ordering because apparently only one person could make it!  Portions were small.  My partner ordered fajitas and was given 4 tiny tortillas with about a teaspoon of sour cream and guacamole for topping.  When he asked for more tortillas, he was told he would be charged for them.  When he commented on the lack of toppings to the hostess, she sent over the server again, who did nothing.  As we left, we talked to the guy behind the register as the server did not come back to get our check after leaving it (she was busy conversing with other staff).  We asked for a manager, but we were told there wasn't one.  The guy behind the register apologized, and then the server came over to talk to him as she suspected we were complaining.  The conversation went on between them in spanish so we just left.  We both felt the staff couldn't have cared less, and ignoring us by conversing in spanish amongst themselves was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Guess business is so good these days they don't care about ALL their customers.  For the money, go elswhere and at least get mediocre service.",2

The first bad experience I had was when I ordered chicken pad Thai at a spice level 10, and there was literally NO spice in it.  I'd been ordering takeout for a long time from there, so I assumed it was just an off night.  The second bad experience was very similar; there was no spice in the pad Thai, but also, the delivery was 15 minutes later than quoted.  My last order from there was also terrible.  Again, spiceless and cold.  Also, two of the items I ordered weren't delivered, so the driver had to return...with more cold food.

Even though its one of the older stadiums in the Cactus League, the City of Scottsdale, the Charros, and the Giants have done a great job of keeping it updated and providing an excellent gameday experience. Get there early if you want to park within a few blocks, otherwise be prepared to walk or catch one of the many pedicabs or golf carts offering rides to the stadium. Once you get in you'll realize that there is not a bad seat in the house, whether your right next to the field, up in the stands, or on the grass berm above the outfield. Food choices include ballpark favorites like hot dogs, chicken tenders, barbeques, and for the SF visitors, garlic fries. There are plenty of places to buy adult beverages and souvenirs.

And while I have tried many others in the area, none of them have managed to beat this one out. I SO BADLY WANT TO GIVE IT 5 STARS, but the experience of not being able to fill up your water bottle in any other way than a water fountain (ew no thank you, germ pool), it's sadly only a 4 Star to me. Especially considering the Tallmadge location has that awesome bottle refill machine! I will gladly edit my review if that ever changes, but for now it has to stay. 

On to what would have made it 5 stars: the VAST amount of equipment to choose from. This is by far the largest location I've been to (or at least the layout makes it seem so), and they have such a great selection of machines to work on! My husband and I go together, so being able to pick a group of machines next to each other is super important to us, and this amount of space and inventory makes it possible!

The changing rooms are clean, spacious, and give you all of the amenities you could hope for. The lobby is always clean and well taken care of, as well as the work out floor. They have TVs for you to watch, and an adapter to plug the aux for your phone in to listen if you would like to as well, which I think is a really nifty feature. 

MY FAVORITE PART OF PLANET FITNESS: the PHENOMENAL massage chairs. It takes a little getting used to, but I am addicted to the way I feel after I sit down for a session of those.

The decor is nice but mostly windows and a large square room with a long bar and lots of pictures mostly of local sports.  A couple of beers on tap, bottle beers, wines and drinks are available. 

A simple menu of pizza, salads, chicken wings and a couple of sandwiches. 

Had the coal-fired chicken wings which come out crisp with caramelized onions.   The onions were gooood but the wings were lacking flavor except for a little char flavor and a little salty tasting. The pizza was good with a burnt taste which gave it a subtle flavor of charcoal...not overly burnt.  The crust is thin as you would expect for a fired oven pizza.

Burritos are freaking huge so definitely worth the price. The salsa is so tasty. I actually avoid getting the burrito enchilada style so I can dowse it in salsa instead. I don't recommend the breakfast burritos because there's too much egg and potato and not enough meat. But the shredded beef burrito and carne asada Burrito are my favorites. The shredded beef is so moist and flavorful I can't get over it. Also, I'd skip the extra charge for beans and rice. Rice is just OK but the beans taste off. It always tastes like there's cinnamon or something in them. And I think 2 extra bucks is a little steep for something as unbelievable cheap like rice and beans.",2

11293,2,1550102400000,"Came to Brunchworks Cafe today with a voucher in hand for $20 worth of food and drinks with William T..  Upon arriving (around 1PM), there was a short wait between 20 to 25 minutes.  Luckily, the wait was shorter than anticipated and we were given the menu to browse while waiting.

The interior reminds you of a local diner that parents would take their kids to on a Sunday, or somewhere, where a group of girlfriends get together for breakfast à la Sex and the City.  There are big windows which allow for a lot of natural sunlight.   They also have an impressive display of desserts; cakes from La Rocca; pastries and other desesrts from Dufflet.  Fresh juices are also available and the choices are scribbled on to a chalkboard close to the many board games that are available (Battleship, Sorry and Operation just to name a few).

A while after, our orders were taken.  Water was dearly missed at our table but that was easily remedied when requested.

Espresso comes out of a Nespresso machine that takes discs and comes in levels of boldness ranging from 2-10.  Serious espresso drinkers may be slightly offended at the sight of a Nespresso machine - but I didn't mind.  I got a double espresso and it was just the right level of boldness at 7 for me.  My dining companion got a regular coffee (free refills) and it was a medium roast.

On the table you will find individual packets of Kraft Peanut Butter, Kraft Marmalade and Kraft Strawberry Jam.  Milk, cream, sugar, salt, pepper and ketchup are also at your disposal.

I opted for the soup of the day, which today, was a Chicken and Wild Rice Soup.  When it arrived I nearly fell off my chair because the portion size was more suitable for 2 than for 1.  The ""wild rice"" was lacking as was the chicken.  Orecchiette was used in place of rice.  The soup was nice and thick, and was chunky and filling served with olive oil drizzled crostinis. 

I ordered the Little Italy Omelet substituted with egg whites (+$1.95) with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and mozzarella cheese.  The dominant flavour came from the sundried tomatoes as mozzarella cheese is a rather mild cheese.  It came with a side of home fries and serving of fruit (grapes, pineapple, cantaloupe, honeydew melon and orange slice).  It also comes with your choice of: white, whole wheat or rye bread.  The bread comes toasted and buttered.   

My dining companion ordered the Huevos Bruncheros with eggs over easy.  A tortilla topped with sour cream, salsa, guacamole, refried beans and Chorizo - it was definitely a feast for the stomach, but also for the eyes.  This also came with a serving of fruit.  I did notice the eggs were slightly overcooked, but otherwise, a very savoury dish.  My word of advice is to mix everything together before you devour so that you get to taste all the flavours in every bite.  Delish!

Verdict:

Although there are fancier brunch joints in the city (think Leslieville or Trinity Bellwoods area), I do love myself a greasy spoon diner once in awhile.  I would recommend Brunchworks as the food is actually quite healthy and not greasy at all.  The atmosphere is very laid back; somewhere you can either go solo with a newspaper in hand; somewhere you can have a brunch with a bunch of gal pals; somewhere you can treat your family to; and yes it is even somewhere you can take your significant other to.

We asked for a manger several times from our waitress as well as other staff.  Our request was in a respectful demeanor and we didn't talk down to anyone.  The manager never came.  I also wrote a note through the website several weeks ago (this was the night Pearl Jam was in town) and they never responded.

I was coughing, sneezing and sputtering (in a good way). You get a good amount of shrimp, sweet fish cake, beef, and pork and beef balls. Usually at noodle places you get more noodles than meat and seafood. Here, it seems the amount of toppings is quite generous. 
The roti was served hot and crispy ($5.99 with curry). The prices aren't the cheapest in the area but the quality and taste make it worth it. 

Mamak just opened up. Check it out before February 10th and you get 10% dine in and 20% for takeout.",2

The ciabatta bread is just wonderful. Strong bread to hold quality ingredients. Plus I love the chocolate dipped strawberry that comes with your food order. So unique!

In terms of food, all the dimsum we tried tended to be on the saltier side, but the overall quality of food was good. Portions were on the smaller side - there were only 2 small pieces of sponge cake! Service is excellent (especially when you have so few tables) and the tea itself is also very nicely done.

Also, theres valet parking..which seemed great at first, but upon checking out there was a bit of a wait and confusion.

11439,3,1550016000000,"I decided to visit this restaurant based upon the lone review here on yelp.  Also, my uncle married a lady from Ethiopia, and I was curious about the cuisine.

We arrived around 10:00 on a Tuesday night, and the place was pretty much empty.  We were the lone non-Ethiopians in the joint.

The surroundings were nice, but relatively spartan.  Our server, who obviously saw that we were clueless, was very nice and offered suggestions on what to order.  We went with lamb tibs and a beef dish of some sort.

OK.  Things are going well so far.  I'm drinking my beer, life is good.

The beef entree arrives on a big, metal plate.  There's also a basket with five or six napkins in it.  The food is sitting on this big pancake-looking thing.  No silverware to be found.  WTF????  Where's my freaking fork???

The server, sensing our confusion, unrolled one of the napkins to reveal not a napkin, but another one of those pancake thingys.  Holy crap!   I get it, you rip off part of the napkin (which has a very strange texture, like a sponge), to scoop up the delicious morsels sitting on the pancake.

OK, that's funny.  I'm a fucking yokel from North Dakota.  TEE HEE HEE. 

You can stop laughing now.  Really.  I'm a rube, we get it.

OK...the food was delicious.  A bit spicy, but in a good way.  The lamb tibs were a bit charred and had lots o' gristle, but were very flavorful and had a nice sauce to accompany them.  Very nice.

Service was at a leisurely pace, and the server was very nice and attentive.  The tab was about $30, and I had three beers.  CHEAP AS HELL!

I asked the server what the bread was made of, she said sunflowers, but I didn't buy it.  I subsequently learned the bread is injera, which is made out of a grain called teff.  Who knew?  I ain't never seen none of them there teff farmers out here in NoDak, no sireee!!!!  Wheat?  Check.  Barley?  Check.  Flax?  Check.  Teff?  Um, Nope.

I'm looking forward to hitting an Ethiopian restaurant on my next trip to the big city (Mpls/St.Paul, Denver, etc...) and would return here on my next visit to LV.

Closed Circuit to Laura B:  You COULD have explained what the napkins were for.  Just sayin'.",2
11442,3,1550880000000,"I was very excited to have the opportunity to attend this show!  I've seen tons of musicals, but Porgy and Bess was not one of them.  I was familiar with many of the songs (for example, Summer Time, It Ain't Necessarily So) but was not that familiar with the plot.  I did know it was more operatic then most Broadway shows that are shown at the Benedum, but it is always excited to experience something new.

After grabbing my sippy cup of wine, we took our seats.  The seats were great!  We were left of center towards the back of the Orchestra.  This further confirms to me that there really aren't many bad seats at the Benedum.

For some reason, there was a delay in starting the show.  I usher at the Benedum, so I know it had something to do with the production company and not the theater.  Knowing the show was about two and a half hours long, I was itching for it to start on time.  However, once the 25 piece orchestra played the opening chords of the overture, I knew we would be in for a treat.  Most modern musicals have ditched the overture and entr'acte, so it was enjoyable to hear both as a part of this production.  

Once the curtain rose, we were greeted with a minimalist set and a slightly inclined stage.  It made me think of how many opera houses ""back in the day"" had an inclined stage because they did not have inclined seating.  Although the set was minimal, it was impactful.  This was achieved through creative staging and choreography.  Even the fights (which can end up being quite cheesy in stage shows) were done tastefully and made as believable as possible.

The numbers in this show drew you in either through catchy tunes or for the emotional attachment.  I found myself wanting to dance along with the picnickers in ""Oh, I Can't Sit Down"" and feeling the raw emotion of the characters in ""My Man's Gone Now"" and ""I Loves You Porgy.""  Some of my favorites were ""It Ain't Necessarily So"" ""Leaving for the Promised Land"" and ""Oh Doctor Jesus.""  However, they were all enjoyable and well executed.  Sometimes when things are done in an operatic style it can be difficult to understand a performer, especially when using a specific dialect.  That was not the case in this production.  Everything was sung and spoken clearly which made it easier for the audience to follow along with the plot.

The show had a great mix of solos and ensemble numbers, humor and sadness and it flowed very well from one song to the other. Overall, a very enjoyable experience and a great night out!  I highly recommend seeing this show during its run in Pittsburgh.",2
11449,2,1550620800000,This is a very casual eatery. Order up front and sit down at a table with a number. My husband got the gangnam burger which was pretty good. Whatever sauce they had on it was flavored well. I got the mushroom and onions which fell a little flat. Not too flavorful and overall pretty greasy. Our 15 month old did love her grilled cheese sandwich but I felt like that was pretty greasy and a little overly burnt. And there were a few flies hovering around and some mustiness to the air. I suppose for the type of place it is I shouldn't expect that much. The servers were friendly and everything did come out promptly.,2

11475,2,1549324800000,"My husband and I came here for dinner. He got the fish & chips, and I got the pit stop burger with American cheese and bacon (cheese and bacon additions were an extra fee). The waitress told me all burgers are cooked medium well and asked me if that was ok. I was fine with medium well but when I got he burger it was well done. That really wasn't a deal breaker for me, but if you're particular about your burger it might be a deal breaker for you. The fish and chips were good; the fish was nice and crunch. My husband asked for lemon and malt vinegar when he initially ordered, but it didn't come with the food (he didn't ask the waitress for it after the fact just to be fair to the wait staff). Fries weren't anything special. Some people said the fry seasoning was good but our fries weren't seasoned. Overall the food was just okay, but affordably priced. 

The wait staff was very attentive. We had multiple waitresses check on us. Some people in pervious reviews saw this a negative, but I don't see the issue.

My favorite is the filet mignon and their cauliflower potato mash. It has a red wine mushroom reduction sauce so it makes the filet even more flavorful.

Out of all these foods I thought the bland beans and rice were okay. Too much cheese on top of  the enchilada and very greasy. The shredded chicken inside it was dry and tasteless. The pork tamale was horrendous .It was very dried and hard. I could barely cut into it with a knife. It must have been frozen too because it taste like.  I don't think I ever had a tamale this bad in my life!! My son had the shredded beef burrito and it too looked very dried and there was some sort of juice kept running out of it as he was holding to bite it. I did't want to bother to taste his burrito from the look of how unappealing the juice keep dripping down on the plate.

My wife and I tried them out a few days ago, a good piece out in east Mesa.  It was a Friday evening about 6pm and I expected them to be very busy but they were almost empty.  They are located close to the local retirement community and mostly seniors were eating there.  It's clean and bright and service is attentive.  The staff regularly refreshed the food trays and someone was always sweeping the floor.  The food area was about half the size of Pacific Seafood and their sushi section was a lot smaller.
We went there especially for the sushi and were a bit disappointed at the variety.  The sashimi was fresh and basically salmon and tuna, tasted very good but a lot of the sides we enjoy were lacking.  The rolls were nice, 3 different types.  No nigiri, no kimchi, no various Japanese salad items were to be found.  I thought the hot and sour soup didn't have much flavor or heat like that of PSB. The steamed salmon didn't have much taste.  The best hot seafood dish there was wonderful tiny ""Snow Shrimp"".  The sesame balls were dry and practically empty and the soft ice cream was rather icy.
The lemon chicken was tart and dry.  I'm sorry to say I won't be back.  The food overall was rather mediocre.  At least it was several dollars less than my favorite PSB.

11643,3,1549152000000,"In town for work so being away from the ""action"" was fine.  Booked using Hotwire ($45 a night!) so I felt like I got what I paid for.  The exterior of the hotel and common areas are fine.  The room was a little worn: the carpet could use a good cleaning and a few updates would go a long way.  

Bathroom, bedding and kitchen were clean.  I would recommend asking for the third floor .  Overall the hotel was quiet and for the price I paid, perfectly fine.  

The hotel is well off The Strip and you can't walk too many places, but if you've got a car or don't mind a cab, the location is not an issue.  There are a few restaurants nearby and you are close to the mall and hospital.

The staff was courteous and helpful. I did not partake in the free breakfast however it looked like a decent spread.  If you don't like the selection, Denny's is next door. :)",2

Probably won't go back unless it is to-go.",2

11670,3,1548979200000,"O burger doesnt look like much. In fact before investigating further, i thought the sign just said ""burger"". What they lack for in appearances they make up for in taste and value. I have tried two burgers so far. The Montreal is my favourite. Smoked meat on a burger is just a wonderful invention and there smoked meat is good enough that bacon might be stepping down as king of burger toppings. I like this place. You get a messy but manageable burger. Buns are super fresh and soft which is perfect for burgers and the patties are super tender. A bad burger i find is way too thick and chewy and I feel like they got it just right. Its not the healthiest of options although they do have a veggie burger. All in all I would say its a safe bet to stop in for a damn good burger. I also would recommend the smoked burger. I am sorry there is no photo, I was hungry and it was tasty and now i need to go lay down.",1

first, the hair wash lady was very nice. 

lastly and the worst, the hair stylist said so you came in for trimming today right, I said ya, then i told the hair stylist how I EXACTLY expected my hair to be cut, then he said oh that hairstyle would suit you better, I said NO to his suggestion. and guess what, yep, he freaking cut my hair in the way he suggested and I said NOOOOOOO to! I'm near sighted so I only had the chance to put my glasses on after he's done cutting, I was just so mad (yet I didn't yell or anything). My hair was pretty long(which I purposely kept it that way), and he almost cut half of it off!!!!!!!!!!! Never will I walk into that salon again, and I'm telling my friends how unprofessional their only hair stylist, he just didn't listen to what I told him to do!!!

I can feed my family of four with just those two items (unless we really want to pig out). Pretty quick service. We've both eaten there and taken it to go. Nothing fancy if you are sitting down there but it does the trick if you are really hungry. We've also heated up the food as leftovers and it is still delicious.,3

1.  Smoking is NOT allowed
2.  You can ruin your own perfectly good dollar bill by customizing it with a permanent marker and using a large, heavy duty staple gun to affix it to the wall!  I do believe it somehow ends up being donated to charity but don't quote me.

They serve homemade tortillas just like my aunt makes which I love!

We started with the flaming sausages, which were quite tasty actually. Although flavorful, they were in fact just a little on the dry side, which is more noticeable as time passes so eat it quick. Good for 2 to share, $10. 

I had the roast chicken as per some other reviews here. It was tasty, with a nice BBQ flavor. Just a bit on the dry side. Complemented by some moist potatoes and delicious rice. With the sausage, it was very filling. $10. 

My dining partner had the brazilian steak, which was thin pieces of beef.  It also had a nice BBQ flavor but not much in the way of sauce. Still, if expecting grilled meat, this does the trick. 

All in all a tasty afternoon lunch, and for reasonable price. Would definitely come again, as you can't quite find these tastes elsewhere.",2
11736,2,1549238400000,"Walking up to Sage Bar, we were unsure if we had come to the correct restaurant.  It's definitely more ""bar"" than ""Vietnamese.""  

We double-checked the address on the Groupon (Rural & Chandler) and then dove into three entrees and an appetizer.  My brother in law saw the white servers and the non-Vietnamese atmosphere and adeptly ordered a burger.  I shared a pho bo and stir fry beef dish with rice.  Pho Bo was okay.  The broth was very sweet in the Southern Viet style.  Beef slices were neither plentiful or scarce.  I don't usually eat that many noodles, but I found the serving to be skimpy.  They used the pho cut of beef (eye of round) in the stir fry which was very strange.  It was served with a sweet soy sauce concoction and we asked for nuoc cham (fish dipping sauce) and we were given a viscous and strangely sweet sauce.  I've never seen a Vietnamese person serve such a thing.  Plus they added an extra charge on the bill for the sauce, wtf.

The tofu appetizer was overpriced and not worth it.  I'm gonna have to buy a $1.30 box of tofu from Lee Lee to erase that dish from my memory.

I'm not sure what atmosphere the owners are going for.  This place gives me a weird feeling in my tummy.  Flat screens everywhere for sports fans.  Seems like if you're a single guy who enjoys Americanized/fusion food and often dines alone then this is the place for you.  If you''re looking for a gastronomic experience you will be underwhelmed.

I won't be coming back to Sage for any Viet food.  If I ever return, I'll stick to the American foods on the menu.  Hopefully they won't charge me extra if I want some ketchup.",2

Here's my quick takeaway...

Gracious and kind host/waiter. The owner also stopped by the table on a number of occasions to ensure all was well at our table, and for some chit chat. Seems like a good guy despite whatever it is that some people have against him. 

It's apparent that their disputes are personal and from off premises, as there was nothing about this visit that would prohibit me from visiting again. In fact, I can't wait to!

Take a stroll through the deli / store, where you'll find some great items that you'll never find at a typical grocery store. I brought home some barberries to add to my next rice dish.

I think that shows how much they care about the customers. We were asked, ""How sweet would you like it?"" and we all said ""Normal??"" The best part is, that if you don't like it, they offer to remake it for you asap. Brew Tea was super busy, and yet, they wanted to make sure every customer is happy.

I ordered the normal sweet, large, boba milk tea. And it was amazing. I like to judge a new place based on their milk tea - if it's not good, then I don't trust it. Thanks Brew, I owe you one.",1

11826,1,1551312000000,"My wife and I stopped in on Thursday, to get my western boots stretched. There was nowhere obvious to go for help with stretching boots -- no service desk, just a checkout counter. We walked around for a few minutes but it was super busy and everyone we saw was helping customers. Finally, we stood in line at the checkout counter, as our only way to talk to someone and ask for help.

A nice, older woman helped us out when it was our turn at the counter. She told us that she'd grab someone to help with resizing. We followed her around the store, while she tried to get different guys to help out. The first man she asked just said exasperatedly that he was ""helping 5 people already"" and told her to find someone else. She did but he was also busy and didn't want to deal with us. He told her that he would help, so she could go back to the counter, but then he kept trying to pass us off to someone else.

Ultimately, we were passed around to 3 or 4 different men before someone took my boots. Even then, he didn't ask me any questions about how I needed my boots stretched: which boot was the tightest, how much stretching they needed, etc. Instead, he just grabbed the boots from me, ran into the back of the store, and then came back saying that they'd be done in 5 minutes. We were left waiting without any obvious way to talk to anyone again. Someone did bring my boots back out about 5 minutes later. As expected, they weren't noticeably different in any way, and no one waited to see if they needed more work. We were just left alone, apparently to fend for ourselves and to interrupt someone else if we needed more help.

I opted to skip it. It was obvious that no one wanted to help. I would have been satisfied had someone told us that he was busy but could help us in about 10 minutes. I would have happily waited for my turn, as long as someone was actually willing to help me and to take the time to see what I needed. Instead, I just got rudeness and exasperation. I won't be back.",2

We looked online at the menu before we went over to get an idea of what we would order. We ordered a Canadian Burger, a Meat & Potato burger, a poutine, mac & cheese and fried pickles. We spent about 50 dollars but wanted to try a bit of everything. First off the burgers were so disappointing. The Meat & potato burger was supposed to have  a crisp potato patty on it with gravy. Instead i got runny mashed potatoes mixed with gravy slopped on the burger. The Canadian burger should have had pea-meal bacon on it and from the description and photo online, several slices. When we received the burger it had one small slice and a glob of grainy mustard on it. This was quite sad since the actual meat of the burger and the bun are very tasty. The poutine we ordered was terrible. The fries were terribly burnt and the box was only half full. There was hardly any gravy on it. We threw most of it out in the trash. The mac & cheese was tasteless and was pretty much just warm cream poured over noodles. The fried pickles were very good. Over all, the meat of the burger and the bun were good, not great.

When the store first opened it was a little bit of a sad state because the arrangements of merchandise was poorly laid out. They have since changed the layouts a couple of times, but the most recent changes seems to work rather effectively.  

There is clear signage throughout the store and the selection of items are similar to most other Marshalls/Winners. Shopping here is an effortless experience with no chaos.

I love shopping at this location right after my Wednesday evening workout at the nearby GoodLife since it's not busy at all.  I have the ability to shop in peace and simply take my time to shop. On most occasions,  it feels like I have the whole store to myself.

Of all my visits to this location I probably waited in line perhaps twice and never more than 5 minutes.  I have shopped here during the lunch hour/early afternoon during the weekday, and there's usually shopping traffic, but never busy.

We had a reservation for a party of 8 and after being sat waited 45 minutes to order, then subsequently had to wait and wait and wait each time we asked for so much as a refill on water. Twice a porter came to refill waters and then walked off with several of the glasses still empty- never to return with more water! We asked for our checks in the middle of the meal because we could foresee it being a looooooong wait, and unfortunately we were right.
When the manager came over to ask how everything was, my friend mentioned that the service was really, really slow. He seemed surprised and eventually told us that it was because we needed separate checks. When we (nicely!) let him know that every aspect of the service had been slow, not just the check-getting portion, he mentioned the separate checks again and blamed our wait on an outdated computer system. When he came back 15 minutes later to find us still waiting he told us he had comped our bottomless mimosas due to the wait - which was nice of him! Only...none of us had had bottomless mimosas ($20), although 4 of the 8 had had single mimosas ($8). We all said thank goodness that we had ordered the singles, because I can't imagine how long we would have waited for a refill on the bottomless ones. 
I do understand that separate checks are not ideal (when I organize a group outing elsewhere in the future I will definitely remind everyone about bringing cash) but they can't treat separate checks like some sort of puzzling phenomenon that has never been encountered before. And the separate check situation just doesn't excuse the long waits and poor service in every other regard.",2

I came to the shop on a Sunday afternoon, wanting to check out some guns for purchase in the future (since I had such a good experience with my dog, lol, i know, ignore me) people there are so helpful and made me feel at home. 

I can't remember their names, but the guy at the counter gave a lot of good suggestions, he answered all my questions very patiently, and after I picked what I liked, he suggested that I try it out in the range.  The instructor I had in the range was also awesome, he taught me all the basics, and tried to make me laugh so I would relax. Even though I ended up not finishing all my shots (I was too chicken, the instructor did everything he could), I really enjoyed the whole experience. Also, since I didn't finish my whole course, at the check out, they also gave me a huge discount, which was totally not necessary! 

Before I went to this place, I was a afraid it might be a tourist trap. Although there were quite a few tourists there, there was a lot of locals there too just to shoot. And they definitely seem to get what type of customer you are, if you know what I mean.

11916,3,1550620800000,"AHHHHHH...a stadium full of true Giants fans outside of SF!!!  That's really all I need to say!  This stadium really felt like a mini mini version of AT&T park.  The fan vibe, people getting there at 11am when the gates open for a 1pm game, true baseball aficionados! 

In the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, that means post game drinking is half a mile away, the location of this place is perfect!  

It's a small stadium.  You can see the players entering and exiting, catch an autograph and photo if you are lucky, and can view them warming up on the practice field right next door, then they move to the main field to warm up.  I seriously have not had so much fun and player interaction at a game before!!  If you are a Giants fan, you must visit for Spring Training!!  

If you have lawn seats, as I did, get there early and stake a spot with a blanket.  Friday night was completely packed.  My Saturday there was also packed, but also hot, so I did get there early to sit under some tree shade.  The lawn is the place to be for people watching on a Saturday for sure.  True fans come out of Friday, I felt.  Saturday was more for frat parties and guys watching girls boobs.  If you are on the lawn too, the restrooms here only have three stalls for the ladies.  The funny thing is, usually the line to the men's room is much longer!!  Truthfully I would pick the lawn over seats anyway because there is no shade in those seats, and they cost even more!  

The lawn area is also close to all the food.  Here's the rundown: 

Gordon Beirsch Garlic Fries, can never go wrong there.  
Island noodles:  meh...I felt ridiculous being asian and buying ""island noodles"", it's like going to PF Chang's, and of course I was disappointed and thought their teriyaki drenched sweet stir fry noodles tasted like crap.  
In the main area where the food is, you can get a Hot Dog combo for $9 or $10 with a pickle and chips, but if you go to the lawn right next to the scoreboard, you can get the dog alone for $6.50.  
Margarita's:  $9...really tasty and refreshing in the hot Scottsdale sun!  I think they called it a....Margaria...margarita/sangria.  It was really good.  
Lemonade $5.  Pretty steep, but I bought it anyway, refreshing in the heat, not as good as AT&T Park's lemonade, but a tad cheaper.  
BBQ pulled pork and brisket sandwich.  Hefty portion of meat on white bread.  Pretty delish.  

Heads up, if you are on the lawn during batting practice, watch out for flying balls and the men who will run you over trying to catch them!   

In the stadium, you can donate your money to get a hall-of-famer's autographed memorabilia.  I got Gaylord Perry's.  Also, their souvenir stand proceeds benefit I think it was the Boys and Girls club.  I don't know how much of it, but thought it was pretty cool that if I am dropping dough, that it's all for a good cause.  

My only complaint is the price of the lawn seats...good gawd, I can get Angels tickets at the regular season cheaper than these, but that's the price you pay to see our beloved Giants.  

If you park right in front of the stadium, be prepared to pay, however my parking price went to a charity organization who was running the parking lot.  If you get there early, you can street park for free.  On the back side of the stadium, there is structure parking for free...I found that out afterwards.

I will definitely come back next year, but will plan my trip during the weekdays when it's less crowded.",2
11918,1,1549065600000,"I usually go to a different location, so this was my first time here, and last. First off when I walked in no one greeted me with a hello and so I checked in and took my 3 year old and 8 month old into the kids care center, there was at least 20 kids in there with 2 teachers, my daughter is 8 months she was the youngest there, as I walked out I asked the ladies at the front desk what was the amount limit of kids per teacher she said 12 I said OK, I went to work out for about an hour and a half and when I went in to pick my kids up there were about 7 kids, my daughter was in a baby swing SCREAMING and crying at the top of her lungs, not strapped in and another 2 year old pushing the swing at its hardest, as soon as I walked in I immediately heard my baby crying and the teacher was conversating with another parent, I picked up my baby and she stopped crying. My son at the time when I walked in was trying to unlock the gate and so he saw me instantly. I talked to a supervisor and he (Kevin) seemed careless.

11928,2,1550880000000,"With the wealth of breakfast and brunch offerings in the Pittsburgh area, it's great to go to one that isn't snubbing it's nose at the rest of the crowd. We were riding around, trying to find a place that didn't have a 4 day wait and would satisfy a monstrous appetite. And of all the brunch places in all the world, this one came walking into my life.

Here's the deal that can't be beat: an unlimited Breakfast buffet with smoked salmon, eggs Benedict, an omelet station, and a frozen mimosa for $15. That's right kids! Add to that the great selection of beers and cocktails and you may need to move in. I was so satiated that I didn't eat another meal the rest of the day.

The bonus was that there was great outdoor seating so we could participate in some obligatory people-watching.

Next time I am back in this great town, I will definitely be hitting this place up again. I just need to see where I can purchase one of those additional stomachs and an extra-stretchy pair of pajama jeans.",1

Good thing I skipped the bread too cuz the 6oz Waygu (A5 grade for roughly $165) with the trio potato purée was very filling. Moreover their Long Island Ice Tea tastes very good (though not very alcoholic) but their Rockin' Rye (? Orange drink) tastes superb and has a nice kick for a whiskey mix.  Also if you are into red wines the Hirsch Cuvee for Michael Mina Pinot Noi is a superb red wine to go with your selection of steak ($25).  Moreover the service was superb and very helpful when ordering.  I will definitely come back to this place again.",2
11955,1,1550448000000,"For all of us old enough to remember, this is the old Warehouse/Underground location. I was amazed at the transformation of this place. They gutted it, and now its beautiful. The decor is simple, a few taxidermied animals, some heavy rusted chains, wood and leather, but the over all effect is simple and beautiful. Its very spacious. The entrance opens to a small lounge, where they have a full bar. Their signature drinks are all bourbon based, which I cant say I tried..not a fan of it. Up a few stairs is a main dance/sitting area and to the right the ""cafeteria"". Its just a big open window, where you can order nibbles.
There is a dj up there, and a dj on the lower floor. Downstairs has a low ceiling and a central bar, surrounded with seating and a decent size dance floor. 
Reminds me of the old Embassy. 
So why the 3 stars? Well despite the buildings ambiance, I couldnt say there was a particular fun vibe about the place, like say the HiFi, Broken City etc... The music was decent, and the place was packed pretty early...but maybe it needs to figure out what works best and roll with that...Regardless, I think this place will rake in the cash...its run by HiFi, Una Pizza and Ox&Angela folks, all very succesful establishments so far...",2
11958,3,1551139200000,"I have been wanting to eat at this restaurant for quite sometime. My husband and I were in town for his birthday and ate here on January 23rd.  We arrived to a bustling restaurant and were seated at the bar. The bar is quite impressive. We ordered cocktails and as soon as they were poured, the hostess came to seat us. Another host came with a tray to take our drinks so we wouldn't have to carry them. Very nice touch. We headed to the ""treehouse"" and were seated. We had a wonderful view of the entire treehouse. The bar drinks were outstanding. Our waitress was attentive and polite. We ordered an appetizer which was good. I ordered the Sea Bass while my husband decided on the petit filet. As we were ordering, our waitress overheard us say we would share and offered to have both entrees split. We also ordered the lobster mash potatoes. When our entrees arrived, they both melted in our mouths. The filet was so tender and the sea bass was light and flaky. After enjoying our dinner, we ordered the butter cake we had heard was so magnificent. Indeed, it was one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten. We WILL be back in April and we will be bringing friends. This was a real dining experience. My only regret was not trying it sooner.",2
11959,2,1551225600000,"This was the one thing I was really looking forward to in Vegas so my expectations were very high.  Three of us went for dinner with reservations at 5:45pm. I was the only one in our party that knew who Bobby Flay was.  I consider myself a foodie but the others not so much. The dinner menu was somewhat limited but to be expected if the food is done well. All en tree's were $35-$48 with the sides about $8 each (yeah, entree' does not come with sides.) OK, paying for a big name but not super expensive a la Robuchon. I wanted to try several different tastes from the menu so I ordered 3 appetizers at about $15-$18 each.  The bbq duck on blue corn cake was fantastic in a really sweet bbq way, however it was more like a tapa in that it was tiny and not enough to share a taste with my companions.  All the appetizers were really, really tiny - tapas style.  The mushroom quesedilla was unremarkable and so salty, I had to send it back.  I love salt so for me to send back a salty dish, it has to be nearly inedible. I have no idea how this could have happened. My companions had the salmon and she felt underwhelmed with the dish. The other had the rough cut tuna nachos which was basically like Hawaiian poke' served with a side of chips...tasted this and nothing remarkable in any way.  The bread was fantastic and interesting. The sauces were good.  The staff was attentive and professional. I left hungry and annoyed that I payed so much for unimpressive food. I think my companions were a bit annoyed with me for forcing them to go to Mesa.  Apparently, some folks here have had a good experience so maybe my expectations were too high.  Given this, I highly recommend having lunch or brunch here first as the prices are more reasonable.",2
11967,1,1549843200000,"I liked it.  Right before Xmas my oldest sister and I were doing some late shopping at Home Goods and she suggested this place after hearing good things from her friends.  It was late when we got there but we were sat w/o a problem.  We even checked to make sure it was okay bc some of the tables already had the chairs put up on them, but we were assured it was not a problem at all.

Our server was nice and good since we were his only table.  We each had a glass of wine and started with shumai and calamari at the servers suggestion.  Both were great.  The calamari was served with a sweet chilli sauce, but it was was to spicy for wimpy old me.  We then split 2 rolls, California and shrimp tempura I think.  Both were good and fresh, not the best ever but definitely would order again.  And finally I had been craving yaki soba so we got that with just vegetables and I liked it a lot.  Nice and fresh tatsting, not overpowered with sauce or too salty.  We also each had another glass of wine.

Overall, very good and reasonably priced split between the 2 of us.  If in the area I would return.",2
11967,2,1549152000000,"I do not think you can have GOOD, CHEAP tools, but you can have cheap tools at a good price, therefore it is a good cheap tool by default.

This store has somehow captured one of my obsessive compulsive habits.  Deals, Coupons, and somehow luring me in for things that I may need just once, maybe.  

What I like about this place is that you can always find good values here.....sure its made in China, but hey, if I use it just ONCE, then it has served its purpose. I am not sure that I would buy a generator here, or anything that my life may depend on, but for a one time job, or for those who need a few tools to get started to earn money to buy real tools, then this is the place.

I have found that this place can be addictive, search for the sales, be patient, then use that almighty 20% off coupon in the paper and automotive magazines, and it keeps bringing you back.

I have found myself stopping by here twice a day sometimes....( I may need to seek professional help for that), but believe me, this place is worth the visit.

-100% the cucumber margarita! Best margarita I've had hands down, and I'm normally a frozen margarita kinda girl. I was shocked by the price actually being lower than I expected for the quality of the drink. 

-The service is excellent. No matter how busy they are, we always have a great experience with their employees. They are super informative and patient with questions. Good job hiring manager! 

-atmosphere is fun and young, but anyone  of any age can eat there and have an enjoyable time! 

The only thing I would say that takes away a star is that the menu isn't very big. There are very few main course options and I wish there were a few more entrees to choose from.

We did the 5 and 6 course tasting menu and bought a $50 decent bottle of sparkling wine. Total bill $577.

Bread cart, bacon mustard seed bread, yes. Saffron brioche, yes! Cheese brioche, yes! We pretty much asked for one of everything,  and our waitress was totally willing to comply and made us a basket for the table. The butter comes off this huge block of butter and it's amazing.

Amuse bouche, split pea gaspacho (french word forgotten) with smoked duck, pistachios and mint marshmallows.  Delicious.

Cold appetizer,  artichoke with fois gras. The perfection of the textures of these two foods together is something to write home about. Because it was textural bliss.

Hot appetizer,  asparagus soup with fresh ricotta tortelini. The tortelini were melt in your mouth, fantastic. 

Main course, beef cheeks. So good. Best part? The whipped potatoes. Literally 4/5 butter 1/5 potato but somehow that just made them better, allowed me to feel like I was eating the butter from the bread cart guilt free.

Dessert, chartreuse sorbet palette cleansing and refreshing. 

The dessert cart! Yes! Tiramisu,  so perfectly arranged and delicuous. Again, pretty much asked for one of everything. My favorites?  White chocolate filled with blueberry, Red velvet baby cupcakes and ladybug chocolates (they were so cute)

I had the simple start (eggs, bacon, fruit, & english muffin) and I asked for extra fruit instead of the muffin. If they gave me double fruit, the original size must be tiny.

Finally were able to order and the food was pretty good. Our server checked on us right after we got our food and then never again. We had to walk to the bar again to ask for boxes and our bill. Both of our water glasses had been empty half the meal. 

I'm not sure what was going on, but I'm hesitant to go back after this experience. We tipped 15% which was not even remotely close to being deserved, but as I mentioned I've worked in the industry and don't believe in stiffing people. Normally I would never tip below 20%+.

The menu had a ton of variety with dishes grouped by cost. A very unique idea. Full range of offerings and we took advantage of half price prosecco. 

The food was very good and served family style, the place is meant for sharing so you need to keep this in mind when ordering. My partner and I ordered the Caprese salad, it was outstanding. For us gluten and no grain folks the menu can be a challenge, be sure to tell your server what your dietary needs are. 

My one and only complaint was service. I found it started off great then the server went awol for about 30 minutes right when we were ready to order causing a little frustration. It would also be nice if a manager would stop by for larger groups to check in. 

Overall though the place is vibrant, food is fresh and really wonderful for an evening out. I look forward to trying Cibo again for a more intimate dinner.",2

as you walk in youll notice many supplements, vitamins and the like.  move ahead and you can sift through aisles containing many canned and packaged goods that are either organic or veer towards that quality.  youll be able to find more choices of more healthy options for classic canned goods such as soups, macaroni and cheese, etc.  in addition there are also choices from different cultures, mostly meditteranean and asian as is usual with health stores.

their fruit section is organic and pretty paltry, so if you need a lot of choice in that regard you should go to a bigger store or one that has a better produce section.

should you begin to change over all you gross toxic cleaning products that you dont have to use gloves and masks if you just want to clean the floor, lets say, you can pick from a wall of cleaning products as well.

12199,1,1550016000000,"Couple of wrong things about this facility:
First: They ONLY have ONE VETTECH working here! ONCE A WEEK! That is insane!!! The other nurses are vet assistants, i.e they did not have to go to school nor get a license to work here. YIKES!! The good thing is that the doctor gives vaccines to the patients in front of the client, but when a client is not around I wonder who does the work???
Second: For anyone who will be taking their dog here for a dental cleaning--BEWARE--the doctor does not always do the dental cleanings himself! He has his VETTECH perform dental cleanings!! I'm pretty sure that is illegal in the state of Nevada. People who are paying to get their dogs/cats a dental cleaning are paying FOR THE DOCTOR to do the work, NOT THE VETTECH. 
How do I know this stuff? Some stuff I now from personally going in the office, other stuff I know from a source that works there. I am writing this review because I believe people should be aware of what kind of place this is. A VETTECH should not be doing dental cleanings, the doctor should be cited for operating his facility in this manner.

The antipastos we shared were bountiful. The wine service was timely. Everyone's meals were reported to be delicious. I must admit that I didn't get a chance to try anyone else's dishes other than a slice of thin and tasty pizza, but my Commendatore pasta featuring sausage, smoked provolone, spinach, pistachio, and cream was so good that I found myself getting a little protective when I could feel other people's eyes on it. 

With such delightfully executed food and service at such reasonable prices, M&B is the perfect example of how curiosity might get you into the door at least once elsewhere, but that only a great experience like this will have you coming back time and again.

 It's good that Brian stands behind his product and will come out to fix it...... eventually. 

Last year I hired him to replace stair railing in my home. The contract stated 4 to 7 days. The job took over 6 weeks. This was largely due to the fact that he would stop in now and then work an hour or two then go to another job, thus dragging mine out way longer. Fortunately I had yet to move in my house I purchased but Brian demanded the A.C. left on low 70s so that he could work in comfort. I asked him could he please turn the A.C. off when he left since sometimes he wouldn't come back for 4 plus days and he said no, I like it to be cool in the house when I walk in and I don't want to wait for it to kick on and have to cool the house down. I thought this was terrible since I knew he was only staying there most days for an hour or two and at the end of the month I had a $400 utility bill  even though I didn't even live in the house just from keeping the air conditioner running for him to stay in comfort.  Not cool.
Next was the trash that was left around the house constantly there was candy bar wrappers potato-chip chip bags fast food bags  left scattered around. 
His price was $200 cheaper then Titan stairs and offered a couple designs beyond what they could provide. The finished product looks good but it was irritating to go over and see my new house that I just purchase littered with trash and paying to cool a home for whenever he decided to show up.

12259,2,1550880000000,"They will give you proper value for your car if you want to sell it to them, or you can use their quote as leverage for other places.
The process that occurred from the time of claim to gap insurance payment went really well and the finance department does a lot to make it easier on you.
The no haggle thing is stress free but it's not for everyone. It depends on what you want I guess.

I would say that the finance rate posted on the windows of their cars seems disproportionately high, and researched I shopped around and checked to be sure. My friend got 4 percent lower APR with Carvana.

My negative experience:
Vehicle caught fire right after electrical service and they don't honor what they tell you.

The representatives you talk with seem like good people and genuinely concerned with your issue... but the supervisors sound condescending and unhelpful.

The service department sends your car all over the place, or so they did with mine anyway. 

A while back I had a vehicle in their shop for 30 days, and 2 days after getting it back, it freaking CAUGHT ON FIRE WHILE DRIVING. The fire department was called and in putting it out, the car was deemed a total loss by my insurance company. 

I was told by the service dept. that I would get a service refund since i had the car only two days before it caught on fire. They were very apologetic. They said they would mail it. I never got it. 
The fire was an electrical fire and originated in an area that was DIRECTLY worked on by Carmax and friends. My insurance did not go after them because they transferred my car to two other shops and figured it would cost more in court costs than would be worth it. The claim adjuster stated that the three service shops would just point the finger at each other until the case dragged out past the point of value.

There was miscommunication on the final payment after the gap insurance company covered what they did. It's partly my fault as I wasn't aware that the payment schedule would go back to normal after the gap process. I thought the normal payment schedule was over and I could work with them on what's left. Regardless, they didn't care either way. Details:

I was told by a representative,after asking, that the final loan total that gap didn't cover can be split in half and allowed over two months. There was no talk of my payment being considered negative, and considering that they worked with me so much during the gap claim with extensions and whatnot, I didn't think it would be an issue, especially since they had honored what they had told me at every other instance except for the service refund.

This ended up biting me as I received a call on the 31st day (after Oct. due date) stating that my payment was late. I explained the agreement, with confidence, and was transferred to the supervisor.
The supervisor didn't care about my agreement made and said it was late and I needed to pay the remaining monthly payment. I set up the rest of the payment that would cover my usual car payment to be scheduled that very minute. I was told that despite it being 1 day over the 30 day grace (for negative reporting) it shouldn't be reported late and will be posted that day. Him and I then verified the final payment of loan and the date it was due. 

THE NEXT CALL WAS THE MOST CRAP SERVICE EVER:
I checked credit report and there it was, a negative mark anyway. I called and explained my last call and was transferred to another apathetic supervisor. She said she would listen to my last call. She called me back saying they did nothing wrong despite all that I was told and that my payments and dates previously discussed were pertaining to the final payment to be made instead of the partial payment that would have finished my last payment. I told her she misinterpreted the call as we discussed both of those things at that time. Instead of seeing a miscommunication, which is what it clearly was, she didn't care and basically was being a smart ass. I was infuriated. I told her I wouldn't had even set up the final partial payment that day if I knew it would go on the report as negative anyway. I would have just paid it all and not bothered asking to have it split. She said that maybe next time, I only ask ONE question and not TWO questions (as in questions about two different payments) next time I talk to someone so that everyone can have clarity. WHAT! I'm only allowed to ask one question? I gave my permission for the final payment to set up. She then asked if I had other questions, but why bother if I'm only allowed one?!?!

Update: 8-26-17 In hindsight, I shouldn't have had to pay any extra after the car caught fire and should have sued for a list of things I could have sued for. I am wiser now. If shopping for a car again, this place may be an option if the right deal is there. I would likely not use their finance company, and would document every communication extensively. I doubt I'd be unlucky enough to have another car catch fire.",2
12262,1,1549497600000,"It may seem pointless to review a restaurant as ubiquitous as Panera, but I'll weigh in since I've been using a local PBC as a hangout to enjoy plentiful coffee and wifi during some recent vacation time.

Panera has executed a winning formula and they've found the magic spot, IMO. They've got the two things that make an attractive hangout to me: DIY coffee refills and easy/reliable wifi. These two basics combine to make a nearly irresistible draw for me, and judging from the other regulars I see there, I'm not alone in feeling this way. Add to this their creative, diverse and evolving menu, and you've got a pretty reliable attraction.

I've always been the guy to resist carrying punch cards and participating in shopping memberships, but I confess that I now have a Panera mini-scan card on my key ring? Why? I use Panera a lot while around my home town, and I use it frequently when I travel, so I finally decided it would be worth it to explore their bonus programs. I know these things are designed to provide simple behavioral conditioning, and to set up a feedback/reward system that will keep you coming back. And you know what? It works. I love earning free bagels, or breakfast pastries, or a free cup of coffee.

12332,1,1550016000000,"I'm kind of sad that the hotel only gets three stars, but their customer service is so rude!

Well first of all, the hotel itself wasn't too bad.  I stayed in the standard and the premium room, and for some reason, the standard room was slightly better (better tub, bigger room space, awesome hollywood style mirror, although they had an awkwardly raised toilet).  The only thing better about the premium room was the mini fridge which we kept stocked with drinks from the AM/PM across the street (hey, it's HOT here in July!) and the unraised toilet (yes it bothered me that much).  But the beds here are amazing!  I didn't want to get up most of the time...  But like other yelpers said, they have some major drainage issues (took at least 5 minutes after my shower for all the water to drain).

But now the reason why this hotel sucks.  They overbooked and wanted me to go to a hotel down the street the first night... uh, no.  So we stayed and got $20 credited (except no one told us that it was a food credit for use in the hotel only, until we asked about it on our day of checkout and two managers later, they told us that it was a food credit).  Kind of sucks because we ate at Benihana's, Superbook Deli, and Fortuna and didn't know to charge it to our room for the stupid credit.

I also had issues with their food and service manger Karen.  Basically my boyfriend and I like late night snacks, so we kept going to the Superbook Deli.  They're supposed to serve a ""special menu"" after 1am, and the normal menu until then, yet when we came at 12:50am, 12:40am, and 12:25am on different nights and they said they can only serve us the special menu.  Fed up after the THIRD NIGHT in a row, we called the manager (Karen), who had us on hold for ten minutes before answering only to rudely say ""oh, they're not supposed to serve you at all until 1am so just be glad you got any food.""  Uhh, the place is freaking open 24 hours and yet that special time between 12am-1am isn't part of 24 hours?  I'm not stupid, so don't treat me like I am.  Kind of disappointing, because the food was really good and pretty cheap.

So all in all, a great place to stay if you manage to not talk to anyone who works there.",2

12360,1,1549497600000,"Got a great deal with their 600 square feet studio suite on Vegas.com for $69 for two nights (although it was a mid week booking). The room was huge for a single occupant. Came with a kitchen, fridge, electric stove, a jacuzzi tub, a huge walk in shower with the rain style shower head and a separate removable shower head to boot. A living room area was also in the suite, big comfy bed, and two large lcd screen tv's. There was also one mini tv in the bathroom. Oak flooring, cabinets, and modern style furniture. I got a view of the strip facing side of the building. The few let downs: balcony access was locked, and the jacuzzi tub part didn't work for the tub for some weird reason on day 1. On day 2 it suddenly came on when I tried it again.  The room was comfortable and big enough to let 4 people sleep there if you had that many in your room. Room cleaning was decent but a few minor details were missed...one trash can still had trash in it and the rug portion of the living room looked like it was vacuumed sort of half assed as lint was still on it. I still loved staying here overall...Palms Place is separated from the casino so it's a lot more quiet and peaceful.  This room could easily be a party spot as well with friends if you wanted to entertain. This may be my go to spot from now on in Vegas. Best deals seem to be on non weekend days...small price to pay but you get strip and hotel to yourself pretty much.",2

In regard to my beverage, the woman behind the counter had little knowledge about the drink besides that it was strong (had a shot of espresso in it, in addition to lavender simple syrup, orange juice, sparkling water and candied orange peel). As you can tell by the ingredients, I was perplexed as to how this would taste. Surprisingly, it was not too sweet and had a strong coffee taste with a hint of orange. I did not taste lavender, but maybe my taste sense was off today?! Anyway- I do recommend trying this at least once...not sure how long it will be around as it's on the summer drink menu.

The salad did not have the best visual appearance but was quite delicious. I loved the passion fruit vinaigrette and how the different ingredients melded together. Thin strips of mango and jicama, pineapple and crispy prosciutto...made for a delicious salad. 

You can never go wrong though with a croissant sandwich or their soups. And as others have noted, the salted caramel brownie is the absolute best dessert here. Do not leave without one in your hand!",2

My beef kabob on top had to be cut into tiny pieces to make it chewable and the whole thing was overpriced.  There were 8 of us and the dinners arrived in series so that some of us could wait and could  eat cold food, or we could eat while the others waited.

12401,3,1549324800000,"My family and I were at Westgate looking for a place to watch SB when we discovered Hells Half Acre which was hosting the big game. The bar was completely packed, people were shoulder to shoulder with no room to move around; I'm sure completely violating fire code.  I was a little apprehensive about staying, but had already paid the money and didn't want to miss the game.  Within minutes of being inside, I had a server tell me I couldn't stand there; near the bar.  There were so many patrons inside, I had nowhere to move.  I attempted to slowly inch my way away from the bar, but within minutes heard a waitress ask me to move.  As I attempted to take a few steps back, I stepped on someones foot and as I was apologizing to the gentleman for stepping on him, the waitress shoved me with the rear end and knocked me into the man next to me, causing me to spill some of his drink. I looked over to her in shock, to find her screaming,""I'll drop these fucking drinks and f*** you up b****!""  I thought to myself,""Who was she talking to?"" before I realized she was screaming at me!    I looked at few of the people around me but no one knew why she was reacting in this manner.  Within 5 min, she heads back with 3 bouncers, pointing at me saying,""It was that one and her group!""  The bouncer came up to me saying,""You need to go. Come with me."" I asked what was going on. He replied,""You need to leave!""  
I asked for an explanation but all he would say was,""You are mistreating our staff so you need to go!""  I tried explaining there was a terrible misunderstanding and that they must have the wrong person.  He repeatedly replied,""That doesn't matter! If they points you out, you need to go!"" 
At this point my daughter tried to explain we just got here and they must have the wrong people.  One of the bouncers told her to put her drink down and leave.  She again questioned where this was coming from, when the bouncer knocked the drink out of her hand while shouting in her face,""Shut the f*** up! You need to go!""  At this point she yelled back at him telling him to listen to what we were trying to tell them.  The bouncer (a redhead with a red beard) grabbed my daughter who is 5'1, turned her around in a chokehold and pushed her out the door while screaming,""I said Shut the fuck up and get out!""  I was in disbelief of what was happening.  I can maybe understand if we were belligerent, or starting problems but we were literally inside for less than 10 min from start to finish. 
Just incase you're wondering if I/we were intoxicated and acting out, the answer is no.  We flew down from WA for the festivities and visit with family.  I'm a nurse in my 40s who doesn't drink, and my family are professionals who didn't even have an opportunity to have their first drink before we got kicked out.  The way we were mistreated and how everything was handled was absolutely unacceptable and humiliating.  Ridiculous. Don't waste your money here. It makes me sick to even give 1 star, I'd give a negative number if it allowed me to!

I can tell you that we are anticipating our next trip to Vegas so we can try some other selections from their menu. We ordered two combo plates from their lunch specials menu. I had beef chop suey and wife had sweet & sour pork BOTH WERE VERY TASTY, especially the S&S Pork! The sauce was the best I've had in a long while. The chunks of pork were delicately coated and fried so that they had such an amazing crispy texture to every bite all lunch combos come with egg drop soup (TASTY) fried rice (just ok) and a large egg roll which is AWESOME! All for only $5.95. They have a very large lunch specials menu to chose from, ranging from $5.95 to $7.95. Very reasonable. The restaurant itself isn't very exciting from the outside, almost uninviting but DONT LET THIS KEEP YOU FROM TRYING IT. It is clean inside and staff were very pleasant. Next time we will order separate entrees, I have a feeling they give you not so special fried rice for the lunch combos so just order the steamed rice if you get a combo. BUT DO TRY THEM OUT.",3

A couple of them were decent and we got a few laughs but there were a couple of them that were awful, and I almost felt bad for them. If you don't have anything better to do you should check out this comedy place because it's worth seeing at least you can get free tickets on houseseats.com. You can also get tickets to Laugh Factory at houseseats.com and I think we're going to try that next. As for the food I tried the crab cake sandwich and I just took the bunn off and had the lettuce, tomato and crab cake alone which was pretty awesome.

12501,3,1551139200000,"What a beautiful place!  I could tell from the Yelp pix that Red Rock Canyon would be beautiful, and I was not disappointed by the real thing.

Located just on the edge of suburbia is a park of incredible natural beauty.  The rock formations and colors, the plants, the animals (if you're lucky enough to see any), are all stunning.

Start out at the visitor's center if you want to learn about the natural history of the area.  It's a small but nice place.  Just stay away from the penny-stamping machine.  It ate our money and didn't give us any souvenir pennies!  We learned from a staffer that there are no refunds.

There is a 13-mile loop on a very smooth road that will take you through the park and past several parking areas.  In each of these spots are hiking trails and/or picnic grounds.  It can get very busy here, and in several places we could not find a place to park, so we just kept driving.

Spring is a great time to come here, because it's not too hot and there are lots of desert plants in bloom.  Try to arrive on a weekday to avoid the crowds and enjoy this place to the fullest!",3

Some dishes I LOVE are the pan-fried noodles with seafood which has the perfect balance of crunchy and crispy textures on the outside and that chewy texture on the inside. Put a bit of Siracha and it's perfect. I also really like the Yuka Root with bbq meat and shrimp that you can put into a wrap. The Yuka root is a healthy alternative to the potato with a great texture. 

However, the pho is decent at best and there has been multiple times our pork shoulder has not been cooked all the way. Otherwise, this is also a great dish. I think a little more attention to detail can really bring this place to another level.",2

Are you saying your mechanic (we'll call him ""Den""), kept the cash that I gave him, or that he gave you the money and now you don't have it to refund?  No wonder you preferred cash. You saw a guy from another state, heard the story that I was leaving in the morning and saw $chah-ching!$.
Your words are just candy coated excuses.  Your scam was a detriment to my financial situation and I do not believe that this is all the mechanic's fault.  You promised me a refund for months. You said you were sending it, and 3 weeks later changed your mind saying your shop was broke.  Remember I have a 2 year statute of limitations, I still plan on taking legal action to make this right.  ""Apology"" not accepted.  You think I'm trying to hurt your family? What about my family? $240 isn't chump change to a dad with wife and kids.

Another update 1/3 - Look at all the sudden ""5 star"" ratings received in less than the last month.  Halarious, especially the one from ""Tim B."", giving himself 5 stars. Tim B., as noted in the owner profile, is the owner of this establishment. He is attempting to undermine my honest but low rating review and has the audacity to even use his real name/profile to give himself 5 stars, whilst pretending to be a customer.

She didn't take off the 5 bucks for mentioning yelp. The manager offered to use it towards our next visit and we said no thanks we would like it now. They processed a refund then charged us the correct amount but made it kind of an imposition to do so. Don't be mad the customer, train your chaser to provide the discount when it is presented.

They promptly came out to my home and performed the treatment exactly when they said they would.
I saw termite tunnels, called 3 exterminators for treatment plans and an estimate.
David with House Doctor was clearly the most knowledgeable.
The 2 other companies confirmed the tunnels we found were termites, one company did not find any other tunnels, the second company found one other area with tunnels area, David from House Doctor was the only one to find all areas in my home that had tunnels.
Their plan for treatment was much more extensive than the others and their estimate was within a few dollars of the lowest estimate and hundreds lower than the third company.
Bottom line they provided the highest level of expertise, the most through job, a 5 year guarantee all at the most competitive price.
The only thing negative i can say is that I had to wait a few weeks before they had time to treat my home but I guess when you do a great job for a fair price you are in demand.",1

12630,3,1550188800000,"Amazing AYCE sushi joint! Whenever my friends and I decide to get AYCE sushi, I lower my standards significantly. That's understandable right? because you can't serve unlimited high-quality fish at an affordable price - it just doesn't make sense economically. But FORTUNATELY at this joint, that rule doesn't apply! The sushi here is actually pretty damn good. Yes it isn't as great as what you'd get in an omakase or an izakaya, but for an AYCE, this was hands-down one of the best fish I have been served. Oh and for the very competitive price, you also get access to some super ""rare"" items such as salmon belly, ocean trout nigiri, uni, and more. For you sushi newbies, these items are considered commodities and usually will cost you quite the penny if bought alone. Go ask how much two pieces of salmon trout nigiri costs at another sushi restaurant! But here it's included in the AYCE! Though understandably these rare items are limited to 1 per person but there are so many to choose from, you'll feel like a fancy schmancy sushi connoisseur at the end of your meal.

Seriously if you're feeling like indulging or stuffing your face in Vegas, skip the $40 buffets on the strip and come here. You'll get much better food and leave much more satisfied. At least that's what we did. Hoorah",2

The first auto shop I took my 99 GMC Safari van to was honest in advising me that despite their many efforts, I should take it to a GM dealer.  I knew that wouldn't work because they cost about $110-$120/hr plus parts.

Praise God I made a few phone calls and found that not only was VI Auto reasonable with their rates ($80/hr) but that had two mechanics with GM certification.  I had the vehicle towed there.

I had three major issues that I was guessing would cost me a $1000 or more.  The ac needed to be fixed, I had an electrical issue and my hatch window was broken.  Not only did they fix all the repairs for a fraction of what I expected, but they did it so quickly!

I would be pleased to be a reference for them.  Being a single female, I felt Mark was honest and didn't try to take advantage of my lack of knowledge and need to get my vehicle fixed.

My fiancé and I got enchiladas (he the shrimp, me the chicken) and both were excellent.  We got the trio of pick your own salsa, guac and queso and unending chips.  The guac was a little heavy on the onions for me, but the queso and Barack bean and corn salsa were delicious.  We even got the chili brownie which was by far the best dessert I've had in a long time.  Our friends got the apple empanada which looked amazing too.  The margaritas were also on point.  We got the strawberry and house margaritas and both were so tasty we got multiple!  

The inside decor was really cool too.  Loved the lights.  The one downside was the shape of the plates weren't conducive to the small table we were in for 6 people.

They texted me the day before at 10 at night to tell me they would be late tomorrow, around 10 or 11. I disclosed to them that I had people at my new place I schedule to install stuff at 1 so I emphasized that I was on a time restraint. They didn't seem to care and basically told me ""well hopefully they get done by then."" The next morning at 11 still no one was there to help me move. I called and they told me it would be another hour. I was livid. They didn't show up till 1! Thank goodness I found someone to make it to my place for the installers, super inconvenient and unprofessional in my opinion. So they show up and start moving my things, but before they did they apologized which I did appreciate. The men were very kind and nice so I will say that about them. As for the handling of my things, I saw one man literally drop a large price of my furniture in front of me. I noticed that a lot of what they were doing was alone and with the larger pieces they were also moving ALONE. I will say many pieces of my furniture are scraped and chipped now. I've moved before and my furniture has never looks so bad until this moving company moved me. 

I've moved many times since I moved to the valley so I have some experience when it comes to movers and how long it usually takes to move my stuff. This moving company was the worst moving company I've ever worked with out of them all. The fact that they started at 1 and didn't get done till nearly 7 makes me even more mad. I moved from my old place that was on the second floor to a one story house in about 3 hours. These movers moved my things from a one story home where all the things were already ready and boxed to another one story home which took them an excessively longer time. I do not think they were using their time efficiently or wisely and in the end charged my family a joke of a fee. I would suggest using Pearson moving or Pointdexter movers.

Will definitely be back for the customer service, cleanliness, and delicious food! Might just dine in next time with the takeout wait time though ...",2

Pizza? What pizza? It doesn't look, smell or taste like pizza!!!

 ... but it's very good. I'd describe it as a Mediterranean puffy pie with your choice of ingredients. The standard offerings are of the kitchen sink variety but that's not my style. I ordered an individual with cheese, mushroom, onion and sausage and it was yummy. When the waitress brought it to the table I was like ""what the hell is that?""  I though it was a failed attempt at dip dish pizza, but as i ate into it I shed my preconceptions and enjoyed it for what it is. Very little tomato sauce BTW but that's a plus. I spoke a little with the owner when I paid, she's a real nice person, she even said ""tell me what dish you want and I'll make it for you"".",2

The blueberry was the crowd fav, best so far and we've had donuts from all over lately. They're lighter and not real greasy and taste fantastic. Favorite cereal was the fruity pebbles, perfect combo.

Lots of TVs yo watch your favorite sports, too.    Lastly the food can be enjoyed inside or on the spacious patio.

The waitress simply brushed off some food that was on the table onto the floor underneath the table, I believe she thought I wouldn't notice. After eating a plate of crab legs I got up from my table when I returned, my instrument used to crack the crab legs were taken away along with the bowl we were using to place the shells as if they were telling us we've had enough crab legs and don't need anymore because they were never returned. Plus none of the staff know English so it's very difficult to communicate. I tried to simply ask for a refill and for our waitress to take our plates. It was very awkward and annoying for such a simple request to end up so complicated. There was absolutely no customer service. I will never return because of my previous experience.",2

There's a lot going on the board and immediately you'll gravitate towards their signature dogs. Honestly, you're probably better off just creating your own hot dog. A lot of their signature dogs have A LOT going on, to the point where you're not sure what's going to standout. 
We all ended up with the el Mexicano and while it was delicious, the green sauce (literally called green sauce) really overpower the whole taste of the hot dog.

Cept for the fact that I usually leave with random dog hair attached to my tounge. They have a sort of Ben and Jerry's anti Petco mentatlity and I respect that. They have a great stock of toys, treats and other poochie gucci things. The grooming service is fantastic. Forty bucks for a 90 minute groom is quite a deal. Cut to me trying to bathe Emilie in my tub and the ensuing waterworks flooding my bathroom floor. Me cussing, spilling my martini. Emilie constantly violently shaking excess shampoo and water all over the walls. Not pretty. Also provided is a self washing area. Well, not self washing as in you wash yourself, cuz, well that would be weird. But an area where you yourself can wash your dog. They provide with an apron, brush, shampoos, etc. and constantly check on you. And I can never leave without purchasing their homemade doggie treats, kinda pricey at $10 for a bag, but their made right there in front of ya and I love supporting the smaller business.

We ordered the diver scallops which was very good. I didn't know that it would be wrapped in bacon, but that was a lovely surprise. Anything wrapped in bacon is in my good books. The prime rib was huge! (Might be wise to share) It was tasty, but not as tender as I would've preferred. The garlic mashed potatoes were flavorful and the asparagus (straddling on the too salty side) was cooked perfectly- not too soggy or crunchy. Food service was extremely fast for such an establishment. We were so impressed with how fast food was coming out. We were too full for dessert but there was a good array of options. The atmosphere was a little louder than I had expected but that was due to some loud neighbouring tables. We would definitely come back and recommend to others.",2

ABOUT THE FOOD: Ordered 3 take-out meals for 3 people: The entree choices are extensive, include your choice of soup, or greek salad, and for a side, rice (a bit bland) , fries (didn't try) , or roasted potatoes (GREAT + AWESOME. YUM) . The Greek Salads are huge, packed with delicious greek olives, feta, and all the veggies were super crisp and super fresh. One of the best side salads I've ever had. For the entrees, Gyro Plate, Lamb Soulvaki, and Moussaka, were ordered. My Moussaka was KICK ASS and completely put that swill from My Big Fat Greek to shame. The Lamb Soulvaki was juicy, and tender, and dad seemed to enjoy his giant plate of Gyro meat. All of these are served with fresh grilled pita wedges too, and rang in just below $10 each. SO MUCH FOOD, for the price. Finally the two staff members I encountered were SO NICE, helpful, cheerful, and very willing to accommodate customers.

The sushi is very authentic which is rare in an over-sushied city. Each roll is beyond delicious and made to perfection. This place is underrated. Grade A rolls at a low key location? Awesome!!

That's okay, because they were delicious. My husband got the ribs. They were a tab bit dry for our taste, but still great. The sangria is amazing,  nothing wrong with them and everything right.

I looked at several other hotels and after looking at reviews and pictures decided that the Palms Place was what I wanted. I check in and have a good experience getting to my room and being impressed at how much it actually resembled the photos online.  I get my coupon for two for one drinks and go down to the cozy bar and have my drinks. A short time later, a gentleman comes in and gets what appears to me to be an ashtray.  30 seconds after that, I am subjected to his smoking.  While I understand people smoke and typically smoke in bars...especially in Vegas...this is not OK. This is exactly what I wanted to avoid. 

I was speaking with one of the bartenders and she said I should go and speak witht the manager. When I went to speak with the evening manager, Christy, all she said her superiors have authorized her to offer is a spa treatment. Really? A spa treatment? 

I want everyone to understand, this is a nice hotel.  What it is not is a non smoking hotel.  If you are looking for a completely non smoking hotel, go some place else. 
Look, I get it...it's Vegas right?  I should expect smoking...especially in the bar. No. I should expect when I book a room at what is advertised as a non smoking hotel, I get a room in a non smoking hotel. NON SMOKING. Period.

12960,3,1549324800000,"I was actually looking for a family doctor in Toronto and went through Healthcare Connect, and they really should NOT have sent me to this factory-style clinic. This is *not* a family doctor. This is a Walk-in Clinic pure and simple. 
  Also, as I've seen in multiple reviews, the front desk staff and reception seem rather uninterested and unprofessional. This is supposed to be my new family doctor, and when I call for an appointment, they direct me to merely ""Walk In and wait whenever"". Family doctors are actually supposed to keep track of patients some what, and you're supposed to be able to make an appointments, right?  I had to tell the receptionist that I have a job, so no. I can't just walk in on a weekday and wait for an hour or two like a student. I prefer to have a fixed, proper appointment. 
  When it came to the doctor, well, she was ok.. She was kind of robotic, distracted and cold. I guess it's a very busy place and they get inundated with all walks of life so maybe social skills aren't a big priority. I can't blame them for being this way looking at the location though. I can't imagine what element they get right at Dundas. It's just I would like a family doctor that has a hint of a personality. My parents have doctors that remember who they are, are able to be pleasant, and able to keep track of their health. That's what I am looking for ( not a friend, a reasonably pleasant, competent doctor and a well run, professional office. I don't like feeling that I'm an inconvenience). 
  It just really comes across as nothing more than a quick Walk-In for Ryerson students or random injuries (could be decent for walk ins though). No one should take this place seriously for a long term family physician.  Needless to say, I'm going back to Healthcare Connect to ask for a more traditional family practice. I'm not going back.",3

The menu offers a lot of traditional Italian fare, as well as more adventurous options.  I had the steel pan pizza, and it was fantastic.  Fresh ingredients and excellent preparation made for a meal that should have left me with plenty of leftovers from the generous portions, but I ate the whole thing because I just couldn't resist.

12983,3,1549497600000,"This musical isn't going to win any Tony awards, but if you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies you'll enjoy it BUT only if you get the splatter zone. 

Like the movies the musical is packed full of campy humor and gore which is exactly why you love the movies. The song's lyrics are at most times over powered by the music, but I would have to say my favorite one was ""WTF.""

This reminded me of Community Theater with a few surprisingly good singers, terrible props and uncomfortable seats. I found it really funny that you could all ready see the tears and faded blood stains from past performances on their clothes from the very start. 

My group did the splatter zone and we LOVED it. They get you from all sides, but mostly it came from the back right. With the spaltter zone you get VIP seating, 2 for 1 bar drinks and a white Evil Dead t-shirt.

The odd thing about the ""blood"" was it was warm. I never did get use to that.

If you've seen all 3 movies, you will have fun. However, it does take a moment to get into. 

Here are a few things to think about:
-Don't go if you think this is going to be scary. It's not.
-Don't go if you are offended by swearing. They do it A LOT.
-Don't go if you hate campy movies with cult followings.
-Don't go if you never seen any of the Evil Dead movies.
-Don't go if you hate musicals.
-Don't go if you don't want to get ""pinkish water"" coloring on your clothes. It can get on you EVEN IF you aren't in the spatter zone. Mainly the first and second row behind the VIP area.
-Don't go because someone talked you into it. You won't like it. We saw a few couples/groups not come back after the second act because someone was whining they wanted to go.

DO GO-
-If you love the Evil Dead movies.
-If you have an open mind.
-If you are willing to ""gamble"" $40-$70 dollars on something you may not like.
-If you quoting the popular movie lines with the actors. The crowd was shouting these lines. It was a great vibe.

***The key is to expect the worst. That's what I did and I had fun.***",1

I had initially called them because my equipment was broken which they also took care of but added on their maintenance program after.  I get an email every week when the pool was cleaned that tells me when they were there.  It also has the chemical readings and what chemicals were added and a picture of the pool.

13012,1,1549411200000,"We went for the opening game yesterday and for the Girl Scout night.  First, there were only 2 bad parts to this ballgame. 1: I found that parking is not free, its $4.00 and the smallest bill they take is a 20 and you have to pay cash. 2: Traffic is ridiculous. You would think Metro woud have better crowd control.  We sat on the off ramp of the 95 to Las Vegas Blvd for 35 minutes just trying to turn right, so be prepared to remain calm and watch for people turning right from the lane next to you, pushing your car off the road or just trying to ram into your car.  The food prices seemed ok. Hotdog (Hebrew National I think) was really good, it was 4.00 but we had planned on going back up to get mustard on it after we dropped the drinks off at our seats, but it was so crowded we ate it plain.  The best soda deal was the souviener cup for 5 bucks. Peanuts were 4.00 and my daughter says they had the best grilled cheese (which I think was 4 or 5 bucks).  What I didn't know was that you can bring your own food into the park.  Also, there are lots of opportunities to catch a foul ball so be sure to bring your glove.  One guy was lucky to have bought popcorn cuz thats where one foul ball landed.  There was a great fireworks show at the end.  Overall, I would say it was pretty cool and fun for a good family night out.",2

13043,1,1550707200000,"I have gone to a couple of Shoeless Joe's before and they have always been great, good food and good service. This one however..... not great. I have been to this location twice, the first time was god awful and the second time we only went because it was close by and late, it ended up being okay that time (nothing spectacular, just decent). For this review I will be focusing on our first visit. 

We went here for a dinner because we received some coupons in the mail. When we arrived there were very few people in the place so we figured service would be quick. Wrong. They had 2 waitresses working and ours took an excessively long time to come take our drink order. In fact the manager noticed how irritated we looked that he had to come and take our drink order (he looked just as irritated as we did for us having to wait), he did offer us a free alcoholic beverage for the wait so that was nice. We also ordered our appetizer and dinner at this time.

After he left I am assuming he went and spoke to our waitress and she finally came over to make sure her manager took our order. We said yes and she left. We got our drinks shortly after but then, again, we waited an excessively long time for our food order to come. Finally after about 30 minutes our food showed up, which was brought out by the manager and not our waitress. 

The food was nothing special, I ordered a wrap and really didn't enjoy it very much but that wasn't what bothered me, I was completely irritated by the horrible service from our ""waitress"". I could see her waiting on everyone around us but not once came over to see if we needed refills or to check if our food was okay. She likely just assumed her manager was taking care of us even though it was clearly her job to do so and not her manager. Finally we had to stop her and ask her for a drink refill. She said she would get it but had an expression that looked as though she was confused as to why we asked her or as if she was too busy. 10 minutes later, no drink. My boyfriend ended up getting up to go to the bar and get me one. 

Finally when it came time to pay our bill, guess what? Again we waited to get this girls attention, Finally she came over and we told her we wanted to pay, she said she would go ask her manager to see what the plan was with our bill. She clearly knew we were pissed. She came back and said her manager said our entire dinner was free. We were happy with this as the service was completely unacceptable.

Basically if you want to go to a Shoeless Joe's I would avoid this one. The only good thing I have to say is that the manager was the only helpful person during this entire scenario so we appreciate that. The waitress however, AWFUL.",2

13044,3,1550102400000,"A lot of the the complaints I have read in some reviews are valid:  
-it is very busy most of the time
-it does have some limited equipment
-The child care area is very large, and the basketball court is very small... and some clients may have enjoyed more room for equipment 

On the topic of the cancelation fees and annual fees, they seem to be much more forth coming with this information at this point in time.  All of those things were explained to me clearly when I signed up, and I do not feel that I was being scammed or a bait and switch was being pulled on me.

Overall, I am pleased with the gym and I have no desire to cancel any time soon.  I'll hang in there for a while.  It is conveniently located and if you can get in on off hours its not  too crowded.  Come in, check it out, and see if you think its a good fit for you.",1

13047,1,1550448000000,"Toyota financial services is the most dishonest and ruthless company I have ever dealt with. 
My 3 yr lease ended, and I was sent an outrageous $1500 bill for excessive wear and use. 
There are two small dents or gouges near the sidewall of the front two tires, equalling to almost 1 inch. The Toyota Financial services excessive wear policy and guidelines clearly state that ANYTHING AMOUNTING TO 1 INCH OR LESS IS ACCEPTABLE.
They are charging me $400 for windshield replacement when the insurance company is deemed responsible for the chip-and lastly, they are charging me for the floormats WHEN I NEVER RECEIVED ANY TO BEGIN WITH. 
Toyota financial services are crooks. This is an unacceptable way to conduct business. This company does not care to cooperate with me or the dealership even. This company only cares to gouge honest people for all their money. They refuse to release to me the inspection report and alleged photos of damage.

13053,1,1549584000000,"Rocky River Brewing Company is a good pic for lunch. We stopped by the RRBC on a Sunday for a bit to eat and were very pleased with the service and had a decent bar food lunch. There is plenty of parking onsite, access could be a bit difficult for some due to sloped driveway and parking lot. The vibe is right for a brewery with large brew kettles and tanks well displayed behind glass windows as you enter the pub. Nice wooden bar and tiered dinning room with lots of hard wood giving a relaxed feeling to the establishment. 

There was a good crowd at the bar and in the dinning areas with a board variety of guests. Bunch of dudes watching football at the bar and several families with kids in tow in the restaurant. Seating was ample and we were far enough from the youngest dinner, some of them needing a bit of ""juice"" to settle them down.

We were seated very quickly on the upper tier dinning area and our waitresses was over quickly to take our drink orders, wine from my better half (she is not a beer fan) and the Coopers Klosh for me. The menu is pretty large for a pub with lots of apps, salads, sandwiches, burgers and larger main dishes.  My wife went with the salmon while I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and the soup of the day, Italian weeding. 

We had to laugh as I was enjoying the soup due to the music selection playing. I do love me some Jethro Tull, seen them many times in concert, but not feeling it when Cross Eyed Mary was playing overhead. Call me odd but a song about a child streetwalker is not my go to listening at lunchtime. The rest of the piped in music was all 60 &70's classic rock. The level was alright not overly load. I just 
glad we were not subjected to more Christmas music!

My wrap was good with the chicken cooked through but not dried out. I would have preferred more heat but my tolerance for heat is pretty high on the scale. The portion size of the wrap was also very large. The fries were good considering they are beer battered, again a preference thing and you might like the battered fries. My wife's salmon was also cooked very well, done but not dried out. My wife was not crazy about the topping nor the balsamic glaze on the plate, stating that it was a bit more acid than needed for the salmon.

We visit the RRBC several times a year, usually for lunch. A very nice place for a good brew and food that is definitely better than the national family chains like Applebee's and Fridays.",2

13172,1,1551312000000,"I love Red Rock Canyon! Actually, I love the hiking just outside the conservation area even more, because it's free and less crowded and you don't have to drive the Scenic Loop.

Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not a TOTAL cheapo.  $20 ain't nothin if you live here and hike all the time.  Just sayin' if you're looking for a deal, there's Calico Basin (with official parking lot, picnic tables, restrooms) and Oak Creek (side-of-road parking, easy to miss) just up the road.  Plus, while the Scenic Drive is BEAUTIFUL, it's 13 miles and sometimes you just wanna get out and get hiking already!!

I love to bring my dog here! All trails are dog-friendly, but dogs (by law, I think) are supposed to be on a 6' or less leash.  Now, this is followed by some people, and not by others.  I will plead the 5th on this; but if you are hiking with little or no one around and have a friendly, well-behaved dog, you might let your dog have some freedom.

for non-desert folks: BEWARE - the sandstone here is very rough/sharp and dogs can easily get cuts in their paw pads.  There are cacti everywhere and dogs get spines in their mouths, between their toes -- all over!! Bring a pair of tweezers!  If it's super hot out, look for some shade, but be careful b/c rattlesnakes like shade too! (A friend's dog almost sat on one recently.)

Oak Creek is a great hot weather hike b/c there is a little flowing creek that the dogs can splash around in and cool off.",2
13172,3,1550880000000,"This used to be our place to stop for lunch when we shopped in the area and I must've been there a dozen times. Generally eating cheap Italian food like this makes you feel kind of shitty in the end but that's something we always factored in as it's expected so that's fine - the food is reasonably tasty for the price.

Recently we ate there and suddenly my wife literally had to run to the bathroom to throw up. The food didn't taste off or anything and we thought maybe she ate too fast or maybe the food was too heavy as she ate very little in the morning. 

As we were leaving I went to the men's washroom and one of the sinks was full of vomit. I notified the management about this - when there are around 10 people in the restaurant and two cases of throwing up at the same time it's not an accident anymore. The management basically told us that it can't be their food, everything's done fresh etc. and added ""but thanks for telling us"". 

It was clear at this point that no responsibility is taken - or even admission that it could potentially be their food that's causing the problem. Of course it's possible that two customers out of 10 happen to throw up for some other reason within 30 minutes - but the chances are pretty close to zero.

I walked out and will not be back. I simply can't reward an establishment that flat out denies the possibility of their food being defective and offers no compensation (or even a partial refund..!) for a ruined day and the humiliation of throwing up in the public. I see now why past comments have multiple references to poor service and customer care.",2

Service is great in that the staff are wonderful and very friendly.  However the wait times were unbelievable! My favourite ramen joints back home in Vancouver take no more than ten minutes maximum, so that's the point of reference that I've always had.  I was waiting here for 27 minutes for a plain shoyu ramen, and then my friend's bowl arrived five minutes after.  The whole time we were eating, the line-up at the door had the exact same faces.  I'm sure this place is making some good business since it always seemed lined up, but I think business could get even better for them if they just reduced their turnover time by speeding up how fast they get dishes out of the kitchen.

Sadly I don't think this place is worth the wait--it looks like both people here on Yelp and people that I've spoken to quite like this place, but personally I just didn't like the ramen as I felt it lacked flavour.  My standards for ramen are (I guess) a little high, it has been my favourite dish since I visited Tokyo.  After that trip, I realized just how important the broth is, and it just didn't quite cut it for me here, but it looks like everyone else seems to like it.  3-Stars because it's not bad by any means and the people are nice, but I might have felt very disappointed to eat bland ramen had I waited in that line for over forty minutes like everyone else--phew!",1

Considering the quality of the food, the prices are very reasonable - they use high quality ingredients judging from what I have seen and tasted.  Small place but very nicely done bright cheery decor.  Fairly simple chalkboard menu, but there is more than meets the eye.  The grilled cheese sandwich is so much more than its name suggests.  Try it, you'll have a whole new appreciation for the namesake. The short rib sandwich is probably the best sandwich I've ever had.  Anywhere.   There is also a salad made with kale that makes you wonder why kale isn't a salad staple, it's also incredible.  And for something a bit different, the lobster roll is another favorite of mine.  Have been there for breakfast a few times, love the coffee, scones, and the wrap is something pretty special for starting the day off loving life.  It's a pretty small place and can get busy at lunch, but the staff are friendly and keep everything moving, never losing the quality focus.  Highest recommendation.",3

I've eaten at this location several times in the past. While I found their steaks marginal and less appealing than other steak franchises,  my friends appear to like the atmosphere of outback.

My last trip I ordered a ribeye steak, what I got was a strip steak. I called attention to my steak with the waitress and a manager came out and assured me it was a ribeye steak. ...No it wasn't!    As I was with friends, I did not argue with the manager, I smiled politely as I did not want to create a scene. 

 I buy ribeye steaks all the time, and choose them as my steak at restaurants. I understand the variations in ribeye steaks. What I received that night at outback was not a ribeye steak.

At $4.75, the small nutella hot chocolate (with no whipped cream!) wasn't worth it. It was far too small for that price. Taste wise, it was sort of mediocre. Nothing special about it. 

However, the cookies made up for the subpar hot chocolate! We ordered the chocolate chip and chocolate walnut cookies. It was delicious. The middle was soft and the chocolate was melty! The outer edge was crunchy. Best of both words and again, very delicious. They were big (in terms of diameter) and really thick (maybe 1""). The only downside is that they're probably upwards of 400 calories and they disappeared so quickly! 

I would give my visit 4.5 stars. The missing 0.5 star is because the hot chocolate was small for the price and rather subpar taste-wise.",2

The place is small and can get crowded, especially at lunch time.  I prefer lunch here, as the prices are better.  The spices taste authentic and it is nice you can get the level of heat you want (1 for mild; 5 for hot).  The 5 isn't terribly hot, so if you like Thai food even a bit spicy, I would tend towards 4 or 5.  The Drunken Noodles were very good, but the other dishes I tried were good too.",2

I've tried most of their sandwiches but my favorite is the Moroccan. They make soups daily which are always delicious. Whenever they have the roasted vegetable quiche, I have to have it. It is so flavorful and the best part is that their dough is imported from France. I've had plenty of quiches but they have the best quiches in Vegas by far. They serve illy coffee as well which is a plus. The owner Olivier, always spreads good energy to all of his customers. Aside from the amazing food, Olivier really strives to satisfy all of his customers which I feel is one of the main reason this business does so well.

The waiting time is usually under 15 mins, the longest I've been to was slightly over 30 mins, and that was around Chinese New Year. Mongolian Grill is nice, baby corn and steaks are must try, and grilled pineapple can be rather delicious. They have canadian snow crab, and that's an incredibly delicious option.

First time having a pizza with cauliflower crust and I do recommend it. Dylan was our exceptional server and he deserves acknowledgement!  The only thing that turned us off was watching a female waitress wipe up a spilled drink on the floor with a white towel then proceeded to wipe the chair and lastly wiped the table with the same towel.....WOW!!!  What kept us from being totally grossed out was the bus boy came with his own towel and wiped down the entire table. I guess this is why I never eat anything that falls onto the table as one never knows if or how they get cleaned!,2

13373,3,1549497600000,"I've been going to Lynn Felix at Etch from the time the salon opened about 10 years ago.  The salon is modern,  clean and I am always treated nicely by the front desk staff, but Lynn is the only reason I go there.  She used to own her own salon and her years and years of experience has made going to get my hair cut and colored a relaxing experience instead of an hour of nail biting terror waiting to see if I like the results!   She never cuts more than I ask and when I went to her for highlights, the first time ever, I was even more impressed by her.  She is a true hair professional.   She has her own curly hair so she knows how to cut curly hair to look great when you want to wear it straight or curly, and that's not an easy thing to do.  If you are looking for a hair stylist who knows what she is doing, is fast, professional then you have to look no further.  The only problem with Etch has nothing to do with Lynn or the salon itself, is the parking during season.  The parking lot where Etch is located is small to begin with and a Valet station has taken two whole rows closest to the salon for it's own use.  The problem is the area is blocked off but there is never anyone at the Valet station.  So if you can't valet the car and you try to find a space during season, especially on Saturdays (any time of the year) you are forced to drive around for several, and I mean five to ten minutes or go into the parking garage which will result in a little walk so bring comfy shoes.   I think the Valet should park the cars in the garage and let the lot be for self parkers.   It makes no sense to take up the spaces 20 feet from the salon, where a client can easily walk, to make things easier for the valet.",2

I also was impressed that I got continuous updates as they tracked down the part and stayed on me to get it installed.

13420,1,1550448000000,"Pros: The LVH is located on the monorail. This is our preferred method of travel when we visit, so that is good. Get the three day pass and use it often!

The pool was large and the waitstaff at the pool bar were friendly. 

There are remnants from the Star Trek Experience on the first level, so if you are a nerd, that's cool. 

The Sunday brunch buffet was a decent value. $19.99 per person including champagne. 

The room was clean when we arrived, and all appliances/amenities worked well. 

It was a good deal overall. Its hard to complain when the room is so inexpensive. 

Cons: The Comedy After Dark Show was terrible. We weren't seated until after 10:45pm for the 10pm show, and the first two comics were ""meh"", and the host was loud and not funny. The headliner was much better, but I was exhausted by the time he came out. 

The check-in line was long when we arrived on a Friday morning at 11am. 

Wifi for $14 a day is ridiculous. 

The bar staff located directly outside of the Tempo Lounge (the bar with video poker machines built in) were rude and completely ignored me for 5 minutes before I walked away in search of a drink elsewhere. 

Housekeeping did not clean our room on the second day. We left around noon, and were gone until 8pm - they had plenty of time to drop off new shampoo & make the bed.",2

Not only has she created a place where people wanting a step up from a table at Starbucks can park their laptops, she's created a sense of community with all of her tenants.  So even though they all work for themselves, they work together as well.

I've been to a few social events there as well, and think it's a great, user-friendly venue.  CO+HOOTS also sponsored Get Your PHX's first Phoestivus event, which was much appreciated.  They clearly view themselves as neighborhood members, not just a business needing to pay its bills.

I was also able to find my awesome Santa Monica co-working space through Jenny, as these business owners are all very well connected.

There are always cute photo opts/props out front, usually coinciding with the season/time of the year. There's also a sweet little farm animal pen outside. They are very kid & family friendly too.

Ordered seafood tower (which is ala carte price), they just put it all together. We also got Sautéed sea scallop and Japanese A5 for him. With the side dish of mashed potato and button mushroom. As well as glass of wine for each. Our server put out a dessert for a birthday.

Beautifully decorated restaurant, the red embroidered tablecloths, cloth embroidered menus, small mosaic pictures on the walls, the rugs, evil eyes, Turkish music, Turkish lamps and decorations, add to the appeal of this place. It feels small, and cozy.

This place only has lamb, chicken, shrimp, or salmon kebabs by the way. No beef at all.

The cold cubed fried eggplant appetizer was delicious. It was topped with a tomato sauce with a little garlic. Some of the pita was soft and warm, and some rather hard and crispy.

The mixed chicken plate was pretty good. The cubes of chicken, ground chicken patties were on top of a bed of long grained rice. There was half a grilled green pepper, shredded iceberg lettuce, red lettuce strips, a few halves of cherry tomatoes, and tzaziki sauce to pour over the chicken. 

The salgam was a very tart, salty drink of reddish-purple color. Must be an acquired taste.

Service was excellent.

The rice pudding was thick, very creamy, very sweet with firm grains of rice. There was the faintest sprinkle of cinnamon on top. The more I ate, the more I liked it.",2

I got the chicken parm with prosciutto sandwich and sweet potato fries, must say it was delicious! FYI- If you're getting a dish that comes with fries get the sweet potato fries they are to die for, and the garlic aioli is an awesome plus! A few people at my table of 12 weren't satisfied and we did send a Chicago steak back to the kitchen... But all in all not too shabby! And we did a pretty good job as we only had 1 doggy bag.
Our waitress was nice, a tad clumsy as she dropped quite a few things when clearing, but nice and hey I can understand when busy.

The Robuchon style is very elegant and sophisticated yet fun and whimsical at the same time.  Where else can you find strange little baubles and ribbon on your table and plate?  Presentation seems wacky if you pick pieces apart, but put it all together, and it works.  

I ate during truffle season!  This is the way to go-- wait for the truffle menu to come around.  The truffle tart was outrageous.  The bread cart and dessert trolley make the meal beyond great.  Where else does this happen?  (A side note: I ate at the French Laundry less than a month before Robuchon, and Robuchon blew FL out of the water.  At Robuchon I had 16 courses plus a bread trolley, sorbet and petit four trolley in 3 hours; at the Laundry we had 14 courses in 5 hours.  The French Laundry was seriously lagging and everything was sooo rich, we were full halfway through.  Unlike the French Laundry, the flow of service and amount of food at Robuchon were perfect.)

13593,1,1550534400000,"Beautiful! Beautiful! Beautiful!

I love the outdoors and coming to Vegas has never been my outdoors trip.... until the last trip we took where we visited the Red Rock Canyon. The colors of the rocks with the deep blue sky and the cottony white clouds above gave such beautiful contrasts, yet went so well together! Here I thought once again of the God's wonderful creation of our world and felt the awe and the greatness of our Creator! When I'm out in the nature with such awesomeness, I can't help but be blown away with the God's powers. Makes me take a big breath.... and the wonders of everything surrounding me just takes my breath away!

We were able to do one hike into the Calico Tank which took us into the rocks and ended up in a natural tank of water from the rain(?) and a beautiful view of the Vegas strip of the hotels in distance above the rocks. Such contrast in scenery and it was quite appealing.

13602,2,1550275200000,"Had the omakase sashimi dinner. At $75 for 20 pcs sashimi and a miso soup, it is a little overpriced. We also ended up ordering other dishes on the side, which jacked up the final cost by quite a bit more. The sashimi at Zen was very good, but the soft shell crab and tempura were mediocre. The beef tongue was quite nice though. 

I found that the menu selection here is very small. I don't expect to see 50 different kinds of westernized maki that you can get at your typical AYCE restaurant, but would be nice to see things like chirashi and maybe some other appetizer dishes like takoyaki or okonomiyaki. 

This new Woodbine Zen location is much nicer than the older one, and the food quality is excellent as usual. Great service and enjoyed dinner very much, but after paying $100+/person, I was still hungry. Ended up getting a $8 chicken on rice combo from another restaurant on the way home to fill me up. Would bump up the stars if menu selection is expanded and portions are increased.

I would for sure go back for Pad Thai though!",2
13622,3,1550275200000,"OVERALL: 8.9/10 (Yelp conversion: 5/5). Average based on the breakdown at the bottom of this review.

The AYCE here (for dinner) is extremely #worth if you can break even by eating at minimum 2 premium rolls (for example, $9.95 each for the sashimi or rainbow), and at least two orders of the premium 2pc sushi (for example, $4.95 for each of the oyster / salmon belly / uni). Everything else ordered past that (per person) is worth it since you already broke even (based on the a la carte prices on the menu, which are incredibly pricey for the portion sizes).

I was a party of 1 and there was an end seat at the sushi bar, which I gladly took. This made ordering extremely easy - I was in and out within 30 minutes of arriving, even after waiting 5 minutes after putting my name in the queue (4 parties ahead of me, all of size 2 or greater). 

After tax, the AYCE dinner came out to $28.03 (pre-tip). My experience was great, since the sushi chef was extremely attentive and helpful at describing what was good, although this may have been due to me sitting directly in front of him at the sushi bar.

1) VARIETY/SELECTION: 7/10. Had a decent selection & offering, but this is Las Vegas, which is in a landlocked state, and no access to fresh fish - you get what your geography gives you.

2) FRESHNESS: 8/10. Again, it's land-locked, don't go in expecting Kashiba-level freshness. This isn't near a farmer's market, nor is it going to taste as fresh as one.

3) VALUE FOR MONEY: 10/10. If I ordered the equivalent meal off of the a-la-carte menu (which is the same as the AYCE menu, but you pay the listed price instead of the AYCE price), I would have had to pay closer to $78, given that each of the premium rolls are $9.95 (I ordered 4), the 2pc sushi dishes were $4.95 each (I ordered 6), and other dishes ranged from $2.95 (cheaper sushi pieces) to $14.50 (Seafood Salad).

4) SERVICE: 9.5/10. This is somewhat biased since I was sitting at the sushi bar, and the sushi chef I could order from was literally serving only me and a few table orders (despite the place being packed to the point of a wait list). The wait staff weren't super attentive, and the -0.5 stars is from my water being not refilled for over 20 minutes (even though the wait staff camped behind me since that's where the point-of-sale device was).

5) PRICE: 10/10. I didn't eat lunch and wanted something filling, given that I had hiked this entire day. Needless to say, $33 including tip for an all-you-can-eat sushi meal is a bargain.

The atmosphere and decor is somewhat nice too; the TV was playing K-Pop songs the entire time I was there (I saw ""Gentleman"" and ""Hangover"" by PSY, as well as some K-Pop male idol group whose name escapes me). Interesting that a Japanese restaurant plays so much K-Pop.

No gimmicks, just straight value. It's all you can eat hot pot including unlimited meat and seafood. Included in the price, you can also get fried rice and skewers. I usually get the spicy and bone soup base. They are more traditional and tasty in my opinion to bring out the natural flavors of the ingredients.

13631,1,1549584000000,"Johnny's Bar on Fulton, while not a very big place, is charming. Unfortunately the gorgeous patio (read: garden) was full, so we sat indoors in a slightly cramped dining room. But that only added to the atmosphere. There was valet, but also parking on the side street not too far of a walk away. 

The server was friendly and attentive. I asked the server her preference between the on-menu walleye and the halibut special of the evening. The server recommended the halibut and I was not disappointed. 

The entree came with a house salad which was simple and small, but a good starter. The halibut was a good portion size. It came with rice and thin stalked asparagus. It was a flavorful and light option for dinner.

They have a clean facility and wonderful doctors. The day after Christmas, I woke up to a depressed lethargic dog, so I rushed her over to Arrow. 

They diagnosed her with Parvo, which is a terrible terrible disease spread by other infected dogs and is virtually impossible to kill or cure. There are treatments however, to which the doctors promptly got started on. I was really nervous as I watched her give my puppy an IV drip along with 5 other injections, mostly because I was going to be sent home with all these things that I was going to have to administer myself twice a day. I asked about 200 questions and the Dr. was so nice and helpful and very informative. She gave me an after hours number to call if I felt uneasy or had anymore Q's as well. 

The next day, she called me first thing in the morning to see how the pup (and myself) were doing.. And everyday after that, she called again, up until my dog got better. I really appreciated this. Not only that, but every single person working there genuinely cared about my dog, and it showed with how they treated her each time we went in for followups. I love all of them.

The complimentary garlic parmesan bread are big soft pieces of pillows -- be careful, you could get full off these alone -- but even that wouldn't be so bad because they are very good.  Though I only tried two pasta dishes - the carbonara and spaghetti with meatballs - both were delicious and more than enough to where you will surely have leftovers.   The sauce alone in the spaghetti tasted homemade and had so much flavor you would think a sweet Italian grandmother was back there whipping it up -- ya never know -- coulda been.

We all know that eating out in Vegas can add up, whether you're doing buffets or restaurants, but I'm happy to say that Trattoria Reggiano's prices are so reasonable that you will have plenty of paper leftover for the casinos and cocktails.  And the owner is a very friendly and accommodating man.

I appreciated that they had signs up front about this so there wouldn't be any surprises on the bill when we checked out. A little steep though that they would charge for early check in. Husband and I have stayed at hotels near Disneyland and were never charged for early check in. Anyway we probably took a total of 40 minutes waiting in line and getting checked in. The girl who was checking us in was in training. Husband and I were patient about it. Surprisingly the staff was nice. Price for the hotel is affordable (even with resort fee which is an extra $35) and very convenient since it's located right on the strip. The problem was when we got to our room. Luckily we didn't have any bed bugs or any unusual stains on the bed. However the room still felt dirty. The vents were incredibly dusty. The floor was dirty. I never walk barefoot in hotels, I always use socks. Socks were turning black. The bathroom was horrid. The lighting was awful. It was so dim and not in a romantic way, more of a horror movie way. The bath tub and shower curtain smelled like piss. Seemed like some drunko must have missed the toilet and decided to pee on the outside of the tub and on the shower curtain instead. 
FYI parking is $12. Beware of the time share holder people. I get that they are just doing their jobs but oh man they are annoying! There is express check in/out machines you could use. Or you can even check out online.

Great room.  I completely prefer rooms with a kitchenette or at least a fridge.  And since I was here for 4 nights, the set up at the trump was key.  Fridge, sink, stove top if you want it and microwave.  Beyond that the room is also a nice space, with a comfortable bed and good work area.  As mentioned by at least one other reviewer, the shower door situation is a little funky.  That probably could have been designed better.

Great fitness center.  There are a number of treadmills facing the pool area and a decent assortment of machines, too.  

Super convenient to be across from that mall.  Walk through Nordstrom and you've got yourself a Chipotle no more than 300 yards from front door of the hotel.  

Short walk to El Segundo Sol and StripBurger.

Short taxi lines.  I was here 4 nights and in and out multiple times per day.  Never had to wait more than 2 minutes for a taxi.  During CES.  

Only issue I had was upon check in.  I made my reservation through Booking.com and had adjusted the original reservation by adding a day.   Even though I'd done this at least four or five days before my arrival it wasn't picked up in 'their system'.  So I had to stand there while the desk guy called and faxed (yes, faxed) someone a copy of my booking.com confirmation.

Luigi 's comes pretty close, with nice slices of mozzarella and basil.  The pasta may not have been cooked in salted water, which left it bland.

I tried a local brewery called Hess - a wonderful Russian Imperial stout. Then I had a Belgian flight of 4 beers for $10. The Ovila Brandy Barrel Aged Stout was soooo yummy and my hubby even liked it and he's not a fan of stouts. The only downside is it was a limited run so I can't find it anywhere else. 

One caveat - this place is tiny and loud. We sat outside, which helped, but there were a couple very obnoxious, loud drunk people out on the patio.

It was super sweet and most of the guys passed on this. The bar service was extremely slow. Only one bartender for a very packed place. 
The main reason I liked and didn't like this place is because of the open rooftop. Liked it because it was a nice night and the fresh air is nice in a large crowd. Didn't like it because it meant there were people smoking.

Some of my favorite areas are the ones not crowded with tourists.  Follow the loop around to the far west side where there is less parking in the lots and those are some of the best hikes.  Icebox canyon, a must!  Everywhere along the road the views are crazy and sometimes you may even see a few burros running around.

What I do have a problem with now is that you can't even walk or bike in for free anymore.  So when I don't feel like paying or don't want to buy a new year pass I just hop over the Calico and do hiking over there.  You can hike into Red Rock for free!",1

We started with the guacamole with blue cheese and duck confit, and then split a few orders of tacos: Korean, Pollo & Al Pastor.  Everything was really tasty and was reminiscent of my favorite taco joint in Chicago (shout out to Big Star!) so I was impressed.  Service was friendly and the space was done really well.  I think it caters to bigger parties as if you go with only 2 people, you are seated at a high top near the bar.  My only gripe is that I thought it was a bit expensive.

On top of that, they don't even let you wait til your nails are dry before making you pay - they go into your purse and ""help"" you take your cash / cards out which seems really weird to me.

I worked in the hotel industry for 5 years, and I'm an elite Marriott member, and I don't like to critique negatively, but this property needs a sound slamming. So my hub and I check into this place at midnight a few days ago and the night auditor has two dudes pounding McDonald's and staring at us when we check in. The room is smoky because the next door room is smoking (despite being a smoke free property) and the room is in dusty disrepair. I do check mattresses upon check in  because bed bugs and other nasties are prevalent, and I find multiple blood stains and vomit stains as well as bug excrement shells. I call the front desk and get the night auditor who can't understand why I might possibly need anything- she is visibly annoyed. We get a new room after much prodding and explanation- and it's marginally better than the last. This property is clearly an older Courtyard- they came in and redid the lobby, leaving the rooms almost original to the property. 

So eventually we get a new, marginally better room and after spraying the room with lysol and freaking out over the hazmat-type scene, we tried to sleep over the bed linens. I woke up around 4am with itching and red spots.

We could have gone somewhere else, but we had just walked into Planet Hollywood, so we went for PD. First, I thought the menu was weak. There were not as many options as I've grown accustomed to at casino cafe's, and the prices were insane. I got an egg white scramble and paid about $15.00. It came with two pieces of toast, and a small heap of fries. Other members of my family had equally pricey meals.

Bouchon is a FANTASTIC place for breakfast, so my early morning alarm, stumble out of the Wynn, and confused wandering was all worth it.

First, this place is cozy. It's small, has lots of booths and tables, and overlooks a nice courtyard. Even better, upon walking in, you see giant baskets full of fluffy pastries and croissants. How tantalizing!

Next, the staff was very friendly with me (maybe because I was eating by myself??), and the food came out quickly.

Now, about the food. SO DELICIOUS. I ordered enough for three people. No kidding...

Strawberry croissant - think of a croissant sliced in half with top removed, inside filled with slices of strawberry and cream, covered in crumble, then baked. And then, as they bring out the little containers of butter and marmalade, proceed to spread said pastry with those condiments. So gooey, warm, sweet, tantalizing!

Chocolate Spiced Beignets - comes three a plate, covered in sugar, and served hot. Comes with nutella and homemade cherry jam to spread. So good. Makes a regular donut seem shameful.

Croque Madame - brioche bread with ham, cheese, and a fried egg on top and mornay sauce. I requested mine to not have ham, since I'm not a fan of ham. Comes with a large side of thin frites. Oh  man. I downed this dish in minutes, it was so buttery and I loved the way the fried egg yolk spread over and into the brioche bread, which itself was drowning in cheese and butter. OMG.

I hate giving bad reviews but there is no excuse for my experience. We came here for Mother's Day. Had a reservation set but didn't manage to be seated for over 30 minutes after our reserved time. Once we were seated we didn't see our server for over 10 minutes- this means we didn't even have water to sip on while we waited. 

Once we were given our water and menus- we didn't even have the chance to order for another 15-20 min as our server disappeared again. 

Long story short we finally ordered our food (took another hour or so before we received it), and they brought me the wrong thing. They ""quickly"" fixed it and got me the correct food. It was mediocre (at most) and I didn't even finish it. It looked/tasted like they gave me a dried out hamburger bun by wonder bread (you know... Hostess brand). 

When we got the bill they charged us for the incorrect order and we had to point it out to them. 

In all fairness they tried to right the wrong and took my item off as well as their required 18% gratuity. But even with the comp'd food, our bill was still over $200. 

Their desserts were amazing BUT definitely not worth $200 for a chocolate crunch. 

The entire dinner was 3 hours long. And it wasn't long because we finished eating and decided to talk. We were WANTING to leave but we hadn't even received out meal yet. 

Btw it wasn't that busy so I can't says ""well it was a holiday and they were busy"".  This place needs to get its act together as I've seen places like Olive Garden that are more organized and efficient than this place. And I refuse to eat at Olive Garden.

Located in a strip mall across from the Chapters, there is ample parking in front of the restaurant. I was confused by the exterior and almost thought it was take out and delivery only, but there are multiple chairs and tables inside if you wish to stay. There were only one table other than us, but the kitchen seemed extremely busy regardless, so I assume most people visit this place for take out and delivery. 

We were famished so we got one rice dish, garlic nan, and two curry dishes. We were worried it wouldn't be enough, but curry always seems to fill me more than I expect. 

I was sad that they didn't have anything similar to a coconut rice dish here so I opted for the egg rice which was basically a egg scrambled in rice. Surprisingly really good with curry!

I also got the mango lassi and really enjoyed it. It was good but I wish it was served colder. 

Our bill was only 35$ (inc. tip) which was not bad at all for the amount of food we got (plus a drink!). Usually for the amount of food we got, at other places we easily pay over 50$.

If you live in the area and they deliver, I would definitely give this place a try. Can't comment on the service for delivery but when we dined in, they were very pleasant. 

I took a star off because of my lukewarm lassi and the food did take a while to come out but I hope that's an indication that everything is prepared somewhat fresh.",2

13993,1,1549670400000,"I tried this place for the first time. It isn't close to where I live but I was dropping someone at the airport. That being said, I will be making the trip here more often. The restaurant sits in an unsuspectingly small corner, which is fine because the staff (presumably the owner) were all super friendly, enthusiastic, and obviously enjoyed what they were doing. For about 8 bucks you can get a huge frybread taco that is enough for two meals. By no means did they sacrificed quality for quantity. The fry bread was cooked to perfection, a nicely browned exterior with a soft spongy interior. I had the green Chile and red Chile beef split half and half and honestly cannot say which side I enjoyed more. Highly recommend this place and I can't wait to go back and explore the menu further.",2
13998,1,1549929600000,"Went in for a chocolate glazed donut. It was not good. Very dense, doughy, and did not taste like chocolate. Didn't really taste like anything. I don't see how that's possible. For $3, I could have had 2 Tim hortons chocolate glazed donuts.

The girl working was very nice though!",2

Sean/Shawn (not sure of the spelling) called us and talked us through the issue. He gave us options of having him come out ASAP or scheduling someone to come out in the morning when it was more convenient for us. He was courteous and very helpful. We'll definitely call Mr. Rooter for any future issues.",2
14011,3,1550793600000,"I just don't feel the Samba vibe.  I have eaten here twice, and both times I had about a table spoon of filet.  They like to push you on pork, chicken, sausage, sirloin, etc...  If I want to eat horrible cuts of meat I can go to the store and buy the on sale crap.  When I go out I'm expecting top quality meat.

Perhaps they need to raise prices?  I don't have the answer... but never serving good stuff is why I don't think I will go back to this place.

Other items are decent... skirt steak, leg of lamb.  However the meat is not very tender (choice quality?) it is seasoned very well, and this makes it at least flavorful.

I found the drinks very nice but somewhat pricey.

I've eaten at Brazillian style grills many times, and of the four I've tried this is perhaps the lowest on the list for reasons above.  

I can think of one in Texas that at these same prices was far superior.",3

From the remodeled food court to the hundreds of new stores they have added.  Back in the 70's and 80's it was nothing like this when I was growing up.  It basically was this hollow shell of  a place that housed  offices and janitorial rooms and as kids we used to race our bikes thru the halls for fun.

I can honestly say this is the best pizza I've ever had. It's the only time I've eaten a piece of pizza and my mouth immediately started watering for a second piece. Expensive but worth it. Real Wisconsin cheese, not stingy with the spices and an amazing selection of meat. The only negative thing I have to say about Oregano's is that it is making me gain weight like crazy. Shame on you for making such an irresistible pizza!",2
14046,3,1549411200000,"Honestly, the burritos here are delicious, which is why I almost feel bad giving them only 3 stars. However, the service here is atrocious and in the 2 or so years I've been going here, it hasn't gotten any better.

They recently changed their hours and close three and a half hours earlier than they used to. However, they haven't updated the hours on their website and the other day when I pulled up after closing, the ""Open"" sign was still lit and the doors unlocked. After standing in the deserted lobby for a few seconds, an employee finally poked his head from around the corner and told me they were closed.

Some of the staff are friendly, but then others have an attitude that makes you think you're doing them a major inconvenience by walking through their doors. I get that it's a fast-casual style restaurant, but customer service is still an important tenet.

Finally, they consistently don't have certain items ready. I've come in during different times (lunch rush, afternoon, evening) on different days, and it seems like they're almost always out of something major like chicken, beans, or rice.

Again, the food here is delicious, but I have an internal struggle every time I crave Pancheros to decide if the food is worth the terrible service.",2
14048,3,1549670400000,"Fugu was the first Chinese Restaurant I went to after first arriving at Madison, because I heard that it is a good place for authentic Sichuan food. But it was a huge disappointment.

We went around 12 o'clock, and although it was bright and sunny on the outside, the inside was very dark. There was not enough light on, and that was not good for bringing up our appetite. There were only two waitresses who seemed to be new on this job, one of them even accidentally spilled water all over some other costumer.

The food, well, the flavour is not bad, but it is definitely NOT authentic. We ordered water-boiled pork and fish-flavoured eggplant (sorry guys can't remember what exact English names they put on the menu). These are two of the signature dishes of Sichuan food that I like the most, but what they brought to us was definitely not how these dishes supposed to be. Fish-flavoured? I would call it sweet-and-sour, and trust me, these are totally different flavours. As for water boiled pork, it was supposed to be soupy (guess one can tell by their literal-translated name), but somehow the cook decided to add wet starch and created something different. Again, flavour-wise it is not bad, but I would never call that water boiled pork.

Since later we soon discovered a much, much better Sichuan food place nearby, I will definitely never go back to this dark little place again, and I will not recommend this place to any Chinese friends. However, if all you had was American-style Chinese take-away food before, then you may find this place not bad at all.",2
14054,2,1549670400000,"Came here for a work workshops and I'll probably not come back until they upgrade the basic necessities to please a customer.  I was assigned the 27th floor in the habitat elevators.

cons:
-arrived 1130pm to check in.  while waiting for an hour in a long line, my buddy had enough time to buy us two slices of pizza.  We finished it and we weren't anywhere closer to the the front of the line.  There were 3 employees at the front desk checking in a line that was more than 25 people long. -- take advantage of online check-in if you can

-elevators go to every floor.  What does that mean for someone on the 27th floor?  Stops at every floor imaginable going up and down.  Watching people hop on and off while I wait to reach for the skiies.  It's worse going down because it stops at every floor for everyone trying to get the heck out of their floors.

-Advised to keep keycard away from phone.  Um. . .it's 2015 and everyone has a phone.  I'll need my keycard and phone while I wander the strip and need to return to my temporary abode.  My consequence? Keycard denies my entry to my room and I stand in front of my room like a reject.  Then I proceed back down the elevator to get my card fixed and go back up.  Precious time wasted.

-hot water takes a while to flow

-heater didn't work

pros
-they offer a $7 shuttle direct to airport, picks up every 15 minutes
-central to the strip
-peaceful fish ponds and flamingos",1

14096,2,1550707200000,"Well I came from my last grocery store being the Fry's on Camelback and 7th Ave which is a total dump. Anything is a step up from that place so, respectfully, my review can be taken with a grain of salt. 

That said, this location certainly has potential (finger crossed that the light rail extension doesn't turn this into a certain aforementioned Fry's). Half the square footage is like outdoor furniture stuff or something and I always see people messing around over there so it must be good. For my two cents, I like that the important stuff is all together. Produce, butcher, dairy isn't spread all over the place like most stores. Also, the staff has always been helpful to me so kudos for that. 

I'll be keeping an eye on this Fry's for sure.",2
14102,1,1549411200000,"If it forced to eat one type of food for the rest of my life, it would be pizza.  I never tire of pizza simply because there are so many interpretations possible, and I'm not just talking about toppings.  From the flavorless cardboard pizzas from Peter Piper (for which I will always hold a place in my heart) to the foodie favorites crafted at world famous Pizzeria Bianco, Arizona is a pizza lovers paradise.  But among all of these various pies, my very favorite would have to be the Artichoke Pizza at Humble Pie.
      Immediately upon walking into Humble Pie, you are immediately struck by the wood burning oven, where pizzas are being expertly spun in and out and onto your plate.  The heat from this oven allows your crust to be cooked within minutes, and produces a smoky black char that adds so much depth of flavor--this isn't the result of neglecting to set a timer.  The crust is able to develop this color not only because of the immense heat of the oven, but also because of fermentation of the dough.  Fermenting the dough not only aids in the cooking process, but also adds that slightly sour tang you can taste in the dough.  Developing flavors over days, rather than hours, is a testament to this restaurant's dedication to quality and taste.
      With such a strong base, it's difficult to see how you could screw up such a good thing.  While I have enjoyed many different pizzas here, my all time favorite would have to be the Artichoke.  Delicate artichoke hearts are accented with gooey fontina cheese, mild fresh ricotta, sweet caramelized onions, with the briny bite of olives to cut through it all.   Other toppings range from just as creative to the traditional cheese or pepperoni.  But don't let traditional fool you into thinks average.  Humble Pie highlights local vendors in their locally made sausages and organically grown vegetables. Anytime there are less miles between the purveyor and your plate, there is almost a guarantee that the flavor will be better.
      As for the rest of the menu, the burrata Caprese and antipasto platter starters are two of my favorites, and again highlight simple, quality ingredients.  Typically, my dining partner and I will split one of these and a pizza.  Salads are okay, but don't quite have the impact of the milky, gooey cheese of the Caprese.  I have not had their sandwiches or pasta dishes, but can only assume that with the quality of ingredients being used, there can't be much to complain about.  The kids' menu contains the usual suspects, but the pizza is of the same quality of the adult menu.  (Do be aware that the kids' macaroni and cheese is Kraft.)
       The service is always friendly, with the owner stopping by your table often, and encourages leisurely meals.  I actually chose this venue to host my birthday party, which included around ten adults and four children under the age of five.  All of the orders were correct, the quality of food just as phenomenal as always, and they were incredibly helpful with our request of separate checks.  Overall, Humble Pie is one of my favorite spots in the Valley to enjoy myself with my family and good food.",2
14102,2,1550793600000,"I was driving home from work when I saw a sign advertising chinese take out-- talk about perfect timing! Located in the corner of the shopping center, Chopstix looks like your normal Chinese take out spot with advertisements of lunch specials plastered all over the windows. 

When I walked in, there was no one in there. In fact, it looked like the cooks and the cashier were having dinner on one of the tables. I felt bad when they all jumped up from the table to take my order. They have a variety of dishes on their menu, but I settled on the combination plate. For $7 and some change, the combination gets you an entree of your choice (there is a list of about 10 different dishes), chicken fried rice and a veggie egg roll. In about 10 minutes my food was ready to go! I like that. 

Since my first visit last week, I have already stopped by THREE times! It is probably not a healthy habit, but it is better than binging on Del Taco next door. I have ordered the mongolian beef, shrimp with lobster sauce, sesame chicken and general tso chicken. The general tso chicken was probably the tastiest and it will definitely be my go to choice. As far as portions go, Chopstix is fairly generous and I can usually have left overs for lunch the next day. 

Chopstix is an upgrade from Panda Express-- and cheaper (and faster) than Pei Wei. A good choice when you're in the area and want an alternative to the usual fast food choices.",2

She let me know they were running behind due to the previous job, and they stayed longer at my house to address everything. Alex notified me that part of a blind broke during cleaning (not a big deal - I'm replacing them anyway) and was very responsive when I asked about the inside of a closet! She dropped what she was working on and took care of it immediately so I could move boxes into it.

So enter the ever dependable ""search for Irish bars"" on Yelp mobile.  Jack's Pub?  There's an Irish bar in Palace Station?  I called them and they informed me of some of the specials they had on top of their current happy hour deals and it sounded like a plan.  When I asked the manager if it was crowded there, her response was ""It's filling up."" Translation: ""Plenty of seats!!"".

$3 beers, half price on all appetizers and $8 plates of corned beef and cabbage!  That's all they needed to say.  Decent food and atmosphere while watching my NCAA basketball brackets go down in flames.

Our waitress was great, but the food sucked - sorry :-(. Mostly Chinese fast-food type (and I'm Chinese..wanted to try something more 'American') so a lot of the food looked like Panda Express.

Salads/pastas can be intimidating because you literally have to choose your own ingredients to make your own salad/pasta. This is good and bad. Considering it's a buffet, it usually is better to showcase appealing (or at least try to) pre-made food. It's bad for those who don't know what the heck to put and I just decided to mix in all the ingredients together. BAD choice.  My parents don't speak English so it was very hard for them to order any salad/pastas. Wish it was in a 'bar' instead. 

The only beef there was pre-sliced beef! Buffets in Vegas are known for their beef tripe or whatever where the 'chef' stands there and slices it for you. The turkey was already pre-sliced too. :-(

The crab legs are ok - had better ones elsewhere and they were too salty - maybe it is to hide the 'freshness' of the crab legs?

The only good meat were the pork ribs and bbq sauce - tender and yummy!!

The mini donuts were cute! But they were stale :-(.  Desert area was also lacking.

We paid $26.99 for each adult (weekend dinner price) and it was too overpriced! We waited in line for 40 minutes... AND I saw there were lots of seats inside, they just didn't have enough waiters I guess.",3

This is a restaurant that everyone should pretty much know what they are getting into when they walk in, a bar style place with cheap/good food. Every food item on the menu is only $5, that's right $5 so anyone who complains that the quality might not match a $20 burger is kind of a moron. Today we came in around lunch time and as usual the place was pretty busy. Upon being seated the waitress took our order and was fast and friendly the entire visit. I ordered a turkey sandwich which had stuffing on it (which is a personal weakness) and it came was seasoned fries. The sandwich was good and so were the fries, well worth the whopping $5 it cost. Overall this is a fun place to stop at and with prices like these, I can't see this place ever failing.",2

She was so knowledgeable and I knew right then and there that I was going to go through their program. I had the pleasure of meeting Jasmine who is the owner and I was even more inspired. Her wealth of knowledge is like no other and you can feel the passion and dedication she has for teaching and sharing her knowledge. She truly took the time to explain everything and I really appreciated the one on one setting that she created for her students. Jasmine really cared about making sure that I had everything that I was going to need to succeed.

14263,2,1551139200000,"So I went here recently with my parents and husband.  My parents have been raving about this place since they first discovered it a few months ago.  They told me it's like T&T but bigger and better.  

When we first got there, we headed to the food court for something to eat.  The food court is similar to T&T except that it has not just Chinese food, but other cuisine as well.  They had Indian food, a shawarma station, and some North American food as well.  The prices were dirt cheap.  We got a huge container of General Tao's Chicken for $3.99.  And an equally huge container of Veal Biriyani for $3.99.  My husband wanted to try the beef pie (it was like a chicken pot pie, but beef and not in an aluminium pie container) ($2.99).  It was an individual serving size.  We also got some Har Gow - 4 for $1.99.  I got a strawberry sago drink ($1.59) and my mom got the taro one.   

The General Tao's Chicken was delicious.  Mostly white breast meat, not too much batter.  Hot and cripsy.  Mostly sweet, with a bit of tang.  Not spicy at all though.  The Veal Biriyani was mostly rice, not too much veal.  And the little veal that it contained was really fatty and had tendons and other sinewy bits.  There was also pieces of bone.  I was not a fan.  The rice itself was nicely spiced and had a spicy kick to it, which I enjoyed, but this did not make up for the aforementioned disappointment.  The Har Gow was great.  Just like at any respectable dim sum restaurant.  The beef pie was mostly crust and not enough pie, however my husband said that overall he enjoyed it.  The sago drinks were good.  They are a little bit like bubble tea except the bubbles are made of tiny tapioca beads so they are really soft and translucent and not chewy and dark like traditional bubble tea.  They also have some pieces of gelatin in it.  Mine tasted like strawberry milk with tapioca and gelatin pieces.    

The grocery store itself is very large.  Lots of spaces in the aisles.  They have a huge variety of ethnic foods.  Prices are really good for some items and about average for others.  The bulk section looked a little dirty, as people took stuff and then changed their minds and just left the bagged bulk foods in the bulk food area.  I'm not sure what they do with that food at the end of the day, whether they throw it out, keep it bagged and sell it at a discount, or dump it back into the bulk containers to sell the following day.  The bulk area looked much messier than everywhere else.  The bakery area is also a bit messy.  They have large trays of baked goods stacked on top of each other and you can go and bag your own baked goods.  I'm sure when they first bring everything out it looks good, but by the evening, things are picked over and it looks messy and unhygienic and people could have dropped items on the floor and then just put them back on the trays.  The washrooms are also filthy.  Do not go to the washrooms unless you really have to.  With the exception of these 3 areas, the rest of the store looks very clean and orderly.  The contrast is quite remarkable.  They need to clean up their act with the bulk section, the bakery and the washrooms.  I don't know why they let these places get so bad while the rest of the store is so much nicer.  

Parking is plentiful, and seating in the food court area is ample.",2

The Good, The Bad and The Ugly

The Good:
- The server was nice and helpful!
- The inside decor and environment is better than most AYCE Sushi places that I have been to.
That's pretty much it.

The Bad:
- Food quality is mediocre. The sushi rolls were overfilled with rice. Seeweed papers on sushi were chewy. 
- The sashimi did not seem fresh at all.
-  Asked for Strawberry Cheese Cake and got store bought New York Cheese cake with few drops of strawberry jam on top.
- Asked for a regular green tea and got Jasmine green tea instead. They also charge you for this green tea even though you are paying $31 per person..
- Food Quality is not worth $31 at all.

The Ugly:
- This one is my favourite: I asked for a Dark Chocolate Cake and I got store bought Two Bite brownie with chocolate sauce on top. Classic!
- We got charged 12% service charge and we were only two people..We did send back 2-3 dishes because it simply did not taste good. I am not sure if we were charged because of that, but if anyone is considering this ""sushi"" place, please confirm about this service charge before ordering.",2

My most recent visit was for a hair cut with one of their senior stylists, Stephen, and I left the salon with a great cut! I showed him some photos of the cut I wanted and he totally delivered. He was also very helpful in giving me some tips on how to style my hair according to my wavy texture and gave me some ideas and feedback on hair colour (as I mentioned that I may do that in the near future).

In a panic we called and the team was amazing. Kassie got the reservation moved from the other location to this one. The team worked like swift ninjas to make sure we had a party room and everything that we had set up for the other location. I later found out that she, along with manager Jade, were feverishly texting back-and-forth to make certain we were taken care of. 

When we arrived Lexie, our party host, greeted us with such energy. She was fully up to speed and knew what was going on. It was if we were on their schedule the entire time. She was a fantastic host, the kids had a blast, and this was one of the best birthday parties we had in years.

Yes a Jimmy Johns out of bread. 

Most frustrating of all, the service is just not welcoming. 

Other locations nearby offer a full menu and more personable service (Euclid) so I avoid going to this location despite it being closer to my home. By the way, subway is right down the street. Don't like subway as much but head to head in this situation, subway is better.",2

We're seated and I will give credit to the server as she was very pleasant and attentive.  There was rarely a time a beverage glass was empty. 

The food leaves a lot to be desired.  I had the carne asada taco plate with a side of guacamole.  It was as if nothing had any seasoning.

I really want to give this place a higher rating..  But I can't 

Do I like the food here?  At times yes, at times no.

What do I mean by that?

Well, the menu is bizarrely based around onions and peppers and I don't understand why..

Order a jerk chicken wrap..  It has peppers and onions.  Order a shombo steak wrap..  It has peppers and onions.  BBQ chicken?  Yep. Basil chicken?  Yep.  

Order a side of rice, and guess what it has in it?  Peppers and onions!

Like come on guys, give me a break on the peppers and onions already.  There are some days I want iceberg lettuce in my wrap, or days where I don't want the all day burps that comes with eating loads of onions.  Or days when I'm hungover, and would love to have a local place to go for wraps, but I want to choose my toppings instead of having them chosen FOR me..  

I have a feeling the owner loves onions and is putting them in everything just assuming everyone else likes them too..  Bad choice

I've tried saying little onions, or less peppers, but they always come the exact same way which has me thinking they are pre mixed

Owner seems like a nice enough guy and all that, but I'm sorry I hate his choice in toppings",1

Red Dragon and Chou's kitchen are two places less than a mile from them I would suggest trying for equally good but different Chinese cuisine.

14436,1,1550880000000,"""Farm Fresh Breakfast?""  How ""fresh"" could a restaurant like Farmer Boys be with a drive-thru that serves food faster to drivers than everyone else dining in? That should've been a sign to turn around, but I'm always down for trying something new.

Ordering inside is disorganized. There's no indication where the line for ordering begins. Basically, you just stand around and read the menu until someone comes by and asks if you're ready to order. After ordering, you're given a number and your food is delivered to your table. Kind of reminds me of eating at Carl's Jr. 

Hot Cakes Combo: I didn't finish my order of eggs, bacon (sausage patties are also an option), and two basic pancakes. My scrambled eggs were the best part. They weren't seasoned, but I prefer them that way. The bacon was greasy and shriveled, and the pancakes....well, they had tiny, mysterious BLUE SPECKS. Yech!

Ham and Cheese Omelette: This was my boyfriend's order. The omelette was hearty with ham, cheese, and diced green bell peppers. Surprisingly, it wasn't bad. Other than that, the toast was horrible, as well as the sausage patties. 

Biscuits and Gravy: To be honest, we weren't sure if this was on their menu when we ordered, but they delivered. So much for biscuits, this was essentially pancakes and gravy, which was seasoned heavily with pepper and had a strong sausage flavor. Not. Good.


There was nothing ""farm fresh"" about the breakfast we had here.",2

We had the house special drunken spare ribs, fish soup noodles with seafood add-ins and a wok fried hor fun. The spare ribs along with chunks of taro were crunchy and tossed in a sweet vinegar sauce. It reminded me of a good sweet-sour chicken dish without the bright red food coloring. The fish soup noodles was a great hit at the table, especially with the add-in options of large shrimp, house-made cuttle fishballs and real scallops. The broth was creamy white with a nice kick of spice at the end. I think the broth was the winner for the day. Also, the little yogurty jello thing comes as dessert on the house. 

We sat on the round stage under the disco ball and lighting track, making the whole table wondering what this place morphs into during the night-time hours. The décor takes a moment to get use to, with the dark intimate lighting, glowing colour-changing lights and a backdrop wall of fish tanks. It's like a traditional chinese tea shop got smashed together with a disco nightclub and had a restaurant as a child. Weird but interesting. Plenty of tables around us were having set lunches complete with lobsters or crab. There were also a couple buffet-style metal bins of soup? stew? that came out to the larger tables.

I no longer wanted to sit behind a computer and hide from the world.  I wanted more.  Today, I attribute my success as a Realtor®, business owner, and human being to the tools I learned in the Landmark programs.  Since I've completed the Landmark Forum I have traveled all over the world (I had never left the country before the Forum), I've raised large sums of money for organizations that make a difference in the world, I have started and operated four businesses, three business networking groups, and I have experienced life in ways I never could have imagined.  Life still occurs as a struggle from time to time but with the tools and training I've received from Landmark I'm never too far from my next breakthrough and victory.  Life is good.

GRILLED OHIO LAMB BURGER
w/ stinky cheese fondue, champagne shallot, olive-dusted pommes frites & tangy yogurt

The bun is a soft and buttery brioche bun (from local Cleveland bakery ""On the Rise""), the meat is good quality and cooked medium rare and the fondue and shallots pretty much put the burger over the edge. It was damn incredible and I could barely put this thing down.

The pomme frites are served in a paper cone and are beautifully cut and seasoned. There are bits of garlic, salt, red pepper, rosemary, and a tiny bit of lavender. There is a yogurt dipping sauce on the side.  

BUTTERED POPCORN POT DE CREME
Caramel & sea salt

I knew that I would enjoy this one. I appreciate hot buttered popcorn, including this classic: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popcorn_(instrumental), buttered popcorn flavoured Jelly Bellys, and a healthy dose of both pop and corniness. As a tangent on this tangent (just call me scatty chatty Natty), one of my best friends is convinced that liking popcorn is a totally female thing. What a little pop psychologist he is with that kernel of wisdom...

Anyway, enough of this poppycock! Back the review.

The gist of the favour profile is smooth caramel corn, salt and butter from movie popcorn and those special half-popped roasted kernels that you hope to find at the bottom of your bag. Bonkers. Unfortunately, I was stupidly full from my meal and barely got to enjoy it, but I can see why patrons won't let the executive pastry chef take this one off of the menu.

In reality however, I had some time to kill in the area before work started so I figured I'd finally make the plunge and try out Zen. To my utter dismay and disappointment, Zen didn't open until 12 (it was around 10:00) so I made the brief trek to Tara Inn after wasting some time in a Shoppers Drug Mart.

Went in and ordered their Irish Breakfast which consisted of 2 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 rashers, 2 small pieces of black pudding, a slice of grilled tomato, a small cup of baked beans, 2 pieces of soda bread, a potato scone, and coffee/tea. 

When I got my plate of food, I proceeded to chow down. While nothing really struck out at me at amazing, it was still a good amount of food given the price (~$9). I found myself using the scone and soda bread to go with everything since they were a nice neutral starch (not too sweet). It wasn't bad. It was a decent, honest unpretentious breakfast. The atmosphere was fairly laidback and relaxing as well. By the end of it, I found myself comfortably full.

My first visit was for the U.S.-England game it was an awesome experience.  Even though the U.S. fans were out numbered a bit we represented.  Besides a couple cheeky remarks everyone got along wonderfully.  

Second visit to C&A was for the the U.S.-Algeria game, and unless you are a hermit we all know what happen that game.  Epicness happened.  When Donovan scored that goal it was absolute bedlam.  It is was one of the greatest moments of my life.  What a great feeling to celebrate something like that with your fellow countrymen and women.  But just like the England game all I had was beer.

It wasn't until recently that I had the food.  I was in the area and decided to give the food a try.  And I'm glad I did.  I had the Fish and chips and they were good.  I'm not really a fish guy, but I thought I would have the house specialty.

Back when actual record stores still existed everything was alphabetized, with cards in between with the artists name. This isn't the only store that I've observed this, however.

When I asked for another Blue Moon they told me they only have Miller and Coors left, which was a hoax because they had more specialty beers but didn't want to dig for them.

To start off, don't expect good service. I gave this place a four star purely because of the food. The service here is like any other all you can eat places across GTA - the servers are always in a hurry regardless of what you are asking the server to do for you. So typically, when I go to any all you can eat places or buffet places, I don't really expect a high level of service. 

The food quality of the sashimi and food in general is so much better than a lot of all you eat places that I have been to. I like how this place has a few items that most all you can eat Japanese places don't have. I really like the steam egg. It was really good. They also have a pretty good list for deserts too. This is the only all you can eat place that I've been that offers steam ginger milk for desert. It was really good - very heavy in the ginger flavor.

The huge living room was barely used and the spare bedroom, murphy bed and second bathroom not used at all. We really wished we had friends or family with us. 

We floated in the lazy river the next day and sunned ourselves for a very pleasant couple of hours. The staff was efficient, helpful and pleasant, as always.

There are a few cons which brought down my rating.   There was no refrigerator or coffee pot in the room.   It was kind of a bummer especially in Vegas.  The bed was comfortable, however, it needed blankets.  Where are all the blankets???   I was super cold that night with the sheets (but I guess I could of called for blankets).   In addition, the bathroom needs just a little upkeep as the wood below the sink area was scuffed and dusty.  Also the tile in the bathroom needed a good scrub down with bleach.  It was kind of moldy. Our bathroom door was warped and chipping pretty bad from the steam in the bathroom.  But mostly the room was just was dusty.  We pulled the night stand out a bit to plug in our cell phones and a ton of dust shifted.   It was dusty dirty not filthy dirty.  I think if the hotel invested in cleaning the rooms thoroughly (moving items and all) and spiffed up the bathroom bit (maybe a coat of paint and deep cleaning the tile) it would step it up.  

I would definitely stay at this hotel again, but will call for blankets ahead of time.",3

It wasn't straight forward enough how the customer was suppose to choose their drink combinations and how things were priced. The instructions on the wall conflicted with what the cashier/mixer later recommended in terms of how much syrup to use. As for pricing, it turned out that you started with an empty cup at $3.25 and everything else you added costed extra. It can get pretty expensive, like $15, for just a simple drink. Note that the petri dishes they use for ingredients were unsealed. Once you've chosen everything they squirt and pour everything together for you. The premium is due to the fact that they have to pay the staff to clean and put everything into syringes and petri dishes... so once you've realized that and get over the gimmick, the traditional bubble tea model wins with the better efficiency, taste, and at half the pricing. Also, they likely forgot to use green tea to make my drink as there wasn't any hint of it in my guava lychee green tea with aloe!",2

I was working with a general contractor to do some major (and some minor) repairs and upgrades in my house.  The contractor did not feel comfortable installing a glass shower door in my bathroom because the walls were not plumb.  He referred me to Rick at M & M glass.  

We were considering getting clear glass, as it is what you see in high-end remodels and it looks elegant.  Fortunately, Rick steered us toward rain glass.  His basic question was, ""do you mind cleaning the glass daily?""  ""If you don't mind, then get the clear glass, if you do mind, then get the rain glass.""  With this wise piece of advice, we ditched the clear glass idea and opted for the rain glass.  It looks elegant, and we don't worry about a little soap or shampoo on the glass because you can't see it from the bathroom.  

The day after my shower door was installed, I was at an open house and I overheard two people griping about the maintenance of clear-glass shower doors.  I can thank Rick for steering me in the right direction.

The shower door looks amazing, fits perfectly, and is leak-free.  What more can you ask for?

We always eat here a la carte, instead of other Korean all you can eat places. The meat quality is high quality. We are always served by Ronnel. He is very friendly and attentive. The only short coming I would say is I called to check if they were open during a holiday weekend.

14771,3,1550016000000,"It is quite OK if you are looking for relatively non-expensive Indian food. I like other Indian restaurants in the area better than Aroma. 

Positives:
The buffet menu is reasonably priced.
The location is excellent, in the ""restaurant row"" on King St W., close to theatres and concert venues. 
They have a food assortment of vegetarian and non-vegeratian dishes, some of them are quite good. 

Negatives: The space is crammed with tables, no space to move, no space to walk; there is only one foot or so between the buffet and the first row of tables. I was not seated at one of the tables next to the buffet, otherwise my review would have been 2 stars... 
The food is not the best, lamb is mostly bones, cheese (paneer) not creamy, naan not fresh, too much mayo in the coleslaw salad.
The staff not very friendly (or too busy), they don't refill dishes half an hour before the buffet closes (even if they take new guests). Nobody asked me if I want something from the bar. 
Only few options for cold starters and deserts. (I am comparing with Kama, which is not far away).
The restaurant looks like a foodcourt, a big room with lots of light and square tables. Not much Indian decor, no booths, no soft chairs. 
It is quite hard to find parking. If you find it will cost you at least $4/hour.

I will probably try the dinner menu one day and update my review.",2
14772,3,1549843200000,"When I went to school at U of I, I came here all the time during lunch to grab a roast beef or ham sandwich on their freshly baked swiss bread. Sometimes I went for the half soup/half sandwich, or half salad/half sandwich to get more variety in my diet. The food here is like comfort food for me, since I grew up in Urbana and my mother used to buy these sandwiches and their large loaves of freshly baked Züpfe for my brothers and me. 

The service at The Bread Company has always been fast and efficient, and the employees were always very cool and made no mistakes taking my order and making me a really good sandwich. 

I've been here a few times for dinner with my friends. The atmosphere totally changes in the evening for dinner, as they lay out white tablecloths, dim the lights and allow the romantic glow of candles set the mood. Their pizza is delicious and filling, and their tapas come in pretty big portions. This is a cute and cozy place for anyone on a date or double date, or out to celebrate a special occasion.

I've ordered take out from them a few times when I've had last minute dinner party pot lucks to attend and didn't have time to cook. One time, I picked up a strawberry walnut mixed green salad, which was perfect, and also a french baguette with a side of baked garlic bulbs drizzled with olive oil. It was worth every dollar.

This place is filled with bed bugs, crack heads, hookers, and plagued by constant break ins. I have personally witnessed all of these things on the property. The only good thing about this place is that some rooms have a balcony which is hard to come by in Vegas. The security (atleast when I stayed there) is shady as fuck.

Angara is on Grand Canyon behind McDonalds, next door to Tropical Smooth and two doors from Bite. 

Buffets is available only during lunch and is only $10.99/person. If you have never had Indian food, this is a very good deal and allows you to try all the popular Indian dishes. In fact, I recommend trying a little bit of everything. The staff at Angara is very helpful. If you wanna know about a dish, they are more than happy to answer your questions.

As you are seated, you are offered two types of naan, plain or garlic. I chose plain as I had to return to the office, and I wanted to be sure I could taste the flavors of the other dishes.

At the beginning of the buffet, they have large sized samosas (my all time favorite, Indian pastry filled with potatoes and peas),  followed by the vegetarian entrees like Saan paneer (my all time favorite Indian vegetarian dish, creamy spinach with cheese cubes),  lentil and eggplant dishes. I'm not a hot/spicy dish person. In the past, I have known saan paneer as a mild dish, but Angara makes it spicy that I had to eat it with the naan instead of the rice. 

Unfortunately, because I filled up on the samosa, vegetarian dishes, rice and naan, the only meat dish I could get to was the chicken tikka. Proof that one can get very full on vegetarian dishes alone. Next time, I'll have to start with the meats. Other meat dishes available were chicken tandoori and goat curry. One dish I wish they had is fried fish bites.

At the end of the buffet were desserts that I'm unfamiliar with, but will try in a future visit, and  regular house salad which baffles me with all the vegetarian dishes available, but to each his/her own.",3

As for the games, they were mostly the same, but included a lot of the newer 'app' style games like flappy bird. Skeeball and Free throw were still fun, along with the coin drop machines.

Sweetbreads
Rabbit Sausage
BobumRhum Cake w Salted Caramel - Heavenly

I had convinced myself that anywhere that would charge less than $45-$50 would result in some disastrous haircut that would leave me crying and confused. But at the same time, I didn't want to leave my wallet empty and I didn't want to wait a week or more for an appointment.

My solution: Great Clips.

I chose the Steelyard location because it's close to me and actually had some decent reviews. After signing in, I waited a total of five minutes before someone was able to cut my hair, which is actually less time than I've waited at places where I had appointments. The girl, Alex, who cut my hair was really sweet, and continued to check in with me throughout the cut to make sure it was what I wanted. It was done in 15 minutes and I walked out with a cut I was really happy with.

If it was this dish alone, I would probably rate it two stars. My husband got the Western Barbecue Burger and overall was ok with it but said the bacon was really rubbery.

Still waiting on the crab that they advertised to be apart of the Father's Day brunch. We are not sure if it crawled under the table. Our drinks came with straws. One straw was dirty so, we requested a new straw. I said to my guest, that how they bring the straw will establish whether this restaurant is a cut above the rest or does it sink to mediocre status.

We ordered the veggie combo and the beef tips-- the tips (about a 1/4 cup) was very dry and flavorless. Along with most of the veggies. And we were charged for our waters.

So no big deal.....then they killed us by saying that even though you are paying for 2 all you can eat you can only get 1 ahi poke salad per table.........my wife and I knowing this to be false asked the sushi chef on duty and he also said that 1 ahi poke per table.

My younger brother is also a sushi chef and I've been eating sushi for 28 years.

We ended up going to Sumo Sushi because we just bought a house in the area, and we decided to give it a try, the restaurant is not big but very cozy, it is run by a married couple and they are very friendly.

When the sushi finally came, the plating was amazing, and when we finally took a bite it was perfect, the rice was body temperature and the fish was fresh. Just like the movie ""jiro dreams of sushi"". We have become regulars at this restaurant, eating there at least once a week and the quality is consistent. 

Their hosomakis has tuna pieces bigger than what you get as sashimi at other restaurants.

Best kept sushi secret in the east end of Montreal!!!

Update: 8/10/2016, been going to SumoSushi for 3 years now -  taste and quality have not changed since, I'm still a happy client, as for the other reviewer, Please read my first line before commenting, Best sushi ""I've had"" in Montreal.

I don't know if they upgraded lunch enough to deserve more stars but the last lunch noted below was pretty bad.
--------------
9-5-17 Edit- I visited recently for lunch and was sorely disappointed. Although I've had pretty good meals for weekend dinners, lunch was pretty bad. The staff all seemed to be daydreaming and wishing they were somewhere else. Two waitresses were braiding each other's hair and the waiter was playing with his phone and the manager was reading by the cash register, but meanwhile nobody was properly running the place. There were a number of dirty plates at the buffet station and a number of empty trays that hadn't been filled for a while. Waitresses didn't come to refill water or take plates away unless you interrupt their hair-braiding and  ask them to come over. I won't go for lunch again, and I'll think twice about dinner if they're going to let their standards slip.

6-7-17 review
I was a fan of the Tokyo Sushi Buffet that was here before, and this place is NOT nearly as good for sushi. I first visited TJ Buffet just after they opened in April. Yuck, I turned around and left after seeing only a couple kinds of lousy looking sushi made with chopped mashed fish.

But TJ's has been steadily improving since then, especially for weekend dinner, so I suggest giving them a chance. They had clams and oysters on the half shell and cold shrimp, all of which were fresh. They had cold mussels too, but they were covered with a yucky slimy sweet sauce. They also had hot roast beef, hot crayfish, hot small clams in black bean sauce that was quite tasty. Chinese style ribs, chicken wings, Oh, and a couple ""genuine"" types of sushi, including tuna, salmon and octopus. Their sushi maker isn't very skilled; the sushi were misshapen and had finger dents, but the fish was pretty good.

All in all it is only about 75% as good as Tokyo Sushi Buffet was, but then again, it's only 75% of the price. I'm also glad to escape the lousy ""christian music"" soundtrack that Hokkaido buffet has been playing lately.",2

When you walk in it usually smells like bacon or panini's or whatever the heck they are cooking up in the cafe. You can sit in the cafe area and get a lemon bar but they also have many other baked goods and sandwiches to choose from.

They have old records and a bunch of old crazy crap in the back that you will love. The kids section has a cute little entry way just for kids and they sell toys, puzzles and games. They also have old vintage action figures from movies and shows. Pretty much any book you could be looking for they probably have which is all categorized so it is easy to find. If you cannot find it though they will be happy to help you in your quest. 

They have a manga section and located just off of the cafe section, they have magazines and comics! I found old Creep comics that were $5 that are really worth $15. They have a porno collection in an armoire but everyone can see you look into it so most guys look awkwardly into it for a minute before walking away. 

Books are reasonably priced and the price can be found penciled in the book on the first page on the upper right hand corner.

Tough steak with absolutely no seasoning.  They didn't sear it before or after the Sous Vide.  They have this beautiful meat freezer with all these Cumbrae meats aging for all to view.  What a disappointment since they butcher (no pun intended) their steaks.

Not just that, but all our dishes were over salted to the point of being inedible.  Clearly someone back there doesn't  understand how much finishing salt to use.  Our beef tartare had so much Fleur de Sel we couldn't eat it.  And trust me, I love beef tartare, so that almost made me cry.

When she returned she asked if I had any problem spots.  I told her but as I found out she never worked on them.  There was never any soothing music put on so the whole time i was getting my massage i could hear all the noise from hair salon, doors closing etc. I felt like i was getting a massage in a gym.  After massage I was told to get dressed which I did but told her I was getting g a facial.  So I was taken to waiting room and then after a few minutes I was taken back for my facial and told to remove my clothes from waist  up.  The facial I got has to be the roughest facial I have ever gotten.  It actually hurt when she was wiping off my make-up or cream she put on.  When checking my skin for pimples she found 2 very small moles I have and thought they were pimples.  She pushed so hard I thought her fingers were going to come through my skin.  Again, I have never had anyone ever do that to my face.  Finally she decided yes they must be small moles.  I still have red marks 4 days later.   Stay away from this place.  I have never had such a terrible experience.  These people need to fly to Vegas or Calif. Hotels  to some spas and see what  a true spa is like",2
15176,2,1550534400000,"I got here 1 minute after 3:00pm -- 1 minute -- and she told me that they don't serve lunch anymore.  So I threatened to leave, thinking full well she would ask me to stay and say ""Okay, I'll let it slide this time..."" but she didn't.  Halfway to my car I realized I was hungry, so I returned and asked if I could look at the menu anyway.

Dammit.

I got the small portion of orange chicken which ended up being about the same price anyway.  Despite the initial annoyance, I found it very tasty and scrumptious (did I just use the word scrumptious?), so I'm bumping my review up to a 4.  Just make sure to get there PLENTY OF TIME before lunch ends at 3.  Jeez.",2

15185,3,1550966400000,"I cannot describe the excitement that I felt when I found such decadent sumibiyaki cooking here in the valley.  I would definitely call this place an eatery.  It is small, cozy, friendly, very japanese-ish, and yet still very metropolitan and hip.  The menu font annoyed the crap out of me (i  know...weird but you'll see what I mean)....but I just LOVED that they had a dedicated section to the sumibiyaki grill dishes.  My favorite of the evening included the following ... respectively... Beef Tongue (it was heaven), whole baby squid, the Kobe version of Chicken (be aware: chicken will never taste the same), the Hoke fish (fish of the day) and the bacon wrapped tomatoes.  Bacon wrapped scallops were WAY over cooked and tasted like chewing on an eraser off a No. 2 pencil.  I'm sure it was an over-sight and I woud give it a try again.  I didnt' get the feel that sushi was the chef's forte, but then again, it's not everyday that you see Aji (Spanish Mackerel) on the sushi menu.  I got the Aji sashimi and was completely blown away and was more than satisfied.  Just like I had remembered from other sushi restaurants, it was rich, yet not fishy at all, flavorful in ways only Aji could be, and of course that recognizable sweet after taste.  *rolling eyes backwards* it was JUST deeeeelicious!!!  The service is also definitely worth yelping about.  Service was insightful, genuine, and real.  You actually get the feeling that they are excited about the food there and they care about the food or tongue you're about t ingest.  :-P  This place has earned a top 3 spot in my book.

Another girl who had been their for 45 minutes complained about no one even helping her and that was her first time their. Another lady and her friend complained that they paid for the $55 dollar pedicure and only got half the time she should have.

- The shower pressure was like a fire hose.
- Hairdryer cord torn and taped with scotch tape... coincidentally it did not work.

The store is very clean and organized.  The shelves are always stocked and item are always available.  Excellent location just off beltline highway.  Easy to get to.  

Many registers always open.  Can get congested at times at registers depending on time of day but normally short wait times at registers.  Also love that they have self checkout registers. 

Prices are very reasonable with excellent quality and super exchange/return policy.  The bathrooms are very clean and maintained.  Above all, the employees are exceptional.  They are helpful, friendly, courteous, helpful, and very knowledgeably...they are great!  Great job Walmart and staff!!!

So upon entering today I was greeted by an employee with a smile and warm hello... A great start. An angry looking gentleman walked by the bar slowly looking around & I asked if he was the manager (to compliment the person up front because as of late service has been RUDE. The response was a curt and rude ""yea"", so I asked ""do you have a quick moment?"" He responds with even more attitude & irritated ""yes."" So at that point of course I say ""never mind you seem like it's a bad time."" He then walked off (muttering under his breath) and proceeded to the back of the restaurant and clearly expressed something about me to the 3 waitresses that were in back. But honestly, there is no reason to go back because this is the type of service he thinks is ok to give paying valued customers.

I am contemplating moving to Las Vegas to live near this restaurant. 
This is definitely a hole in the wall. If you are expecting nice glass plates, fancy food presentation, etc this is not your place. If you want great authentic food for a cheap price than this is your place. I knew I had hit it big when I saw the sweet little grandma in the kitchen cooking up a storm. I got the spicy noodles (YUMMMM) and my husband got the pad thai (YUMMM again). There were only 2 servers and they did such a great job handling the whole restaurant. They were both cordial and prompt. I am so glad we came across this place. Thanks yelpers!!",2

Would have given 5 stars if the pool near room had been heated but was broken and hot tub as well broken as no jets would work and the main pool could have been cleaned more often.

As we walked in we were greeted by an adorable young lady who explained the different options for purchasing game cards for the children to use to play the games.  I'm not sure which ""package"" my husband purchased but it was the perfect amount for keeping the kids happy and busy for a few hours!  I don't remember the last time my kids had this much fun.  After an hour and a half or so we decided to sit down and grab a bite to eat.  The kids each got a cheeseburger and fries and my husband and I shared a couple of flatbread pizzas.  We were VERY impressed with the quality of the food we received.  Our server, I can't remember her name, was an absolute doll.  The food came out quickly and hot.  We will definitely be back to try more of the menu items in the future.  A manager even stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our visit.

15247,3,1550448000000,"I'm only giving it a 4 star because of the relatively high prices. But once that's out of the way, you'll have a good meal there.

The ambiance was good, and service was excellent, but that's what you'd expect from a 5-star hotel. Now, onto the food!

I had the Japanese Breakfast Bento box ($36) the morning I arrived at the MO and it was good, albeit pricey for what was offered. The grilled salmon and shrimp dishes were delicious, as were the mushroom and tofu dish. But be warned! If you hate sour food, don't eat the pickled plum! I made such a face from having it that made the server walk over and ask if there was anything wrong.

Every Sunday, they offer a brunch buffet at $58 per person. Again, if not for the price, it would be 4.5-5 stars. You'll be offered a menu to order your ""main"" brunch entree--I had an Indian curry and my girlfriend had the salmon omelette. The curry was delicious and tasted authentic, and the salmon omelette was delicious as well. You have multiple options for the buffet: a fresh made noodle soup bar, a couple of dim sum dishes, a sushi/sashimi station, and a raw seafood bar with oysters, shrimp, and crab claws, an d of course the dessert station. There are also salads, cured meats and cheeses, and fresh fruits if that's more your thing. The sushi was fresh and delicious (they had salmon, tuna, and yellowtail during my visit), and I had a delicious soba noodle soup at the soup station. The dessert station doesn't disappoint, and the seafood tasted fresh as well. The best part? Your server will bring you freshly made Mochi ice cream at the end of your meal! I'd known earlier so I could've had more!",2

My fiance and I were in Vegas the second week of January when a lot of shows were on vacation, so we decided to give this show a shot.  Afterwards, we questioned why we hadn't seen it sooner.  Perhaps because it's housed at the Imperial Palace, a much older casino & hotel.  

Frank Marino is one gorgeous and funny woman.  The jokes were up to date and hit where it hurt.  Performances were to great hit songs and some costumes have you wondering where certain things fit.  :)  Particularly, Britney Spears in the show would make the real Britney wish she looks half as good.  (Think Britney back in the good ol' day).    

Even though you pick your seats when you purchase the tickets, it doesn't hurt to ask the ushers to see if better seats are available at the time you get seated.  

HI: I thought it was awesome that even though there were signs saying No Photography...Frank Marino was like take pictures, you paid to be here!  A real fun good time!

Upon return, my cavities were prepped by the dentist (with a hygienist intern learning along the way) and then the cavities were filled in by another hygienist (while trainee remained), who was, well, let's just say less than stellar. Then, after getting drilled once, I got drilled again when my bill nearly doubled upon my exit, going from $75 to $131. Next, to top it off I was then sent a bill for the same $131 I just paid.

15276,2,1550361600000,"I recently purchased my 2nd vehicle from Earnhardt Toyota Scion.  The experience at Earnhardt could not have been better, unless maybe they were giving away cars for free!

Our first purchase was 6-8 months ago, we went in on a holiday weekend to ""just look"" but ended up finding the perfect Highlander for my wife.  Ron Wall helped us and he made the experience so easy and enjoyable (we even had our 2 year old with us!).  We were in and out in less than 3 hours with everything done...and that included having a BBQ lunch that they provided!

We were not planning on buying another vehicle so soon, but I was in a car accident with a totaled car so it was time start looking again.  I needed to take our previously purchased car in for some routine service so I figured I should go see Ron and just see what was available.  I didn't end up buying a truck that day since they didn't have exactly what we needed.  We ended up finding a truck at a different dealership, but after signing paperwork on that truck it died on me 2 days later!  Luckily they couldn't honor the deal we signed so we returned the truck and walked away from it. 

After that ordeal we went back to Earnhardt immediately.  We learned our lesson...ONLY deal with Earnhardt, they are the best!  And most importantly to us, we can trust that we are getting a reliable vehicle.  Ron found us the perfect Tundra and once again the process was very easy.  Dieter also helped us that day and he was very easy to work with too!  We all know that car shopping can be a stressful experience, but both times we have bought from Earnhardt it was NOT stressful at all!  We walked out of there with full confidence of our purchases.

As a repeat customer and having been through so much with another dealership I can honestly say I will only work with Earnhardt Toyota Scion.  I've shared the full details with our family and friends and anyone else who will listen to it.  I'm sure a few of them will be in to Earnhardt within the next year.",2

15309,3,1550361600000,"First let me say, I would have given this place a higher rating if it weren't for one staff member. I think his name was Dillon. He was EXTREMELY rude as SOON as we walked in. Fortunately for us, the manager noticed about 15 min into us getting belittled and screamed at for no reason at all, and told him to go take a break. Now I don't want to assume it had anything to do with our skin tone, but let's just say he treated the other customers in a different manner. If the manager hadn't of stepped in, we would've left. I wish I would've gotten the his name to give him kudos for redeeming the situation!

So with that being said, let me backtrack. There was a large group of us, about 10ppl. We all had a Groupon deal so all of us got the two for one deal. Which was great! There were no problems redeeming it.

Things to know beforehand: come dressed for a serious go-kart race. These cars are no joke and a bit intensive to operate. Wear flats, if you don't have the proper shoes, the facility provides you with some sneakers and socks (free).
There is a height requirement. One of our group members is really short and it was kind of funny to see her standing against the poster. 
They have lockers for you to store your personal items. 
They provide head socks, neck braces and the helmets.
They have a great area where you can take pictures, since cell phones are not allowed in the cars. 
They have arcade games for people who aren't participating in the race.
They have massage chairs!

So after checking in, you are required to watch a short training video. Then you grab your helmets and pick a car. 
The track is really curvy, definitely not a kiddie track. The cars are kinda difficult to maneuver, you feel like you've had a workout afterwards! Because it was a large group of us, it makes it really fun. Of course you do bump into a few cars but they weren't sticklers about it. Traction is a bit iffy in some parts, so there are moments when you drift, which in my opinion makes it all the better.
A pretty good amount of time on the track, which is great.
One of the cars however did catch on fire (while still racing)! When we asked the guy how does that happen, he said he wasn't quite sure, it could've been a fuel leak. But we were having so much fun, it was the end of the second race so we didn't make a big deal out of it.

All in all, great fun despite the hiccups, and I'm glad the manager didn't let Dillon ruin our day.",2

Knowing I don't like the club scene I came her me to support a close friends birthday celebration. We had already made arrangements for a table with bottle service for over 12 people. When we came the Vip hostess acted like he never had talked to our friend on the phone shortly before we arrived. We waited outiside in the cold while waiting for them to set up our table. We were brought inside to the table area and seated. They had the ice and juice ready and after brought out the bottles we had selected. We chose ciroc and kettle one to mix our drinks with. The server checked on us frequently and asked if we wanted more drinks as she would come and prepare them for us.

15345,3,1550793600000,"The maintenance staff (past and present) have been amazing. They solved any problems I had quickly and effectively; they always say hi when I would see them in the building. The amenities are nice when you can use them, but when you look at what you pay for them it isn't worth it. Not when there are other apartment complexes all over the city that offer better living experiences. One issue is that they are expected to be the cleaning crew as well, but with the demands of a large building this isn't feasible. MPCA originally had staff dedicated solely to upkeep/cleaning, but I guess Village Green didn't find it necessary anymore (they don't find a lot of things necessary). Secondly, there are no security cameras in/around the building. There were issues with bicycles being stolen from the 'secure' garage as well as some other minor vandalism issues. Unfortunately, there was no way to find out who was committing them because there are no security camera. That's completely unacceptable for a 'luxury' apartment building.  The sales staff misrepresented the building when myself and others were viewing the building (I actually didn't even see the building before move in because the construction was seriously delayed and even impacted my move in date). When asking if there are security cameras they told prospective residents ""they can't say.""  They also talked up the 24 hour concierge service, but this was NEVER a reality. I don't even think the concierge is there 24 hours A WEEK. When VG is questioned about this they say there was never the intention of having a 24 your concierge. If so...then why do all the original tenants recall having the same promise?  Then there are the apartments themselves.  Poor paint jobs (one thin coat), cheap wood used for bathroom doors, and 'hardwood' floors that started to peel up after less than two years of being opened?  Fact is, these apartments won't last. So what's the remedy to that?  Take money from the residents' security deposits for repainting, new carpets, etc. And once you move out...don't expect them to answer any questions you may have. They'll half-heartedly reach out, but you'll never get a legitimate response. Pros:  the location is great, maintenance staff is fantastic, the club room is a nice spot to rent for parties, and if you can snag a spot outside when it's nice out you can have cookouts. Cons:  they don't really care about how the building holds up and they don't care about you once they know they won't be getting any more money from you.",2

15356,3,1549756800000,"This place is a solid 4.5 stars.  I round up for family owned places and down for chains...so they get 5!  The deduction of .5 stars would be for the lack of parking (which I know they can't help) and for a little pet peeve of mine, not listing the market prices.  If you are going to have things on the menu that are at market price, list the prices on the chalk board or have the servers mention them without having to be asked.  

Now to the good stuff.  The oxtail pho was very good.  Large pieces of oxtail that were falling off the bone.  Also, the spicy beef soup was the kind of soup one would love to have on a cold winter night.  We wanted to try the big bone soup, but it was sold out.  The pork belly buns were good, but not great.",3

After looking over the menu and ordering our beverages, two other customers came in and sat near us. About 5-10 minutes later more customers arrived. Our order still had not been taken. We sat while another server tended to customers who arrived after us. Finally our server came and took our order. Our appetizer came out fairly quick and was delicious. Some time later one out of the two meals we ordered came out. After waiting for an extended period of time, and after noticing everyone that arrived AFTER us was getting their food, we asked to speak to a manager. The response we got was shocking. We were told that food is cooked in two separate parts of kitchen. Wait, What? What does that have to do with my meal not being brought out and everyone else getting THEIR food? Then another employee came out to explain ""sorry, the cook is slow"". Wait, your making excuses for bad service? That's just not acceptable. The cook is slow but everyone else that arrived after us got their food??? That's just BAD SERVICE. It's a shame because the food was good. No effort was made to rectify the problem, just excuses. Very disappointing.",2

Good availability for appointment booking, friendly and professional staff, comfortable waiting room, clean. 

I would most likely go back for all of my dental needs except that there is no parking... well, there is but it's a pay lot and it's sometimes full and it isn't cheap.

A young woman with a strong African accent waited on me, and I couldn't understand a word she said. I had her repeat herself several times and then finally told her coworker I can't understand her so he had to tell me. Anyway, After a solid 20 minutes of waiting we finally got our food. I got the chipotle steak sub and was not impressed. Too much cheese and onions and not enough steak. It was very greasy and oily too. I was starving but, couldn't finish it. One nice thing was the guy that rang me up gave me a discount for waiting long but still paid $27 for two subs, a cookie and 2 drinks. Won't be returning to this place.

Easily my worst sushi experience in Las Vegas. The space itself isn't bad with a clean decor and friendly service. The fail all comes with the quality of the sushi and the combinations in the rolls here. Typically when i do AYCE sushi i am 90% nigiri and 10% rolls. After placing my traditional 90/10 order for the first round, the quality made me want to order rolls to cover up the sub par quality of the fish. I found myself not even wanting to eat some of the nigiri but i felt as if i had to as to not get charged extra for it in the end. Second round was more rolls than anything was also a disappointment because there was just so much sauce, a mess of combinations, and flavor that didn't resemble anything delicious. After paying the bill i felt cheated to be honest, as i felt like i was fed something i didn't want and was forced to pay for it. A terrible feeling if you were hoping to go out for a nice dinner.

I stopped at Aldi as it was right near where I was.
The store is on the smaller side but had a pretty good selection and very reasonable pricing.
I bought some cereals and some strawberries and blueberries and a few other items and they were a lot cheaper than a regular supermarket.
The store was clean and the cashier was fast ad friendly.
The place was packed and there was a line, But the cashiers went thru the line rather quickly.
Just a note they do not supply bags sort of like  costco you can buy paper or plastic bags for 7-10 cents or you can bring your own or take shopping items loose.

But maybe I'm being too critical, it is after all a fast food burger chain, thus my 4 star rating when compared to the normal burger fast food chains (McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy's, etc) The option of adding any topping you want still won't cover up the disappointing meat patty.  I've had way better burgers but then again, they were not from a fast food burger chain.

Their saving grace is the fries, thick cut, soft inside with a crunchy exterior skin, They fill it up to the top and then add another half cup to top it off, gimmicky but effective

15421,2,1549324800000,"I have seen a ton of movies at South Point (closest theater to my house). There are pluses and minuses to coming here.
On the plus side:
1. Lots of free parking both in front (closest to the theater if you park on the south end of the outdoor lot). Plus there is a parking structure on the few days of rain in Vegas so you can pared and walk to the theater without getting wet.
2. Stadium seating so you can sit behind the guy who is 6'4"" and not have your view blocked. The aisles are wide enough so that you don't have to stand up every time the guy 2 seats away decides he needs to pee at the most dramatic moment in the film.
3. They have days with reduced rates for seeing films. Plus they participate with Movie Pass so I get in without paying anything for the movie (just the monthly rate for Movie Pass - if you don't know about it, check it out right away).
4. Large concession stand area.
5. Lots of restaurants and food stands to get a bite to eat either before or after a film.
6. Lots of screens so they usually have the latest hot film playing
On the negative side:
1. The movie theater is upstairs in the back, so it's a schlep no matter where you park and come in.
2. They don't have the reclining chairs, just over sized leather. Comfortable but not the latest and greatest in movie house seating.
3. They never play the smaller indie films.",1

Quite a bit I'd say...have they never seen a dog in their life? Would appreciate my money back... Waited 49 mins for 8 wings and frys.

Claims to be done and you still have a pyramid fro and your hair looks nothing like the picture. Balks at you along with other hairdressers because you ask for them to use thinning shears(like every other hairdresser has done that has given me a good haircut), I had to walk her through the entire cut to get what I wanted and I am usually the type that just shows the hairdresser the picture and lets them go at it while I fall asleep in the chair. and just on a side note the older blond hairdresser that balked and then made comments to her client was trying to convince her client (who obviously had a single color done) that the flaming roots was normal.

I really have two choices near where I work, Saucy Bread or George. I'm not gonna diss Saucy cookies, but there's more variety at George and hell, they're a cookie place, it's their specialty therefore they rock! Their brownies on the other hand... I've had better. The Nanaimo bars are good though. 

Location is pretty reasonable, it is definitely at the far end of the mall so if you're just hanging out by Chapter's I wouldn't blame you for not visiting George. As for the price, well making cookies would definitely be cheaper, but if you're like me and you just randomly want a cookie while at Chinook mall, go for it, it's worth it! 

The service at George is also exceptional. I remember one time the guy in front of me and the employee were having this really fun conversation and joking around in a way that made me think they were good friends, and then next thing you know they're introducing themselves to each other.

But I was amazed at how poor the service was. It took almost 45 minutes to purchase a phone because the manager helping us didn't have authority to log in to the main computer. The store was severely understaffed. Several workers had their shirts half tucked in. Their walkies on blast. Workers yelling down aisles. Zero sense of urgency to complete a sale. Our salesperson repeatedly shared that he hated the iPhone (that I was intending to purchase). I could never imagine this conversation at Best Buy. 

I wasn't going to report this ridiculously awful experience because, again, the man helping me meant well. I place 100% of the blame on upper level management not trusting their staff, poor training, not investing in their staff's well being & not passing on authority to put customers first. 

When I purchased my iPhone, I asked that the terms of my data plan not be altered. They assured me several times that it would not. When I got home, I learned that actually they had changed my plan and it took two days of speaking with AT&T to revert back (my plan is amazing and no longer offered). After the unnecessary headache of getting my plan reinstated, I thought it important to leave a review.

Noelle, over several appointments, guided me to building up my muscles and I am now feeling fine and doing almost everything I did before.

Noelle has a friendly, funny but assertive demeanor that really works on a PT patient.  She explains the reason for each exercise and why it will help.  She is very smart and she is always working on additional certifications in physical therapy.

The rye bread is soft, delicious and has a good crust, the meats are plentiful, juicy and piled high, the cheese is tasty.  Its pretty much damn near a perfect sandwich.   My wife always orders the BLT on rye and that always comes out fantastic too.  They must use 10-12 slices of bacon on this monster.

A passion that never could be quenched until you hear the thunderous applause from the crowd at a live performance. I saw this in these performers.

Perhaps the group I was with isn't the right audience for tapas? We all like to eat and none of us felt totally satisfied upon leaving.

Cheese platter - extremely small portion, literally just a few (small) pieces of cheese for $25. 100% not worth the price.

Empanadas - tasted pretty good but you only get two small empanadas for $12! You can get empanadas that taste just as good for much cheaper elsewhere.

I really enjoyed datilles (Dates + Ibérico Bacon + Manchego + Guindillas) - perfect flavor combination.

Paella De Bogavante (Lobster + Gulf Shrimp + Chorizo + Peas) - we ordered the large and thought that they brought out the wrong size at first. Our server made it sound like it would be huge, and the entire table was disappointed at how small the portion was, especially for $75. The flavor was good, but it was so overpriced. We also ordered the small size of another paella and found the size to be pretty laughable.

The bill came to $300+ and while I didn't leave hungry, I certainly didn't feel full after. I have no qualms with spending a lot on a meal, but very few things stood out to me here and I mostly just felt ripped off upon leaving.

My husband and I came here for dinner on a Monday night. The place was very busy for a Monday. We sat at a high top communal type bar table but there were also plenty of private tables. The waitress was incredibly nice and helpful. She recommended a charcuterie board for us and it was phenomenal. It came with little tiny bite size garlic knots that were so tasty. My husband ordered a pizza and liked it very much. It came whole with scissors to cut it which was different. I had the Bronzino and it was good. It didn't come with a vegetable and the waitress asked if I wanted to add one and I declined because I thought it would be too much food after the appetizer. I should have added a vegetable. The Bronzino was good but it's nice to have a side to switch up flavors.",2

Well we returned to Q's Diner with a party of 9.

Here is the break down.

We ordered fried pickles as a appetizer ---- Verdict, Best we have ever had!!!! 

The highlight of the meal was the bacon wrapped meatloaf with fresh homemade mashed potatoes covered in gravy with a side of pinto beans. well what can I say I have found a meatloaf that I like better than the Cheesecake factory . It just rocks!

My wife had the shrimp and grits again and thought it was wonderful.

My friend Brian also had the meatloaf but with collard greens. None was left and he commented that the collard greens was the best he ad ever had.

His wife Paula had chicken pot pie. She said that it tasted great but she wished the sauce had been thicker.

The other members of our party were children, 3 of the 5 had chicken fingers with no complaints.

One of the children had a fried green tomato and lettuces sandwich and loved it. The last child had a vegetable plate.",2

Get here and sit at the bar - waiting and waiting and waiting approx 5 minutes, but none of the bartenders ask what I would like to drink or comes up to introduce them self

A Person sits at seat next to me on the corner and one of the bartenders asks him what he wants to drink and what he has been drinking - bartender makes his beer and comes back with it and hands it to Home, but then leaves and doesn't approach me!

After sitting for little while longer with no interaction from bartenders or being asked what I would like to drink I got up told the guy I've been sitting there and no one has come to me and left - DO NOT go here!!!",2

Tiger Shrimp appetizer is a MUST to try if you like spicy food. I have not tried much else that has been cooked but look forward to our next visit.",2
15589,2,1549152000000,"Pricing is lower than average especially for their portion size.  Their lunch special ($6.99) is till 5pm everyday, which is great for me since I like to eat around 2-4pm  where most lunch specials would end.  Mind you that the lunch special menu is small and not extensive at all, but even at regular price the pricing is competitive.  I usually order their hainanese chicken rice and spring roll.  My friends who come with me usually order their pho, where I take a small bowl & take some of their noodles .  We share food .  I like the pho and hainanese chicken rice and they never disappoint me.  I have had better pho, but this place is still decent especially for the location (it's very close to my house), wait time, convenience, and pricing!  I love their hainanese chicken better than most places (especially for the pricing).  Their service is pretty fast.  You order food and around 5 minutes or so your food is ready.  If ur super hungry and don't want to wait, this is the place for u.  The decor is pretty normal Viet restaurant decor, so not fancy or anything.  This place is good for a quick bite.   It's no Michelin star restaurant but it hits the spot.",2

15608,2,1549238400000,"I made a purchase on their Kenzo collection when it just came out in 2 stores. After my familytried on a sweater we decided that I have to return it. Unfortunately I lost the receipt, it was 3 days after the collection comes out.  I called the store and hoping they can provide some help. The person answered my call immediately told me they won't be able to help me but I can call their customer service department and someone can definitely help me. I called that number and other person asked me to a 1-800 number. I called and I WAITED 51 minutes! Yes waited long and finally someone answered the call and after I explained my situation, he told me he will call the store WITH me and speak to the store manager together. I was put on hold for 15 minutes and the rep accidentally conferenced me on the call when the manager was talking to the rep.  The conversation basically was that they had changed their policy, they used to be more flexible and because the policy was changed for some time they won't accommodate."" I spoke up and then the manager hung up immediately and successfully avoided talking to me. The rep then explain he has no power to override the store manager, the US stores are more flexible.  I am pretty upset at this point and asked then why would the person asked me to call you in the first place!? He then explained they referred me so he can escalate my case but it takes a lot of paperwork and emails. He put me on hold again and came back. Now he tells me my case is not qualify for escalation as it is the Kenzo collection. 

Things I am most upset:

First:  a store manager who can just say no and is policy, it is not exercising and demonstrating any customer service skill or the will for it. And is quite an easy job to do just to say No and is policy. 

Second. They have a manager who cannot take ownership and not even willing to speak to their clients  

Don't waste my time! Lots of time for nothing!! And have me a total runaround. 

No will to help! I suggested I can show them my visa bill and I might be able to get a copy of the recipe from my Bank! They just ignored and never have the will to even think of a solution. The whole goal is to get rid of a problem. 

Very very disappointed that this is the level of customer  experience provided by a world wide brand.",2

Located right on Tryon it is easy to get to AND has outdoor seating (ok it is just two little tables).  The interior is sophisticated with a lot of earth-tones.  The bar is long and cozy.  They always have experts on hand to help you find the perfect selection.  

Food here is phenomenal.  I usually get whatever is on special because the chef knows what he is doing.  They also have custom app plates for meat and cheese if you are just popping in for a bite.  The meat or cheese selections are fantastic and they are generous with their portions.  

Be sure to claim the yelp discount from your smart phone if you check in here!!",3
15637,1,1550016000000,"After living in Thailand for a while and feasting for pennies, it gets painful to pay American prices for Thai cuisine unless it's top notch. Yupha's really hits that notch. The food is authentic except for the spice rating. Mild at Yupha's can be bland compared to the intensity that was considered mild over there. 

The environment is really pleasant and it's one of the few Thai places  where the staff actually indulge my poor Thai language skills with enthusiasm and a smile.",2

it's a pretty standard diner and the food was good.  Visited for lunch and breakfast,
They do a good business so you might wait for a table depending on the time of day.  
Burgers were very good, Reuben and meat loaf sandwich were OK.   Breakfast was good but to be honest I've never been at a diner with bad breakfast.  If I find one I'll be sure to roast it on yelp!  If your right next to it and hungry stop and dine.",2
15649,1,1551312000000,"This Safeway is the closest grocery store to me. However, I basically avoid it unless I absolutely need something last-minute. It doesn't have any specific thing wrong with it, it's just a two-star experience all the way around.

Parking lot is cramped and dimly lit, often with panhandlers or transients simply lounging around.

I don't know if this is a smaller-than-normal location, but I feel like this store's selection is pretty poor, coupled with prices that seem to be on the higher end of local supermarkets.

The checkout lines are consistently long -- all times of day and night. Make no mistake, it is a conscious choice by their management to save money on cashiers. You will not simply run in and run out. 

On the plus side, the store is generally clean and a security guard is present, though I wish there was a second one that stood outside.

Being the only real grocery store near downtown, the customers are truly diverse, making it an interesting place to shop. High-income business commuters, upper-middle-class residents of the surrounding historic neighborhoods, ASU students from the downtown campus, low income families from the eastern neighborhoods, transients stocking up as they make their way up and down 7th, and, more often than not, a homeless person buying a single large can of beer.",2
15654,2,1549411200000,The pizza here is great. I just wish they offered a personal size. My husband loves plain pepperoni. I am more adventurous but had to take one for the team because the pizzas are fairly large and they don't allow you to split the toppings half & half. We ate outside.

It was exactly what I was shown when I got a tour of their show room apartment, which is actually very rare for apartment complexes to actually deliver on. The staff goes above and beyond in every way. Caroline helped me get my lease, and went above and beyond from day one for me. I cannot compliment Caroline enough for the level of customer service she has provided. There was some minor issues when I moved in, which Caroline took care of as soon as I brought it to her attention. 

The maintenance staff is very quick to act, and treated my girlfriend with respect when she was the only one home when they came to fix things. 

The grounds are kept in impeccable condition. The pools are both very nice, with gas grills at both. 

I cannot say enough good things about the management, apartment condition and amenities. If you are looking for a nice apartment, located close to Scottsdale, Tempe, and Phoenix, Arcadia Cove should be at the top of your list.",2

I pointed out it is on their all-day menu, as in every Subway on earth. She summoned the manager, who agreed with the help. I pointed it out on the all-day menu, in bold letters. She turned and stared the menu for a full minute.. That was a long wait. Finally she turned and  explained it's not a foot-long, bur only an omelet...no bread. This was the manager! I should've called her bluff & asked to go ahead and make me an omelet....I'm sure it would have been comical. Instead I told her to forget it, and got myself something at the Chipotle Grill nearby. I think this Subway has a training problem!.",2

Fortunately, this bakery was right next door (it didn't hurt that their lineup was significantly smaller).

This is a pretty small bakery, but they had quite a bit of variety. I ordered a chocolate croissant to tide me over, as well as a loaf of chocolate cranberry bread for later. I was not disappointed.

The croissant was nice and light and flaky, with a chocolate stick in the middle (which seems to be pretty typical for chocolate croissants). As for the chocolate cranberry loaf....wow. It was absolutely delicious on it's own, but even more so after being toasted and lightly buttered. So good!

I will definitely be back here.",2

The first bar tender ignored her when we went to the bar to order then the rest of the staffed gathered at the end of the bar watching and talking about her. One of the employees, I think a manager, came up to me, the only white person in the group, and told me we needed to quiet down. We were not being overly loud, or disruptive. They then told my friend we needed to leave and kicked her out. I went back in and to ask for clarification, but was told if I didn't leave immediately the police would be called. This place and their behavior is disgusting. I will never return.",3

15680,2,1551225600000,"Well I'm always up for giving a restaurant a second chance. Everybody's entitled to have a bad day at the office. I came in this time for dinner service and chose a table instead of the bar. I figured I'll order a steak I mean seriously who can screw up a steak?  Top sirloin with an upgrade to Caesar salad and some shrimp. Looks good on the menu. This is arrived and tasted good if slightly overdressed. Then the main course arrived, well I guess milestones can still screw up a steak. I ordered rare, and the waiter confirmed with me that I wanted rare, weird. When it arrived the toppings were cold and the steak wasn't even close to where in fact I would put it past medium on its way to dead. I put my guard down and waited for the follow up so I can get it corrected. The follow up never happened, after 10 minutes I had to start waving to get my waiters attention. After showing him the carnage there was no question that a refine or was required. When the replacement meal arrived the guy who delivered it waited to ensure that it was prepared properly. My waiter showed up much later when the plate was almost empty to follow up. I was offered the standard issue dessert or additional salad which was weird because I'd already have a salad, clearly management believes in cookie-cutter service. The waiter then followed up 10 minutes later offering me desert again. Apparently saying ""I don't eat dessert"" the first time was not convincing enough for him. I don't blame the waiter, it was a busy night, I blame management tip to tail. When you show up twice and get the same crappy quality control and lackluster service you know management is an issue. Now that cactus club is in Ontario they are going to kill these guys just like they did in BC.",1
15683,1,1551312000000,"I'm in town visiting my parents and needed to get my nails done. I found Nail Star on yelp and it had the best reviews. This place is just as great as everyone says. The people that work there are friendly and they do a great job on nails. It's very clean, they use liners in the pedicure tubs and they open a new pack of sterilized nail tools for each client. Don't forget to get a punch card if you're a local. I'm very happy with my nails, I'll be back.

UPDATE: I went back to this salon and although everyone is really nice, I have to take away one star. The person I got the first time did an excellent job but the second time the guy was constantly pausing to answer the phone and take payments. He seemed really distracted. While he was cutting my cuticles he was hardly paying attention, I was scared I was going to get cut. The constant stops really disrupts the service and it's really gross to take a cash payment with the gloves on and then return to cutting my nails. Cash is easily one of the dirtiest things out there. The first guy also gave a decent leg massage while with the second one it felt like he was just rubbing the lotion around. He also shook the nail polish bottle which produces small tiny bubbles reflected in the paint job. They should roll it back and forth between their hands in order to move the polish around without creating those annoying bubbles. If you get a good person, remember their name and be sure to request them each time, or your next time in could be less than a 5 star experience.",2

15688,3,1550966400000,"Ahhhhhh I am not sure where to start with this hotel. I stayed for my 21st birthday and wanted to stay in a gorgeous room with great amentities but not pay $3,000. I had the studio suite and I was NOT let down. The room was600 square feet, there was a HUGE jetted tub, walk in shower with a rainfall waterhead with beautiful marble details. The room had not one, but two plasma tvs, THREE closets, and storage below both of the tvs. The bed was ridiculously comfortable as well. 

Now, the staff. I can be a little demanding at times I think, but I just love things to be perfect. The staff helped me 24 hours around the clock. Room service was on time, housekeeping kept the room looking great, and when I discovered that a handle was broken on the fridge, maintenance came up and fixed it no problem. 

I cannot say enough good things about The Palms Place. From the moment you enter the lobby, you feel as though you are being catered to. I already booked the same suite for labor day! The price really doesn't get any better, and the rooms are perfection.",1

The booking process was extremely easy via email and there was no problem with adding more people to our group, even last minute.  In the end, we had nine women and two girls for hair and seven for makeup (and a surprise touch up for the groom's hair) and, everyone was finished in plenty of time.  The stylists and artists were efficient, professional, personable, patient and demonstrated a passion to make us all beautiful.  We were all 100% happy with our final looks.  I would recommend this company to anyone who needs their hair and/or makeup done for any occasion.  

My one piece of advice though is:  be ready to show pictures of your desired look to the stylists as they will ask for them and will be hesitant to style your hair without examples.  I believe this is because one person's vision isn't necessarily another's.  The stylist and artist took my ideas and completed my look beyond expectations.  I was a pretty hot bride! ;)

Quick service, good quality, and great prices make it a real good place to go.

I've had their Quesadillas, Chicken sandwiches, BLTs, french fries, and Fried Bologna.  I highly recommend it during lunch for a quick bite since their kitchen is on point with getting you well prepared hot food in a jiffy before you have to go back to work.

  I've only complimented the space, but now with the soon to be opened new exhibits that add to an already impressive art collection - tremendous.  

  Lets not forgot about one of the key ingredients to making a great attraction become must see again and again, the facility is very user friendly with a excellent food court that makes specialty items like no other.  Now I don't want to hear you bay Sayers who are going to complain that the food is all over priced by one or two bucks- please- you just got  into a top notch institution for free- expect to pay a bit more, but the food is really worth it.

I stayed here for three nights for business.  Mind you this is the first W I've ever stayed in so I didn't know what to expect. 

Decor in the lobby and common areas were pretty nice.  Suitable I suppose for the desert location.  

Room decor: totally different story.  I hated the muted colors and the retro style furnishings.  It just didn't feel welcoming.  I was lucky enough to have scored a corner suite overlooking the pool area, so that meant I had my own balcony and a pretty large room with a separate bathroom area.  But my coworkers had the ""regular"" rooms and wow.  TINY.  My review here may not have been as kind if I'd gotten stuck in one of those.  The one thing I hated the most was the placement of the bed.  It was awkwardly placed in the middle of the room (as in not against a wall) and worse yet the outside door/entrance was behind the headboard (bad feng shui if you're a believer)!  Hated that so much I flipped the sheets and slept sideways on the bed (yes, I'm short enough).

PROS:
- great staff: professional and very courteous
- nice square footage but only if you get a corner suite
- fluffy bathrobes!!!  YESSSSSSSSS!!! Oh and a bonus: spa-style slippers to wear in your room
- Bose 5 channel speaker system
- 2 LCD TVs in room

CONS:
- square footage of the regular rooms
- layout of the furniture
- room decor and colors

All in all, the hotel's saving grace in my perspective was the obvious thought placed in the amenities (when travelling, it's often the little things that count!): Bliss branded bath items, the fluffy bathrobe and slippers, the staff ... hence the four stars.  

If decor, feng shui, and color schemes don't trouble you, 5 stars.",2

We went to the dealer looking for a Panamera. We had another trade in for them to look at. We found a silver Panamera that we liked and the salesman ( not named to protect the guilty) said he would give us a great deal. We probably should have walked out then when he said that. I gave him the vin# for the trade in and he then put everything into the computer. After about 10 minutes of plugging everything in he then left to supposedly talk to his manager to ""give us a great deal."" After another 10 minutes he came back with a lowball trade in number which he claimed was from KBB,  and also virtually nothing off the Panamera...he previously said that they wanted to move the car and it would show in the numbers he was going to give me. I then gave him my printed copy of the KBB  dealer trade in value which was $10,000 higher than his trade in number. He must have sized us up and thought we were stupid. We then left. The next day I called my old dealership and one more on an identical Panamera, and not only received the KBB trade in value, but also $8,000 off the new Panamera. It was pretty obvious that Gaudin was just trying to pick us off. Needless to say we will never go back even for servicing on our cars.",2

15830,1,1549670400000,"After returning from holiday to discover my apartment had bed bugs as most people I was horrified. I'd had them once before about 3 years ago & had an absolutely terrible experience with a local exterminator & wound up doing all the work myself plus shelling out nearly a thousand dollars. After reading about Anthony on Yelp I was eager to get his opinion. He came over and I was immediately put at ease by his kind, non-judgmental & empathic demeanor. He delicately & carefully inspected my entire apartment, turning over all furniture & peeling over my bed. He confirmed I did have a mild case of bed bugs & showed me the evidence. I was initially leaning towards heat just because of my bad experience with chemicals but he carefully described in detail why this would be more cost efficient & best suited to my needs. He did not try to sell me anything & was both an excellent listener & communicator. He came & did my place, even taking the time to carry all the bags I'd mistakenly left outside. I left him a key which he promptly delivered to me at my job for my convenience. He was patient & accommodating with my method of payment and answered all my questions in great detail. I would HIGHLY recommend Anthony to anyone suffering this horrible infestation!! I am so glad I found him on here & if I ever have issues he will be the first I contact. So far I'm fairly confident my bug issue is remedied & to that I owe him all my thanks & gratitude!",2
15835,1,1550707200000,"Is it just me or are uptown AYCE sushi places much better than downtown ones? There are more dishes to select from and everything we ordered were pretty good. We went as a group of 8 people for lunch and we ordered a lot so it was difficult to keep track of everything I tried. I do remember their beef skewers and tenderloin pieces were really good. The black dragon roll had a nice smoky flavor, and the deep-fried squid tentacles were very meaty and cooked just right. The nigiri sushi and ice-cream were pretty standard, no complaints though. 

I read some of the negative reviews on the service and how the servers were not the happiest people in the world. I kind of felt that but they tended to all our requests even when we called them over multiple times to make small orders each time and they didn't make any mistakes with our orders. 

Overall, since it was my first time going and don't really have a comparison with how much better they were in the past, I would say this place still beats out most AYCE sushi places downtown Toronto and I'd go back again if I was in the neighbourhood.",2

Don't be swayed by the name... Its a man's bar....  no, no stripper pole!  I wasn't sure what to expect, when I walked in, but when I was greeted by the familiar face of Tom, the bartender ( His abilities are legendary from Padlock and Friends) I knew I was gonna be quite happy! 

Prior to being baptized ""Cherry Bar"" ... the place was most recently named ""Friends""... it had a great staff and location, but lacked an identity. I understand that changes are underway, and a lot can be expected in the future from the new owners, including a completed outdoor patio area and interior remodel. Personally, I'm happy to see their Men's bathroom is modern, clean and well lit. ( unlike another nameless bar on 7th Street just North of Missouri ..YUK !!!) 

They also have some awesome drink specials going on.. I was there on a Thursday night... and it was 2-4-1... other specials are Mojito Mondays $4.00 until 11...with karaoke starting at 9! and $5.00 well Martinis on Wednesday! And Every night is 2-4-1 from 11PM until close!

The lady who did my eyebrows and arms told me to sit/lie down while she was on her phone for a good minute, and in the middle of waxing my arm, she goes on her phone, checks it and charges it. Very unprofessional. She was a nice lady, but asked too many questions about me and my personal life. I just came here to get 2 things done and leave. 

Eyebrows: she didn't really do much... She just took most of the hairs out and left some very noticeable/long hairs. I could've done this at home.

Arms: She made sure she didn't leave any hairs behind on my arms. She didn't cleanse them she just put a ton of oil on my sticky arms and i had to go out like that after",2

My friend was drinking the same and he couldn't drink his either (neither of us are fussy btw) when I told the bar tender it was flat she had an attitude and told me that she wasn't taking it back as I took a drink of it now. And if I could tell it was flat by looking at it I should of said so straight away. 

We decided to stay despite this and moved away from the bar to a table. On one of the busiest days of the year they had a young girl training in there. Who wouldn't give us jäger shots as she wasn't comfortable serving us while we had a beer (we had 2 drinks in us at this stage) so we had to wait to finish our beers to get our shots.

Said soup was quite garlicky in a light clear chicken broth, with too few noodles to be called ramen.  It came with rice, which I dumped in along with a few scoops of the fluffy sizzling egg soufflé. The beef was cooked well, tender and not dry.

Service was very friendly, though my water did go unfilled for a bit.  The portions were huge!

It's an excellent choice for a neighborhood Korean place.  I would go back.",2
15870,2,1549670400000,"Prices can be a bit stiff, but they make up for the food.  Fresh corn tortillas, salty yummy cheese and their beans and salsas are spicy and tasty, that is why I go.  The meat is normally a little overpriced so I will only get it if I see a sale going on.  I've also had the carnitas which was a little dry and fatty, but it did it's job when I had to feed people on a quickie.  Their meat is extensive in options including chicken.

They will sometimes have tamales, which I didn't enjoy because they add veggies and not enough meat, so I had a lot of masa on the order I bought. 

This carniceria is located in a little strip mall northeast of Southern & 48th street.  They also have a few bakery options and not that long ago added snow cone options.",2
15872,3,1550793600000,"Love it.  MAD Greens is one of the few restaurants where I walk out feeling refreshed and energized instead of thinking that I need to find a dark area where I can take a food coma nap.  The service is friendly, the owners have an awesome genuine mission, and the prices are fair for the quality that you get.  Even the fountain sodas taste bubbly and light.  My favorite salads are the Edgar Allan Poe (steak and blue cheese) and the Don Quixote... oh, the Don Quixote.  I usually am not a fan of chicken in salad, but the chicken here is so tasty.  It's juicy, soft, and obviously slow roasted - there's none of that blobby rubbery fat that fast food restaurant salads have.  Pairing that with avocado, that salad is definitely my favorite.

Definitely recommend stopping by, especially if you want to feel alert and ready to go for a hike after eating instead of groggy.",1
15873,3,1549756800000,"So I was here on Tuesday to get fitted for new bras. It's been a long time since I've had a regular bra & not a nursing bra, as I've been pregnant and/or nursing my 3 boys since 2011. 3 under 4... Anyway, I've also been working out and losing weight and I was in desperate need of some good fitting bras that weren't nursing bras, now that that chapter of my life is finished. :) 

Lola helped me first off and did a quick measurement and filled out a card with types of bras I was interested in and sent me to the dressing room where I was assisted by Ashley. She took the card and brought me those kinds of bras to try out and I just had to push a button when I was ready to try on more or different styles. Very cool! I was really excited too because my nursing bras were 40-42 E and now I'm a 34dd! Huge change! So it's amazing to have some new bras that fit wonderfully.

I got a strapless/multiway bra, a daily no underwire bra which is super comfortable and two sexy unlined lace bras and matching panties for all of them. :)

The customer service was amazing and they made it so easy for me as I was really dreading shopping for new bras. I even had my 1 year old with me and he did great while I was trying bras on. Overall a great experience and their bras are worth the money, especially with the type of customer service you get. :) highly recommend them!",2

The manager came to our table when we were about to leave asking us how everything was and since it was our first time she handed us an envelope that had a 10 dollar certificate for the next time we came I thought that was a very nice gesture.

15945,1,1550448000000,"Went for a birthday in February of 2016. 

1) The food was really enjoyable. I got to try about 7 different dishes and they were all between pretty good and great.
2) Oddly disproportionate portion sizes. Obviously part of this is based on the relative price ingredients used, but most of the group seemed to find it hard to know how much to order. Some couples ordered 3 dishes and were stuffed, others ordered 4 and were barely full.
3) Slightly pricey but I enjoyed the food, and it's just the norm in trendy parts of Toronto.
4) The service was quite slow, and the two staff members we interacted with most were not agreeable at all. One was generally snippy and one smiled at the table an visibly switched to a scowl the moment he turned away (on one occasion he seemed to be muttering something, but I couldn't hear it...) Bad days happen but this was excessive; none of the servers seemed to be enjoying the work at all.

In all fairness, it sucks to serve a table of 12, so I'll probably go back as a table of 2 or 4 to give the restaurant a shot. If the service is the same I won't go back because the quality of the food doesn't make up for the attitude we dealt with. Fingers are crossed that's not the case though.",2

Now my hair is permanently soft and wonderful.

 I did not get a massage here but my roommate said he was impressed with is reflexology massage, that the therapist worked his legs and feet very thoroughly getting all the areas of tension.

Literally, everywhere, I got lost in this place.  There are several rooms with things for sale on walls, floors, piles anyway you can imagine.

OWNERS im in very nice black shorts with a long sleeve button up dress shirt with very nice shoes.  That should be good enough.  My recommendation without being inside is this place is very pretentious and even though we signed up to be members we won't be back.  A new restaurant concept opens you have 1 chance to make a great impression and even before we got in the front door its not good at all.  My recommendation is, go somewhere else there are plentyyyyy of options in this town that have much better customer service.",1

First thing Lynn asks me is why I'm not getting gel polish, and I felt berated to choose gel polish instead of regular. Ended up getting gel polish, uneven acrylics. Some nails are really thick and others are thin. Some are different shapes than the others (I got coffin shaped acrylics). Morning after getting my nails done I woke up to one of them already popped off- went in the next day to get it fixed and I had to pay $3 for a broken nail that I had gotten done the day before. Me being a cosmetologist and knowing a little bit about nails- when one pops off without it hurting at all, the application was done poorly. And after having them done for less than a week I've had 3 nails pop off now. Very disappointed with this place considering I paid $81 (including tip) for a full set and basic pedicure and results were below subpar. Won't be returning.",2
16019,2,1551225600000,It was an average hotel casino. Some paint was peeling off the walls in our room. The beds were ok didn't like the pillows. Buffet was average among buffets. Not a huge selection. Should have tried the small restaurant next to the buffet. The pool area was nice the jacuzzi was nice but no jets were working. The way the rooms were set up was kind of maze like. It was just an average place close to the strip. Oh yeah we arrived around 1pm and couldn't check in until 3 close to 4 pm.,3
16023,2,1550793600000,"This pizza is definitely unusual. First off, it's square! Not a rectangle either. Square! It has a satisfyingly crunchy bottom crust, that justified the name crisp pizza. The dough is light and airy. It is closest to a sicilian crust, but not as thick. The sauce has a more fresh ""raw"" flavor than a traditional NY style pie. They finish every pie with fresh basil leaves and a squirt of extra virgin olive oil. A very cool touch.

I tried to order a small pie with half meatball, half mushroom. They said they could only do half and half on large pies. That confused me. I was taught that in the restaurant business, there is always a path to saying yes. And doing a half and half pie is such a normal thing in a pizzeria, I was momentarily stumped.

When I said that for the right price anything in a restaurant should be doable, they replied that the register wasn't set up for it. In the end they find a way to ring it up. $18 and change. To the owner: add a half and half small pizza option to your register please. It's definitely doable! Even if there is a small upcharge for the extra labor. 

The mushrooms weren't special at all. I've had some fantastic mushrooms at other joints. The sauce dominated any flavor they might have had, but eating one solo didn't impress.

But the Meatballs! Oh yes! I struggle to find a good new york style meatball anywhere in Arizona. But these nailed it! NY style pizza meatballs are not crumbled beef. They aren't balls or half balls of meat. They aren't small. They are supposed to be flat disks, like large pepperoni. And you should see herbs or garlic in every delicious slice. Crisp's meatballs hit the mark! In the photo, you can clearly see the delicious garlic sparkling in every one.

I liked the music and the cool garage-door store-front. The tables are communal style. They are only open till ten on the weekends, so there won't be any after bar socializing at those tables.",2

16044,3,1549756800000,"I wanted a casual dining experience while at Encore or Wynn and was debating between Jardin and Tableau. But once I saw photos of the Maine Lobster Benedict, I knew I had to go to Jardin. 

It's located in the beginning of the Encore Esplanade, right across from Hermes. It's a beautiful restaurant with tons of colorful flowers. If you sit outside, you overlook the pool area. 

I don't like ending conversations on a negative note so I'm not doing that with this review. The food was marvelous and I'll get into that soon. But the service was very lacking which was surprising to me for a luxury resort hotel. I had had wonderful service so far during my stay that I was disheartened to experience less than great service from Jardin. I was told afterward from my husband that he had made a special request TWICE (from the hostess who sat us down and to the maitre'd himself) for our anniversary. Unfortunately, that request was never fulfilled and even when he had approached them afterward, they did not make any offer of amends. 

We had three different servers. One had been moved indoors and so we had a second server. Then it got too cold outside and once we were moved inside, we had our third server. Of the three, our second server, Megan, was the most attentive. We were not checked on often by any of the other two which was a sad shame. 

But on a better note, our lunch was fabulous. I ordered the avocado toast as an appetizer and it seems pricey at $16 but it comes with three triangular toasts that are heaped on with fresh avocado, black garlic humus, pomegranate seeds, lettuce and grape tomatoes. It was delicious. 

We both ordered the Maine Lobster Benedict and it was the best Benedict I've ever had. $24 but very much worth it in my opinion. Two English muffins with large pieces of lobster on each and an excellently poached egg on top of each. In the middle was a rectangular hash brown that was a great compliment to the dish. It was very crispy and buttery. I loved this dish and highly recommend it if you're able to have lobster and don't mind the higher price. 

I also had the Orange Lavender Mule which was delicious! Loved it so much, Megan gave me the recipe from the bar.  It was so refreshing and delightful. I also had an English breakfast with milk. They serve Forte teas on the Wynn property which is nice. 

Overall, the food we had was marvelous. Maybe we just had sheer bad luck with regards to the service during this visit and hopefully it'll improve. If you want Maine Lobster for breakfast though, come here.",2

16091,3,1548979200000,"I have been sent on a quest for Dim Sum.  This is Serious Business.

I'm wearing my travel digs:  White t-shirt, gray unstructured sport coat, black pleated slacks.  Oakley Crosshair 2.0 wraparounds complete the look, which is somewhere between polished and menacing.  Gradually my relative size to the people around me starts to increase as I walk past hair salons that reek of ""the Greener grass"" effect, herbal dispensaries that have linked cancer to sexual power and cured both with dried ground endangered species.  Gradually I'm a full foot and change taller than almost everyone around me, and one of a very few non-oriental race members.  I narrow my eyes behind my sunglasses, and the sea parts long enough for me to get a number in reply to my ""one, for lunch"" request.

  Time passes.  My number is called and It's time to dine.  I'm seated near the glass wall by the menu, and for a brief delusional moment I think this means the carts will not make it to me in a timely fashion.

  The carts start arriving being shoved by Chinese women who equate the turn of my head with a leaping embrace, a bellow of joy, and a hissing demand for a slightly larger portion than normal while my fingers grip their hair tightly.  After five fast dishes I am literally terrified to move, but I'm managing to smile and shake my head ""no"" which seem to tell them to ""invoke the hurt sobbing of a spurned lover and plead piteously.""  Two more plates arrive in this manner, and I realize how alone I am just now.  While I am no virgin, there's only so much that will fit.

  As for the food -- at some point I'm pretty sure dim sum offerings are sent out just to mess with you.  It starts normally enough, with known offerings and expected pleasures.  ""Shrimp dumplingShuMaiYouWantYes?""  Soon, however ""CatKidneyPoachedSquidInkYes?"" Umm... ""CrispyPorkMarinated-"" so far so good ""UterusWithGarlicYes?"" *Wince, ponder* ""Bring It.""  Eyes glance over and money exchanges hands, and the next round of betting on what will the gwai-low eat next begins.  There's an old Chinese woman grinning like I just won her rent money, so the last couple of dishes (what am I up to.. eight?) I take her advice.  She winds up laughing with me and we split the last dish of whole fried prawns, which we eat heads, tails and all.  Without being able to speak to eat other we have tea as annoying children pound on the glass wall we're both seated against -- at one moment we communicate clearly, however.  The child's antics crescendo, and we both fix the beastie with Death Glares.  He looks at both of us, pales, and runs to his mother's terrified arms.  The old woman and I meet eyes, and I think ""dead before he hits the ground"" and she answers ""and then prepared in the classic manner with fermented bean paste, garlic, hot chili oil and scallions.""  

  Thin smiles, and then it's time to go.  I will miss Montreal, and especially this restaurant.",2

The flavor we chose was birthday cake with chocolate fudge topping. There were only two people in front of us. We waited 15 minutes for ice cream. The price and the wait would be fine if either were worth it. 

The ice cream was very smooth but the flavor was bland and artificial. We ended up throwing it away after a couple of bites. We went to Zoyo and paid $7.50 for two cups with toppings that was far better.",3

I recommend the padt thai here, it is really good with chicken. Stay away from the soups, they are too bland. Their house special thai style crispy chicken is very tasty and works well with spices.

We had a nice table off to the side with a partial view of the fountains.  Since it was my first time at the restaurant my friend let me have the chair with the view.  We decided to share our plates.
1.  Steak Tartare:  This was the main reason why I came.  It was magical.  The punch of flavors was amazing.  You pick up different flavors all over your palette.  
2.  Crab Cake:  The subtle flavor of the crab was allowed to shine.  The spice was just right to add to and not take away from the crab.  
3.  Beat and Goat Cheese Salad:  This was the only item all night that I liked, but wasn't blown away by.  The quinoa and pumpkins seeds were not my favorite.
4.  Peppercorn Rib Eye:  We both loved the Rib Eye, but we agreed that the next time we come we would opt to get something else.  We felt the peppercorn wasn't needed on such amazing cuts of steak.  
5.  Veal Chop:  Best veal I have ver had.  The meat was perfectly cooked and juicy.  The meat was outstanding on its own.  It didn't really need the rich sauce that accompanied the meat.  
6.  Cream Spinach:  Excellent
7.  Truffle Potato Gnocchi:  Flavor overload!  Incredibly reach and decadent.  
We skipped dessert and opted to have a cappuccino instead.  We ended speaking with a lovely group of ladies at the next table visiting from England and we joined them for coffee.  
One thing that I LOVED about this experience - we were not rushed.  We arrived at 9 PM and left the restaurant at 1:20 AM.  We were able to savor every bite and enjoy our company over an amazing meal.

Started eating and realized there was no soy sauce/wasabi/ginger - if you ask though, they will generously bring these things out for you. The sad part is that the restaurant wasn't even that busy.. Today's experience was so bad that I don't ever want to come back here.

Mashed Potatoes with Boursin cheese. 5 stars. $8
Bananas Foster - Prepared and flamed table-side. 5 stars. $7 (yes, it was only $7)
Whiskey Sour with Jack Daniels - $9
Cosmo $10

Their pricing here is very reasonable compared to other places. And it was nice to see most of their guests like to dress up for dinner. One lady we noticed wore a classic black cocktail dress with a Mary Tyler Moore/Dick Van Dyke show hairdo. She could have been on the cover of a magazine from the 60's. 

Our server was Teodoro who was supported by a nice lady whose name we didn't get. Great team. Timing was spot on.

Craig is a classy guy who has been in the business for a long time. He knows how to take care of people. When not too busy, he'll share some of his experiences with you.

Everything looked great on the menu. Nothing looked boring and ""plain old mexican"" at all.

Their house salsa is SUPER yummo. Definitely homemade. Lots of fresh ingredients.

Serving sizes were too big, especially for lunch. It looks like they have the same menu for lunch and dinner (although I didn't ask). 3 enchiladas are too many at lunch time, because those chips are filling! So we split an order of the green chili enchiladas and (she had 2) I got a carne asada taco.

Everything arrived elegantly plated. The marrow was rich and savoury with nice zest/herb aromatics, perfect atop of the toasted slices of bread they came with; I only wish it came with more. For the amatriciana: the spaghetti noodles had a substantial and pleasant bite to it, and the sauce was a lovely balance of the tartness of the tomato against the guanciale---personally I would've liked a little more heat from the chili but it was very enjoyable nonetheless.

Atmosphere - Open layout and open kitchen, but the noise level is not too loud. Very comfortable.

Service - It wasn't too busy when we started so we received attention but I felt rushed. I realize that the kitchen wasn't busy but the app dishes were barely up when the main plates were down. 

Food - One main dish was a fail but otherwise the food was excellent. Deviled Egg of the Day - Wow, what a pleasant surprise. I can't even remember how it was prepped other than the smoked cashews but what a innovative way to start the meal. In the future I'll try whatever the DED is. Shrimp, Sausage & Grits appetizer - Another great dish to start. The serving size is perfect to get the great flavors in the dish. The shrimp was buttery and not over cooked. The sausage was sliced thin and had great flavor but not spicy. The grits were the creamiest I've had and the jus that was added was rich. Port Osso Bucco - A dish I'd go back for. The pork was moist and flavorful. The spaetzle was great and had a crunch to it, assuming from the carrot. Fork Tender Short Ribs - This was the fail, and for a signature dish it was even more disappointing. The ribs were either too lean or overcooked & held too long, but the sauce they put over the top wasn't enough to keep them from being dry. The mashed potatoes were bland. Dessert - The Chocolate Dipped Bacon Smores was a deconstructed smore with each item having great flavor but difficult to eat. I wouldn't go back to this one.

We probably ordered too much but there was so much to try. Our waiter was really nice and attentive and didn't rush us at all even though it was getting late (we could only get a reservation on a Sunday night at 8pm and we were late because of a Penguins game). I think the negatives are that it's really dark, like hard to read the menu so dark and very loud, so a little hard to talk. But I would go back in a heart beat if we can get a reservation.",2
16196,2,1549756800000,"DO NOT GO - RUDE, unprofessional,  tacky environment, overpriced and slow as hell. They advertise for a Groupon and then charge you when you get there then you get to call Groupon to get your money back because you just paid twice. They make you wait an hour past your appointment time. Do not go to this business if there was such a thing as Dirty Dining for nail salons this would be it. If I could rate it  -1 * I would!!
Extremely worthless business!",2

Ordered mutton biriyani, and Andhra chicken curry.
The biriyani was authentic and flavorful. I especially liked the kata gravy they gave along with the biriyani.
The chicken curry was spot on.

The prices are reasonable and even the food quantity was good.

16212,1,1549670400000,"I'm giving three stars because I had the lackluster lunch special.  I always believe the regular menu items are better than any specials offered.  I had the lunch special with deviled eggs, hand cut fries, and the pulled rotisserie chicken.  As soon as I told the server what I wanted she came back with my food in less than five minutes.  My fries are ""sitting under a warmer"" warm, not fresh out the cooker warm,  the deviled eggs.... everybody shouldn't do deviled eggs, and the pulled chicken didn't have that juiciness that rotisserie chicken usually has.  It was a decent lunch for the price, but quite underwhelming given my expectations based on what the place looked like and the pictures I saw here on Yelp.  Maybe one day I'll give them another chance for their dinner service.",2

16225,1,1549497600000,"This is the newest TJS location in the Valley and while none of them are really THAT close to our house, we do come here for a few specific items.

If you're familiar with the Amy's line of frozen entrees, we love the cheese enchiladas, but at $3.79 for one box, they can get pretty pricey. TJS has a very comparable one for $1.99, and since it doesn't have the cardboard box, it's less waste too!

Another frozen item we love are the chicken lemongrass sticks. Similar to mini egg rolls or lumpias, these really have a ton of lemongrass flavor. They don't come with sauce but are great with banana ketchup, which you should already have in your pantry anyway!

Lastly, TJS has a lot of dark chocolate bar options mostly for $1.99 or less. My faves so far are the toffee, walnut and almond with sea salt, and the bacon and ganache, both of which are located next to the check out aisles.

Make sure to also grab a tiny cup of coffee and a free sample while you're there! That is how I found out about the lemongrass sticks!",3

16257,2,1550880000000,"Ok the food was good.  But thats about all i can say, which I suppose is important considering it IS a restaurant.   
BUT.....  I expect a lot more from a restaurant -- especially a new one listed as ""hot and new"" (at the time).   Yep, I will go on about this, anyone who reads my reviews will hopefully get it.

1. MUSIC.  Im not just saying I didn't like the music.  there was something  REALLY wrong with the sound system like someone disconnected a wire and only half of the frequencies were coming out of some fried wire behind the furnace(??).  I swear it wasn't just me.  My friend who was with me works in music and even offered to go fix the system for them.  It was SO bad i felt kind of queasy or bad trip or something. Completely distracting, especially combined with........
2) YELLING! Every time anyone would walk in the door there was some sort of yelling they did.
I understand if it was one of those places that had games or an mc or whatever (they have this crap in north hollywood but this is like the outskirts of las vegas)  and also florescent lighting,  Totally please NO.   
3) the ""all you can eat"" rules and regulations.  Im not an ""all you can eat"" person.  First of all, i can't eat very much and second because i don't like rules!   These rules were so confusing and restrictive.  They could not totally explain them (maybe because its a new place?) yet, anything we asked for seemed to be impossible. Also, there were all these stipulations written in chalk on some blackboards near the ceiling.  I just wanted a tuna roll with avocado, but that turned into a humongous discussion i finally gave up and got shrimp hibachi.  Then I spent a long time looking for a shrimp within a sea of diced zucchini.  
On the more positive side, its 2 for 1 saki and  there was some sort of shrimp ROLL that everyone in the entire place was going crazy for.  I just don't order shrimp rolls.  So maybe IM the problem!!!?

I feel a little bad saying all this, hence the 3 stars rather than 2, mainly because the staff was super nice and obviously trying very hard to please everyone.  I hope they can work out the sound system thing.  Also, its right next to a big movie theater so its technically a good dinner and a movie place!   

follow chalk instructions, wear earplugs, the theater is 2nd run movies so tix are cheap.  
I would go again, but not on purpose...... or get take out.  truth be told, we were aiming to go to the thai place next door which is for some reason closed on tuesdays.  wow.",3

There are some really good items you can get in the bar area during happy hour which are enough to fill your belly while you drink some drink.

The food here is very good 98% of the time and it is a place I like to come to every so often.  For a chain type place, they really know how to keep you coming back and I have always had a pretty decent experience here.  

I recommend Outback and if you have not been for a while, it may be time to revisit and if you can, sit at the bar, you should have a good time.",2

Service was spot on, they came and took drink order right away.  I ordered the oatmeal, and my friend ordered eggs, bacon and toast.  The oatmeal was delicious, they served it with butter, milk, and brown sugar on the side.  Perfect!  We also had cofee which also tasted great.  Had 2 cups!.  My friend also loved his meal.  The prices were great also.  Only 16.00 tab at the end of the meal. What I really enjoyed about the place were the servers.  All were dressed nicely with makeup and were very friendly.  I will definetley visit again.",3
16269,1,1550102400000,"Went to the Ahwatukee location to try it out tonight for dinner, fist impressions of the place was nice. The decorations were interesting. Very open, tables lined with paper, people with bibs on and the bar was full.  The hostess sat us and asked if we had ever been to their restaurants before and we replied ""no"".  She then walked away and said our server would be right with us. I was thinking she would explain the theme of the restaurant or the menu but I guess not.  

Our server came by and got our drink order.  While we were checking out the bar the manager came by and greeted us and asked us if this was first time we said yes, he thanked us for coming in and walked away, again no explanation of how the menu works or how things are prepared, not a big deal our server will get to that hopefully.   The food choices is short and simple, the back side is covered in different beers.  They might have more beer choices than food. 

Server comes back with our drinks and he explains the menu sections and market prices for seafood and the different seasonings. We started with hush puppies and a half dozen of oysters. We then ordered a pound of clams in the trifecta with corn and sausage. We also ordered  the soft shell crab po boy. 

Oysters and out and they were nothing special, golf oysters I think. The horseradish sauce was tasty, odd they served it with limes though. Hush puppies were good odd it was served with ranch. 

The clams, corn and sausage come out in a plastic bag. No plate to dump it out onto, different to be earring out of a plastic bag but kind of neat too. What surprised me was that my clams, corn and sausage were drowning in a butter garlic sauce.  not what I expected because the server didn't make mention that it was butter based until after we are and I asked him if all the sauces were butter based.  He neglected to tell us that all of them are butter based except for the plain boil which is water based and the pacific rim is curry based.  That would have been good to know before ordering. The menu states it's crab boil, I expected a crab boil.   I think I might have gotten 12 clams  and only 9 of them had meat in them. Sifting through the bag and sauce I found 1 piece of meat.   So for 12 bucks I got 10 pieces of clam. Totally understand the pound is including shell weight but at 12 bucks a pound I'd expect a piece of meat equivalent to the number of shells.   Sausage was tasty as was the corn. 

The soft shell crab po boy came with Cajun fries.  Fries were really good, good seasoning and crispy. The Po Boy, not so much. The crab had a real fishy taste to it, can't say I've ever had the same taste in other soft shell crab Po Boys I've eaten before.  The breading was so so, had a very heavy taste that left an after taste. 

Total bill came out to 50 bucks for two of us.  It was worth trying but for the money I've had better elsewhere. I might come back to try the gumbo.  

They are newly opened so hopefully the service works itself out. I can see this place being a decent place for happy hour or maybe lunch but I'd skip this place for dinner. 

Value in the food not so great, service was only ok but that should improve over time. Selection of beers was excellent. Overall I won't bring the family there but might do lunch or happy hour there.",2

Its a really cute really small pool area. Its surrounded by cabanas and beds that you can flop out on..which I did.
The pool is small but thankfully there were not that many peeps there otherwise Im sure it would not have been so relaxing.
And it was nice and relaxing. They played decent music over the speakers as well.

Our two guides are Yosemite addicts- they have hiked almost every trail in the park and really love Yosemite.

The pho was great, though a bit lacking on tendon. The best food of the night probably went to the bahn mi and the shrimp egg rolls - both were truly the stars of the meal. We also had the salad bowls, calamari, and taro boba. The boba was good, the salad bowls had HUGE servings, and the calamari was alright, though it didn't really taste like squid and was a bit on the burnt side. I wouldn't want to end on a bad note, so I'll just say this - go here! It's well worth your time and money.",2
16326,2,1549238400000,Had a great lunch special - grilled cheese and Italian wedding soup for $6. Soup was very flavorful and sandwich was perfectly browned.,3
16327,3,1551312000000,"Maskadores is by far the best taco and burrito I have ever had in my life. I used to swear by Ana's Tacqueria in Boston but this may have changed my mind! 

Everything tastes homemade-from the irregular tortillas, to the bar of salsas, in particular the serrano salsa, and marinated meats.

I could taste each ingredient separately and also as a whole. My first bite into a chipotle chicken burrito revealed the flavor of well seasoned beans, rice, and a marinade that soaked every crevice of the chicken. All the vegetables tasted fresh with a strong bite and the homemade guacamole, a little too sour, worked well as part of the whole. I was worried at first that the burrito would be too salty but every bit was perfectly seasoned.

I have yet to try many of the other wonders here and plan to stop by more. I will keep you updated.

My one critique would be to balance the guacamole with maybe a little less lime and little bit more salt.",3
16335,1,1549411200000,"This place isn't too bad. I thought there was some good points to this restaurant. I love the fact that they serve such fresh salmon for a buffet. It definitely taste a lot better than Joe's sushi. The albacore sushi was pretty good too and the other ones are just whatever. 

Personally I thought the hot food were pretty bad. There wasn't really one item that I love. They were either nasty or nothing special and I wouldn't try to get it again. I also tried the udon which wasn't that great to me. The udon was pretty nasty which disappointed me. 

The thing I did love about it is the fact that i can get unlimited amount of Shrimp Tempura. I am never satisfied from Japanese restaurant when they only give you 1-2 shrimp tempura but this place did allow me to get 10+ shrimp tempura. hahaha that was one good point to me.

I also like the fact that they provided 4? different kind of ice cream. I'm pretty sure they were all bought but if i can get unlimited amount of red bean ice cream thats gonna make fat and happy. 

Also didn't try the other desserts(cakes except the shaved ice) because it didnt look that great . Don't try the shaved snow...it was absolutely nasty. -_- I do enjoy the fruits since they give the chocolate fountain where I can tip my strawberries into it. I love strawberries without and with chocolate. :)

Anyway I would say this place is probably 2.75 but i must say for a buffet i thought the sushi was quite fresh. I really do enjoy the salmons that are actually fresh. I went there for lunch and it was about $20 after tax/tips which i find really cheap. It wasn't too bad. I wouldnt mind coming back here if i was walking the outlet since its so close to it and its nowhere close to the strip.",2
16338,1,1549756800000,"LOVE this place! This has quickly become my go-to place to eat! It's definitely the best sushi in Cleveland, and at reasonable prices. The wait staff is always friendly too.

We were told that the wait would be an hour and 15 minutes and decided to wait it out and grab a drink downstairs at gallery 22 since they had an ipad and would text us when our table was ready. After over an hour and a half we went back upstairs to check on our table situation and there were multiple tables open outside. We asked them what was going on and they said that the could seat us right away. Once we were seated we were greeted in a timely manner by our waitress. The drink menu had some very interesting selections but none of the ""go to"" drinks that were easily identifiable. We ordered tapas and a sushi roll.

They also create amazing Vietnamese sandwiches using those same delicious baguettes.

16356,1,1549584000000,"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch after a date at the Carnegie Museum. The restaurant was crowded.. there was a 10 -15 min wait for a table so we sat at the bar. The bartender was friendly and rocking out that bar. He was no doubt seasoned. So hungry..ordered food.. the wait was at least 25 min for it to arrive. Maybe they were short staffed in the kitchen? My burger n fries were uneventful (meh) and at that point we would of ate anything. The spicy cole slaw was delicious!   There were plenty of interesting options on the menu from periogies to tacos. It was fun to browse. 

I had a feeling the mac and cheese was the hit on the menu.. just wasn't in the mood for it. 

The prices vary on the menu .. some menu items are high such as the tacos (pork) for $15.00 and burger with a tiny handful of fries for  $8.00. 

Chose Harris grill because figured the prices would be more reasonable than other restaurants in the area... it was and was an ""ok"" lunch.",1
16365,1,1550620800000,I love this place. The food is always fresh and the menu is very different than any other restaurant in the area.

16365,2,1550620800000,"I ordered the chicen entree with a beef kabob and safron ice cream.  This place is located in a strip mall and the inside was warmer than my comfort level would have liked it to be on a summer afternoon.  

The rice was bland but it was individual grains (which not all places have).  The chicken was WAY too salty and had little to no real seasoning/spice.  It was almost if they thought salt was seasoning!  The ice cream was just OK.  I think the grilled tomato cost $1 extra, but I wouldn't be able to really comfirm since they don't give you a copy of the receipt (but my math tells me that is how the final bill worked).  

First time there, and won't be going back.",2

Just a bizarre experience that left us unsatisfied.

Thai'd Up reminds me of the many small restaurants in Bangkok where the food and meals are prepared with care. So many ingredients per dish, I don't know how they make it all come together and taste so good. Thai'd Up is new and has a fresh decor and a friendly staff. For my first meal, I had many wonderfully prepared dishes including the best  fish fillet dish I've had at any restaurant in years called Two Oceans. While I was busy enjoying the fabulous Green Curry, my dinner party quickly ate the big plate of fish, my friends eat a lot and obviously faster than me. The service was good and they care a lot about preparing and serving up an enjoyable meal. Glad we ordered too much food so I  had extra to take home.

16401,1,1549929600000,"Found this place on yelp while we were running errands in their area. Previous reviews mention that it is a 'vegan' restaurant and I want to clarify that since they use eggs, including some of the noodles, it is a vegetarian restaurant, but there is no shortage of options to choose if you so desire a vegan meal. 

We ordered the crispy wanton appetizer, veggie house soup, crispy beef, crispy scallop, and the fried rice with egg. 

The filling in the wonton was sort of a veggie mash that was bland and the wonton wrapper was thick and rather starchy. You definitely needed to dip it in the sweet sauce that accompanied the dish. 

The soup was a mild cabbage broth with celery, bits of carrot, fennel, and tofu cubes. I found myself adding more and more white pepper to season it. I appreciate low sodium in dishes, but it still should be seasoned well to avoid a blah blandness. 

The crispy beef was pretty tasty. You have to eat it right away or the sauce gooeys the crispyness into mush. The crushed peanuts on top added a nice texture. The broccoli that was served along side the dish was just steamed and a bit on the cool side when it reached our table. 

The crispy spicy scallops had a sweet in spicy sauce that had red bell peppers and thinly sliced Persian cucumbers. The scallops were good for me but my partner couldn't get over the chewy texture. They use giant oyster mushroom stems to make the scallops. There was definitely a taste of mushroom. Not the dish for you if you don't like mushrooms. 

The fried rice had raisins, pineapple, peas, egg, veggie ham, and veggie crab. The rice was typical fried rice in flavor with a small note of sweetness from the raisins and pineapple. The veggie ham pieces were so small, you didn't even notice them. The veggie crab had the consistency of little gelatinous snot balls and did nothing for the dish. I picked them out. 

The service was great. Our server was overly happy and constantly smiling and even brought our toddler a free bowl of steamed rice.
 The ice tea is worth noting. They brew it there using red tea leaves. It was crisp and refreshing and we prob had 5 refills. The green tea is not loose leaves but is in a tea bag added to your tea pot. 

I would not go out of my way to come back, but if I was in close proximity, and hungry, and it was lunch time so I could get the $6.50 lunch special, then I'd prob pop in for more of that crispy beef.

So 2 stars for the food and an extra for our friendly server.",3

We were sat at a high top table. Comfortable seats. We got chips and salsa as an appetizer, the salsa was pretty good. I ordered a California burger, sis ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and sweet potato waffle fries. My fries were hot and my burger was good. I also had a Kentucky Mai tai? It was a good drink for me, tasted just like fruit punch. See how I keep using the word ""good""? That's how everything was here, everything was decent, good, average, just VERY average. Nothing was exceptional or standout to make me come back ever again, but I was pleased with my experience. Nothing to complain about! I really do believe they need something to give them an upper hand over the other billion places that serve American food. Plain burgers and tenders aren't doing it.",2

We started off the meal with the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido.  It was excellent.  By far the best queso fundido I have had maybe ever.

They bring a good variety of bread to the table.  I am partial to the cornbread.  It has little pieces of jalapeno baked in.

For my entree I chose the Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbitt.  It was great.  It comes as a tenderloin and a leg.  The meat was tender, and the sauce added great flavor.  Even the toasted cous cous was tasty.

16431,2,1549411200000,"Yesterday was my second visit to Paramount Fine Foods. I was with 5 friends and we arrived early (11:30 a.m.) on a Wednesday. We were seated promptly and handed menus. Freshly baked pita was delivered to our table shortly thereafter. We sat with our menus for quite some time until we realized we were supposed to go up to the counter to order. No one mentioned this to us and I had honestly forgotten since I hadn't been there in about a year. We were told that since we were all seated at the same table, we all had to pay at the same cashier, which seemed a little silly, but whatever...

I ordered the Greek salad with 2 appetizer falafel balls on the side. The salad was quite good, if a little overdressed. It had plenty of feta cheese and 5 Kalamata olives. The falafel were really great. They were crispy and really tasty. No complaints there.

3 of my friends ordered the fattoush salad with chicken. They all complained that there was FAR too much pita in the salad and that it was a bit greasy (the pita). They also said that their chicken was very overcooked and stringy. But they did say that the salad itself was quite tasty.

1 friend ordered the butter chicken pizza. It came on a paper plate for some strange reason. Other than the terrible presentation, she really enjoyed her meal and said it tasted great.

Another friend ordered the chicken shawarma in a pita and said it was just great. She had no complaints.

All in all, the food wasn't bad, but also wasn't all that great.

The restaurant itself is really large, with a fairly large patio for extra seating. There is also a little play area for children. Even at 11:30 in the morning on a weekday, the place was quite busy and very loud. There were a lot of children running around and being quite rowdy. There was also extremely loud music blasting which made conversation a little difficult.

The prices aren't bad, although perhaps a little high for a restaurant where you have to line up at a counter to order your food (and pay first).",2

Minutes later the server returns with the kitchen manager (I think) and the manager apologizes for the inconvenience and gives me my dish on the house.

Half star earned only because I had really good service from the waiter and the greeter. They were attentive. 

Food - not good. I had the calamari dinner. Calamari was greasy and I got a number of pieces were the batter was removed from the calamari - not sure if it was on purpose to save on calamari or because the breading stick. 

Rice - small portion. Salad - wilted mess. Potatoes - one quarter piece. Not sure where the rest of them went.

We had a couple of drinks and the Ahi Tuna Wonton appetizer - it was all great! The bartender was friendly and helpful. The aquarium that serves as the wall of the bar is pretty amazing!

Next we were going to  go to a wedding Chapel that we found online during our search. As we walked of the of the courthouse 2 people confronted us and asked if we had a place in mind. One guy who was representing Vegas Simple Wedding Chapel gave us a coupon and wallked us over to the Chapel. We had both been married before so we felt we didn't need a big fancy expensive Wedding. We had a simple wedding. It was realitively inexpensive.  Nothing Fancy. Just a quick simple ceremony.  I would have gave them 5 stars but for whatever reason we did not recieve  the pictures that the brochure promised.

We stayed on a renovated floor, room was nice and clean. Elevators were a joke. We had to use the SPA elevators. There were only 3 in service, one of which stopped at every floor on the way down for no reason. There were always lines to get on to go up and they took for ever and were packed going down.

I had to pay the famous ""resort fee"". For internet and phone I didn't use and a pool that was always closed. If you want to sleep well on Friday or Saturday, forget about it. 20-somethings running through the halls, crashing into doors, playing loud music and making noise til 6 am is the norm. I called the front desk and complained and they did nothing.

Me and the fellas (a group of 8) go to Vegas every Feb and will most likely NOT be staying here again.

Also, try to get a room higher up and on the side facing Paris/Cromwell. Otherwise you will be listening to music and kids screaming all night in Carnaval Court, and as I said, do not expect an uninterrupted nights sleep.

UPDATE: Called them and got the expected answer. Told them paying a ""resort fee"" when things like the pool are closed is ridiculous. 2nd year in a row we requested the block of 4 rooms be next to each other (and we booked very early) and they weren't even close. I will save up and spend extra for a nicer place next year. I am done dealing with garbage in the halls, people puking in the hall and all night parties that spill into the hall until all hours.

Service:  (5.0)  They hit it out of the park for me.  The hostess was very nice and quickly informed us about the restaurant week menu, the later-night happy hour menu, and the regular menu (we had plenty of options).  We at ate the bar and the service was great and friendly.  Our bartender was knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks.  We had to quiz her on a few menu items to narrow down our choices and she knew everything by memory.  She also didn't try to upsell us at all, which was nice.  She was also great to talk with and a fun person in general.

Ambiance: (4.0)  It's an understated joint with dim lighting.  Nothing special, but certainly not off putting.  I could see it working for a romantic dinner or a casual meal with friends or family.

Menu: (2.0)  I'm giving it a low rating because the main menu is just too big.  the food on the menu is great, but the size is overwhelming.  The happy hour menu at the bar is short, but it focuses on a few good items such as a crudo sampler, a delicious sausage pizza, a burger, mussels, and a couple other items.  It's really just the standard fare most modern Cleveland restaurants serve, but $5 an item is a solid deal.  The regular menu, as noted, is way too big. Even so, everything on the menu sounded great and we ultimately selected a mix of menu and happy hour items: the crudo sampler, sausage pizza, tongue and eggplant caponata, and garganelli with sweetbreads and gizzards.  

Food:  (3.5 overall) Delicious!!  

The crudo sampler (2.0) was the weakest of the bunch.  It consisted of: scallops with tobiko, scallions and lemon zest; yellowtail with pesto and tomatoes; tuna with lardo; and salmon with orange, fennel, red onion and fennel pollen.  the scallop and the tuna with lardo were both perfect.  The yellowtail and salmon both seemed too fishy for something that should have a very clean flavor, IMO.  Even so, the combinations of flavors in each crudo item worked well. 

The tounge dish (4.0)  incorporates a sweet and sour eggplant caponata.  Don't read ""sweet and sour"" as some sort of Asian influence.  The caponata is actually somewhat traditional and rustic, but the slices of tongue elevate the dish a bit.  The tongue was perfectly cooked and it had a great rendered fat mouthfeel that went well with the eggplant.  The dish lacks a bit of color, but the flavor and textures more than makes up for it.  

The garganelli pasta (5.0) contains sweetbreads, giblets, radicchio, butter, parmesan and breadcrumbs (real breadcrumbs, not some canned junk).  First, the pasta was excellent.  This wasn't some dried pasta pulled from the store shelf.  This is fresh pasta made with care and skill.  Chinato does make their pasta in house, but they don't have an extruder to make things like garganelli and fusilli.  Now, I love Ohio City Pasta, but they didn't get this from Ohio City Pasta.  Whoever made their extruded pasta put an artisan touch in the recipe.  The rest of the dish was equally impressive.  The giblets had just the right amount of give in the bite and the sweebreads were cooked to perfection.  I was worried that the bitter radicchio and the butter parmesan might overpower the sweetbreatds, but that wasn't the case at all.  Everything was in perfect balance. I was happily surprised by the salt level in this dish.  Rustic Italian food tends to use a bit more salt than one might expect.  This dish kept with that salted tradition, which I liked.  A heavy hand of salt in some food can be a terrible experience, but not with this dish.

The Sausage Pizza was also great (3.5).  The crust was thin and a little crispy, with a great char.  I would compare it to a Neapolitan-style pizza, but with a bit more chew to the crust.  However, this isn't some artisan pizza from a wood-fire oven.  The sauce was simple and let the tomato flavor shine, the mozzarella was of a good quality, the were conservative with the cheese, and the sausage seemed fresh and crumbled to the perfect size.  The crust actually had a good bread flavor too--many pizza makers don't put much thought into the flavor of their dough.  It is a light crust and it's pizza in a more proper/traditional form; don't expect to get delivery-style pizza here.  

Overall, I say it was a 3.5 to a 4-star experience (I'm leaning towards 4).  Had the crudo been better, it would be a 4.5 to 5-star dinner.  This place has a lot of Zack Bruell hype, but I think it actually lives up to that hype.   I'll certainly go back to see if we get a repeat experience.",3

16552,2,1549497600000,"Went on a Saturday morning, and it was packed...that was a good sign!  Although it was packed, we only had to wait 10 mins for the 3 of us.  I had the Eggs Maximilian with chorizo...wow...what a huge meal for $10.  I was pretty well nourished for the remainder of the day.  Full of flavor since it had everything but the kitchen sink in it.

Service was fast and friendly...drinks never got below 1/2.

Will definitely be back!!!",2
16555,3,1549065600000,"This place is ok, they don't try to up sell you on things you don't need and the prices are reasonable. I would have given a higher rating if I didn't have to bring  my car back to have them fix things they should have caught initially. Their hours are business hours so getting off work multiple times to bring my car back is inconvenient. Also, the last time I called them and left a message they didn't return my call. I would go back but I will also be looking for a place that pays a little more attention to detail and has better customer service.",2
16562,3,1549324800000,Hobak was amazing. Coming from Hawaii it was a different experience from what we have there. The meat was tender and we got a lot of attention. Overall I felt like the sides were good and the meat was prime. Annabelle and Exo were a good server and cook. Good service and food. 5 stars! :),2
16569,3,1550448000000,"I loved Alo so I was really excited when its casual sister restaurant, Aloette, opened up.  The restaurant does not take reservations.  Unfortunately I had to take a star off for the cold that we had to endure as we were seated right across the main door, which they kept opening and closing as guests entered/left.  Maybe add some curtain to that door to block out the ridiculously cold air if they must have seats there?

We ordered the mac & cheese to share, it might've been one of the best I've had.  My fiance ordered the Aloette burger and fries, which we had to send back to the kitchen as the patty was pretty much raw.  Second star off.  The roasted pork belly that I had was tender and juicy.  So overall I have some mixed feelings about Aloette.  Would I go again?  Maybe, but not if there's a long line-up. Or better yet, try my luck and make a reservation at Alo instead.",1
16570,1,1550880000000,"This was our friends favorite place in Charlotte so I was excited to give it a run. Great little spot, I liked the look and feel. I went with the Chimichanga because I read a review where it ""sent her to the heavens"" ha. Loved that. I may not have been raptured but it was good. They have a great queso and salsa, no complaints. I'm not particularly a cilantro salsa fan but it wasn't too much and didn't distract from the fresh taste. Service was on point. Would have loved to enjoy their nice patio but it was a little chilly.",2

16581,3,1550016000000,Ever since the new management this place is amazing. Ive been here 8 times in the last 3 months and it never disappoints. The staff is amazing and so os the food and new building.,2
16583,3,1550188800000,"Absolutely phenomenal. Seriously.... every single thing! My friends and I waited 2 months for a reservation for 6. It was worth the wait. We've already made reservations for next time. We had a lot of the appetizers on the menu. I can say that they were all PERFECTION. The Papa Bravas were out of this world. I ordered what I thought would be a basic taco ""Pollo Asado"" and it was anything but basic. I've really never had anything better. Highly Highly HIGHLY recommend this place! We'll be back ASAP!",1
16587,1,1551225600000,"I came here for lunch and ordered a Ham and Cheese Baguette (~$8), which comes with a small salad. I also got an almond croissant and coffee. Now the sandwich was great, the bread was especially delicious, but I think the almond croissant (~$4) was the star of my meal. It's probably one of the best almond croissants I've ever had and I order those wherever I can find them. They make their own almond paste, import their butter from France, and get their flour from Europe. They make a point to bake their goods from scratch and the quality is obvious from how it tastes. Definitely going to order more of these in the future and maybe also try the almond chocolate croissant that they offer. As for the coffee, they use Lavazza coffee, which is a good, strong Italian coffee. I'm not an espresso person, but they offer espressos in single and double shot as well. 

The interior is clean and when you walk in, you immediately see the window of pastries and cakes directly ahead, fresh bread on the shelf, and a huge chalkboard menu showcasing their options for drinks, sandwiches, breakfasts, savory crepes, and more. There are about 5-6 tables inside and I think 2 tables outside (mostly see people choose the outside for smoking or because they have a dog). The service here was top notch and the two sisters who run it seem really passionate about the place. One of them is from Sweden and speaks five languages, which I thought was awesome. 

When Bonjour first opened under its original owners, I absolutely loved this place. Then there was a second owner and the quality seemed to go down while the prices went up. At a certain point, I stopped coming to Bonjour altogether. Thanks to Yelp I found out that Bonjour was yet again under new management, so I went to check it out. Now, the third/current owners (the two sisters mentioned above) are looking to put their own spin on the place while keeping a lot of the traditional French offerings without sacrificing quality. All in all, I'm glad Bonjour is back. It's a great place to grab a coffee and a meal/pastry. They're making some new breads too, some of which are very brioche-like. I'll definitely be back in the future to try out some of their new creations.",2
16589,1,1550620800000,"The nastiest tacos I have ever tasted, No phone  number on the receipt to call to tell them $12 spent on garbage.Buy at your own risk.

16599,2,1548979200000,"I wandered in here since I was shopping at the Big Lots next door and the Target that's in the same plaza, and was pretty impressed with this place.  

They have a wide variety of items--furniture, exotic foods, home decor, spirits (wine and beer), sodas, gifts/toys, and international snack foods/beverages.  I like coming in from time to time to see their holiday displays, though, as well as their holiday-themed gifts.  

I guess I'd consider this place a great store for those who seem to have everything.  

Bonus: free coffee and tea samples, as well as free membership with the World Market explorer for discounts, mailings, savings, sneak peak emails, and birthday rewards by supplying your email/mailing address.  With this membership, if you purchase 6 12 oz bags of coffee, the 7th is free.

They seem to have a little bit of everything in terms of beer and wine, as well as international foods and snacks.  They also have a small selection of gluten free items (chocolates, nuts, and chips) that are moderately-priced.",3
16604,1,1550966400000,"So I totally love the Vig on 40th St and I was glad to hear they opened a new location.  I have been wanting to check it out since it opened but just never had the time.  So what better time to go then on a Sunday for 1/2 price bottles of wine :).  

I really love the new location's look.  It was a little hard to find if you have never been but after a drive by I found it on the second pass.  The building is very modern and really open inside.  Instead of the outdoor patio like the 40th st. location they have a huge Arizona room in the back.  It still has a fireplace but instead of a fire it's lit with candles.  This will be really nice for the summer months when the other patio is way too hot.  

So on to the food and wine.  I ordered the starter crab and artichoke dip which was heavenly.  For beverage I got a bottle of Lapostolle Casa Sauvignon Blanc.  It was very good and with the half off price it was only $10.50.  

On to the entree I ordered the Achiote Salmon and Chorizo Arepa.  The salmon was good but being from Seattle I could tell it was Atlantic.  It's not necessarily a bad thing but I'm kind of a salmon snob :).  Anyways the Chorizo Arepa was very good.  It's a little sweet corn cake with Chorizo in the middle.  EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH CHORIZO!!!! 

Overall a great atmosphere, great food, and a great restaurant.   I can't wait to go back for Sunday Brunch they have some great stuff on their menu for it and they open at 10am till 2pm.  MMMMMMMM",2
16619,1,1550188800000,"Long lines today as they starting using phone numbers again.  You have to use your phone number and Link it up to the Albertsons app to get the sales price. You have to select the discounted item and then add it to your list. It is really difficult to shop like this. The lines are long people are pulling out their phones trying to explain what the price is. Cashiers are having difficult times.

This is a deal-breaker for me. I just can't shop with this much chaos and long waits. Confusion which seems like a trick more than a deal.",2

I ordered take out from FARMR about 15-20 mins in advance on their site before hopping in an Uber to pick it up. When I got there, the staff ignored me for a few minutes until I made eye contact with someone at the register. Whatever. So I grabbed my food and left the spot to go home and eat my food in peace. It smelled great in the bag, but as soon as I got home and looked inside the container, I knew immediately that it wouldn't taste as delicious as it smelled. 

The Lentil & Chickpea Fritters were SO salty and dry. The Brussel Sprout and Red Cabbage side had a couple of Brussel sprout leaves in it, but no whole brussel sprouts to be found. This item was also topped off with a soggy unidentifiable fruit (possibly canned).

Needless to say, I couldn't get through the entire meal, but I wouldn't go back to FARMR nor recommend.",2

She normally has a case of zoomies when we get home because she's happy to see me and be home, then she goes to bed early and is still pretty worn out the following day. Dog Days has great deals on Thursdays and I've enjoyed taking advantage of that as well. The pup and I really enjoy Dog Days and we'll keep going back.",2

16656,3,1551139200000,"The Book Gallery is a great cerebral maze to go wander within where a few hours could easily turn into days. Like any self respecting book store it possesses the basic pedigree of a bedazzling selection of sections around everything from the Punic Wars to grooming your Pomeranian. Unlike the most other shops, the Book Gallery manages to pull off said mind bending pedigree with a good selection of the old and the new while avoiding that whole dirty hoarder vibe.

The Arizona section is actually really interesting and includes at least one to two copies of the Kolb brothers famous tome concerning the Grand Canyon as well as more modern books about Arizona. 

The layout of the shop is good but I still like the overall semi-mysterious creaky floor vibe, which constantly gives you the impression that you just might find a Mogwai around the next corner.",3

16668,3,1550707200000,"I was really hyped for this place, given the amazing reviews on Yelp, but I guess I set the bar and expectations too higher. We came for dinner and I had the oxtail dinner while my friend had the signature salad. The oxtail fell right off the bone, but I found the dish a tad too salty and strong in flavour. The salad was very well done, with mango, almonds, grilled chicken, and a tangy cranberry sauce. The speed and quality of service did leave something to be desired though, we found service quite slow and had to flag down a waiter for something. Contrary to other Yelp experiences, I didn't find my server friendly, if anything she seemed more pushy and annoyed.

It is a small restaurant, with around 20 seats, so if you're coming in a big group, or just to be on the safe side, I'd say make a reservation beforehand. Also, they have a black curtain/cloth right behind their door, which makes it look completely dark inside the restaurant when looking in, so just push the door to come in, even if it looks closed and dark inside!",2

They had whole variety of pizza slices on display, reheated to order. They looked good but I still wasn't quite feeling it. I ended up ordering the Classic Chicken Wings (unbattered) to go, 10 wings for 9.75.

We just took it instead because our children were very hungry by the time the order was ready. Other times, we felt cheated on the amount of rice that came with the take-out.

When greeted I had a New girl that had JUST graduated cosmetology school and was brand new at shop. She took 20 mins to file/trim toenails the tiniest amount. Then didn't know the order or steps to the pedicure. Another girl came to start my fill (I thought)!she started to grind off the color polish I had on my acrylic nails then decided to soak my nail color off when she started that I said, ""oh I didn't know you could soak gel polish off acrylics they usually just Drill it off when they prep to fill???? she didn't understand what I was saying as she didn't speak English well. Another girl comes by and  said ""Oh no what did she do? She wasn't supposed to do that....you'll probably need to take set off and start over. I'm on hour 2 1/2 now of pedicure getting toenails painted finally. They offered to do a design on big toe since now I had to wait to get nails fixed.

16736,3,1549843200000,"Surprisingly good. Was not expecting alot based on my first impressions.There was no one to greet and seat us upon walking in, and the menu was displayed on the wall like a fast food drive-in. I yelled ""hellloo?"" into the kitchen and someone finally came out and sat us and gave us menus. I was very glad to see vegan options for myself and ordered the veggie spring rolls and veggie pho. My husband ordered the pork banh mi, shrimp and beef spring rolls and beef pho. 

Service was lacking, the guy seemed more interested in playing apps on his phone behind the podium than takin care of us and we had to get up and walk over to him twice to ask for refills. Luckily the food made up for it! My tofu was still warm in my spring rolls so i know they made it fresh to order and the proportion of the vegetables and noodles in the roll was excellent. My husband was not so lucky, his beef and shrimp spring rolls were cold like theyd been sitting in the fridge waiting to be ordered. 

Generous servings of pho and rich deep broth, you could tell itd been simmering for hours to get the layers of flavor it had. I really didnt even need to put in any sriracha or hoisin, it stood on its own well. My husband loved his banh mi so much he got another one to take home for later. warm crusty french bread with pickled veggies and bbq pork, didnt blame him. Wish they offered a  vegetarian version of the banh mi

Waited a long time to pay and close our bill out, despite only 2 other tables being in there

 Before you place your order you grab an order form and a marker to select everything you want on your sandwich.

I don't have a lot of experience with guns, but he made sure I was comfortable with each gun. Of course, we all took pictures with each gun, our targets, etc., but we never felt rushed.

Fuku-patty with furikake & teriyaki, finished with crispy onion rings & fried egg.  The first bite was like a rainbow shining down on me. Like Willy Wonka farted candy into the air.  Runny egg oozing over the delicious patty, the sweetness of the teriyaki married together with the crunch of the onion rings.  A fairly sized burger, I felt the pricepoint was a decent value, considering it is Vegas.  I relished each delicious bite.

Service was okay.  It took a while for my burger to be cooked, but I know it's made fresh to order so I can't complain.  There is bar seating directly in front, with tables insided & outside FAME.

16807,3,1550275200000,"I would choose to give zero stars if that was an option but it's not.  So I guess I will just post this.....
First let's start off with this email from a reputable company in GR when we took our unfinished iPad mini to possibly get repaired for a ""cracked screen""

Oh boy, where to start, screen practically fell off as soon as I started heating it (weak adhesive). Noticed immediately the rust on the bottom right LCD screw. Also that screw was bent (the rusty one) and it was missing the two top screws, as well as the smart cover magnets. Moving inward, the mid plate is missing, and then I noticed the 2nd screw grommet for the screen flex cable cover was ripped out. Taking that plate off there is an immense amount of board damage where that grommet was ripped off. My guess is someone tried to twist in the longer screw that goes in that plate into this screw hole and just kept twisting, ripping the grommet off the board and taking components with it. Also noticed that the LCD is actually a regular ipad mini LCD and not the Retina display that it's supposed to have. My guess is they broke the LCD upon opening, installed this water damaged one, because they knew they broke it, and sent them out with it. So water damaged LCD, it's the wrong LCD, and the board is damaged.

So now that's been said.  I would like to point out that my husband took our iPad mini to this establishment and we were told it would be fixed in time before we had to leave the state. A.) It was not only incomplete and we had to travel with not one but two toddlers from LV to Michigan without it but 2 we find out that this company completely destroyed it beyond repair.  When calling to have them replace or repair the damage they've done we are told they don't keep copies of receipts nor will it be done because it's been over 6 months.  Well guess what Desert wireless this bash is just the beginning of what's coming for you.  I am filing in small claims come Monday.  I also have this gentleman to testify that the damage done to our device was caused by your establishment.  Good luck fixing anyone's devices in the future.

Perhaps other items on the menu are better? I enjoyed the fries. They were crispy, and not too oily. The service was good. My order was prepared quickly. C&D doesn't offer much by way of atmosphere.

16842,3,1549929600000,"Rather than going to a gun range and shooting automatic weapons in Nevada (since you can't do that in CA), we chose to take a daytime bachelor party activity to Combat Zone Paintball.  We thought this place was going to be on the Strip given it's on Las Vegas Blvd but it's actually about 15 minutes away.

This was my first time ever paintballing.  I'm not really a gun/shooting/violent person so I never really get into these things very much, but I had a ton of fun and you do get a good adrenaline rush when you're on the field, crouched down in a bunker taking heavy paint and firing back.  I was happy that getting shot by a paintball travelling 200 mph didn't hurt too much even though I was left with some pretty decent welts.

If you come here in a large group, I highly recommend playing capture the flag.  The staff was super nice, and friendly.  They seemed very grateful and excited that we chose to go there.

The other amusement about this place is being exposed to the culture of paintball.  Some guys who were there were ridiculously obsessed with paintball.  We are talking full camo suits, decked out like rambo and wired with two-way radios.  I think it's safe to assume these guys paintball all day and play Call of Duty all night.  It might be surprising to some but these guys were all actually super nice and wanted to paintball with us until the sun went down.

This past time I was there for the Semi Annual Sale which I've gone to every year just at different locations. The store was crazy, as expected, but the worker gave me a bag very quickly so I was happy about that! After about 10 minutes of shopping I went to the line which was huuuge but totally expected that. What wasn't so great was how the lines were handled. After waiting about 15 minutes, halfway to the registers, a worker quietly told someone behind me that the line beside us was CASH only. Well turns out some people (who I recognized now cause they had waited right next to me for 15 minutes) didn't know it was CASH only cause no one told them. Glad I wasn't in that line by accident cause I would have had to start all over in a different line.

Close to the front of the line they decided our line would be split into two and the worker quietly whispered to me to go to the front and left. My first thought was ""the people in front of me is going to think I'm cutting in front of him"". But I inched closer to the front and tried to do as I was instructed and sure enough got a look from the first half of the line and I'm like...maybe that lady should have made a louder announcement so people know what I'm doing. Then I saw the line she told me to go into was waiting on the same person for the past 10 minutes (they were having issues.)

It's simple. Take a seat on one of the computers and upload your pictures from your phone. Each Polaroid picture costs $1 (minimum purchase of 6). Good deal since actual Polaroid film costs just about the same and the quality is a lot better. The website they use has some bugs..I notice I had to switch to a couple computers to get some features to work. Could use some improving.

Tip: Make sure you edit and crop your pics before uploading! I wish the website had the option to do this and add filters.

You can add captions on your Polaroids and also add on custom frames. We chose the 6 picture frame. The wooden ones cost $35 and the rubbery silicone $25. I notice the silicone gets dented and damaged easily so I opted for the wooden.

The customer service was great all around. Whenever I had a question while on the computer, it was easy to flag someone down. And everybody has been really helpful and friendly.

The mackerel was awesome!  It was a large portion and deep fried well!  Very crispy and perfectly salted.  Call to verify they have mackerel in stock because twice they were out.  The tofu soup on the other hand is very bland.  I asked for some hot sauce to make it hotter and they brought out the wrong chili sauce that doesn't pair well with the soup.  I've gotten the soup 2 more times because it comes with the mackerel and asked to make it very spicy but each time it's still bland.  If you want tofu soup, get it at Hidori or Chodang.  My wife likes the ox tail soup.  It's comparable to China Magic noodle house's version.  Her only complaint is that they put too much noodles in it, 1st world problem I guess.

The service is generally average.  Most of the time you have to ask for things such as refills and once while eating there they forgot a dish.  My one takeout experience involved them forgetting an entrée.  I didn't realize until I got home and had to drive all the way back.  They were not very empathetic and did not offer any compensation.  Another thing to add to this experience was that they place the sauce over the katsu in the takeout box.

Before finding her at Ca Va Bien, I found it difficult to get any feedback from stylists -- usually, they'd just do what I'd ask, regardless of whether they'd think it would suit me (and really, who would know best but a professional?).  They'd never give me their opinion, even if I asked for it, and weren't really open to much discussion -- get in the chair and get out.

Olivia is very open and sincere.  If I ask her opinion about a certain cut, or ask how my hair would handle a style, she's very happy to tell me the truth.  If I tell her about what I have in mind, she'll find a way to execute it so that it looks great with my face shape. She'll give me clear and easy tips on how to maintain the look at home too.

Yes, this place is a bit more expensive ($50-60 for a cut), but it's well worth it.  Even if I let my hair grow out a bit, it still looks stylish.  The staff will even serve coffee and home made cookies while I'm being served ... what a nice way to treat myself!

I thought at first she was referring to the battery life left on my phone then it dawned on me she was referring to a tip. We left a pretty generous tip in cash on the table and after she took the bill, she asked ""oh is that for me too?"". Tacky.",2
16908,1,1550620800000,"This is our first time staying in Flamingo. We overall satisfied with our room. It was on 21st floor facing the High Roller and it was romantic and we highly recommended than the strip view.

For the price, is reasonable and fit to our budget. Location is very nice and convenient right in the middle of the vegas strip. 

The guest service agent was helpful when I called and asking about ice machine on the floor.

Check in process was a little disappointed since they said that our high floor with high roller view (as requested & booked) was not available at first. On the other hand they offered the vegas strip view instead. Eventually, my wife got the room that she wanted after few chats.

The only thing flamingo needs to improve from our prospective:

- Turn down service every day
- Refilling up the toiletries
- HVAC that contaminated with cigarettes smells (everytime We turn the AC at around 11-3am, it smells cigarette in the room and smells is gone by 7am in the morning)

Cheers Flamingo!",2

Tried the Brown Bread today - yum! A scoop by itself would be perfect (but, of course I had to go and add hot fudge to it!). The BB flavor offered a nice balance of toffee coated bread crumb-like texture and creamy ice cream. It was quite sweet, but the bread helped to bring a little more balance to the sweet flavor. The hot fudge is house-made, which I always appreciate (typically the only time I order it). It was quite rich with a slight bitterness and a bit too sweet for my tastes. I also tried the Avo Jalapeno sample - tasted like a sweet guacamole and a bit too vegetable-ish for my dessert palate.",2
16938,2,1550448000000,"I don't recall where I first heard of Crazy Jim's. But when I saw it nearby on Yelp! today, I knew exactly where my girlfriend and I were going to eat lunch.

We enjoy finding out-of-the-way, mom and pop places when eating out. Crazy Jim's has been around for over 30 years and is hidden in plain site on the southeast corner of 15th Avenue and Indian School. Note: It's easier to get to from 15th Avenue and parking is behind the buildings on the corner.

Crazy Jim's is not a huge place. But the staff was extremely friendly and we were seated right away in the front section where it is well lit. It may be tight, but it has a certain charm that makes you forget about the non-descript buildings in the area. And once the food arrives, you will forget you're in Phoenix.

We started our meal, as we typically do at a new restaurant, by sampling the appetizers. I ordered the Roasted Red Pepper Hummus. My girlfriend added an order of Shrimp Scampi. Both are solid choices! The hummus was a generous portion and served with piping hot pita bread. And the scampi was simple and delicious. It was also served with fresh pita bread. Don't forget to soak up the scampi butter sauce with the pita bread!

I've enjoyed some good gyros around town. But the Steak and Feta Gyro I enjoyed today was better than anything I tasted at the last Greek-Fest I attended. The tender steak was cooked perfectly and it melted with the feta cheese, grilled onions and tzatziki sauce. Even though my family isn't Greek, the side of fries reminded me of the homemade fries my mother use to make. This leads me to believe that there is a lot of from-scratch cooking going on in Crazy Jim's tiny kitchen. And when have you ever held pita bread which was too hot to handle?

My girlfriend made a sensible choice by selecting from the very unique ""Not a Salad"" list. It's not a salad because it was made with cabbage. She really enjoyed the grilled chicken which was accompanied by the traditional Greek items (calamata olives, cheese, etc.). Oh, and another serving of their excellent pita bread!

In the end, we were stuffed and had a lot of left overs. Plus, we were very happy that we chose Crazy Jim's over a popular chain that isn't too far from here. We will definitely be back!",3

The girl who did my mani pedi was really sweet and very meticulous. It was the younger girl who is really cute (bad description, I know). Anyway, she did a great job.

Pretty small place packs in a lot. For myself, I was able to find a substitute for a moisturizer I was unable to bring on the plane for my vacation.  At the discussion of my friend, a native (also my host on my vacation to the area), I agreed with him that prices on imported goods, such as rice (grown in my home state, California), is rather exorbitant but not unexpectedly.

Alluring presentations of creamy and fruity gelato smack dab in a popular Venetian square. Blackberry was a bit icy, but the classic lemon was dreamy. Tart, almost to the point where your lips pucker, with tiny flecks of candied lemon peel in each bite. 

My scoop was a decent size, but service was terrible. The server behind the counter was surly and reluctant about giving samples to those before us, so I blindly selected my flavors. Phooey. No getting two flavors in the small cup.

If it weren't for the fact that we were living large this weekend and parched, I would not have shelled out this amount for gelato. In case you haven't heard: It's $6.25 per scoop. Yowza!

The pool area is nice.  They have very comfortable lounge chairs and it's quiet.  You would never know that you are so close to downtown.  I considered giving it four stars because  the rooms themselves (although plenty large with nice patios) are pretty plain.  But the general manager is friendly and says that they are still updating the property.  The bathrooms were beautiful and had great products, but I didn't get a chance to check out their spa.

17113,2,1549670400000,"Brak has been remiss in not reviewing Pizza Pit before now.  We originally dined here on a Groupon last year, and loved it.  But for no good reason other than it's not particularly close to home (though not a terrible haul either), we hadn't been back.  I was recently reminded that it's a place we should visit again.  We've now been back 3 times in the past few weeks, and I'm happy to report that Pizza Pit rates a SOLID 5 stars on the Brak-o-Meter.  How so? It's not a chain, it's a family-run joint, and looks and feels like it.  Lots of good TV's for catching whatever ballgame you're interested in watching.  A unique style of pizza, named after Fred Garvin's stomping grounds, the quad cities area, located at the Iowa/Illinois boundary.  It's a slightly thick crust with a unique texture that is difficult for me to describe, but I like it a lot.  The toppings are placed under the cheese, and the pizza is strip-cut rather than pie-cut (though I'm sure they'd oblige a pie-cut request).  Salads are bueno too, and there are sandwiches and stuff I haven't tried but I'm sure are good.. I just go straight for the pizza & a small salad and I'm one happy creature.

If you like supporting local businesses that deliver solid value, friendly service, and a great and unique twist on the old favorite pizza pie, then do yourself a favor and give Pizza Pit a try.  Brak is confident you'll be glad you did.  It's now on the short list of Brak's regular rotation joints, even if it's a bit of a drive.  Good stuff, Maynard!",2

17125,1,1549324800000,"Our group got there just after 9 on a Friday night and the place was still full of people eating - always a good sign. There was still a free table and so were seated right away. The server was prompt, friendly, and efficient - knowing when to engage us, check in to see how we were doing, but otherwise letting us enjoy our meal. The round of signature drinks was again stellar - the hot trollope is a curiously tasty drink that is my new starter drink - the pleasant jalapeño sear won't be for everyone but it works for me. For the main course, I tried the fried bluegill and it was perfect. The breading seemed wonderfully crunchy, crumbly, nicely seasoned, and generally very much homemade. The tartar sauce also blew me away. Wow. Tasted very homemade with what appeared to be coarsely chopped tender home pickled cucumber slices vs the usual chunks of tough-skinned canned pickles. The sauce seemed much less mayo based, possibly with some buttermilk to thin the consistency away from the mayo paste other places do, but this is a great thing - the greasy finish of mayo just doesn't need to be paired with fried fish - the GnB sauce has a much cleaner finish that really shines and accompanies the fish. The side of coleslaw and red potatoes with the fish were completely fine. My companion thought the potatoes were only just lukewarm but I didn't really notice or mind. They seemed cooked perfectly, served buttered and parsley'd, though they could have maybe used a bit of something - maybe a more pronounced garlic note, a splash of freshly ground black pepper, or maybe a small shave of fresh parmesan. The coleslaw comfortably rides the line between a creamier style and a purely vinegar based slaw - works for me. All-in-all, a near perfect meal!",2

This place is in a shopping center area and is on the second level so you need to climb a few stairs or use the elevator. Service was very good and the prices very reasonable. I started with the spring rolls with shrimp that came with this spicy peanut sauce that will make your bollocks tingle. In fact I saved the remainder of the sauce to use on everything else they brought me. Also had the green papaya salad which was unreal good. Slightly tart, citrus and spicy at the same time crunchy. Then had the chicken wings which were like little baby wings crispy fried with a spicy sauce to dip them in. Very, very good. Finished with the medium size pho bowl of the house special with beef, meatballs, tripe and whatever else they put in there along with those thin noodles and fresh basil and bean sprouts to add yourself plus chillies. The broth was flavorful but neutral mild so you could add what you wanted. I hit it with sriracha and some of the left over peanut sauce and wow, so many flavor levels it was like getting a lap dance on my tongue. Overall loved this joint.

Sadly, I'm pretty sure the bibimbap I've had elsewhere was more colorful and plenty more flavor than here.  Both of us dining added soy sauce, hot sauce, and ladled in soup and mushrooms from our side dishes, to make the bibimbap taste like anything.

17167,3,1549843200000,"HAUNTED!! (tm Kristina R)

.... Not.

My husband and I, along with a couple that we're friends with, stayed at this old Las Vegas hotel for three days. We had seen on TV that supposedly Houdini's ghost haunts this place. The only haunting that I experienced is the ""ghost of cigarettes past"". Ugh. Our room (which was 'nonsmoking') smelled like we were actually sleeping inside an ashtray. I think I might've gotten a nicotine addiction just from hanging out in our hotel room!

The place is run down, the guests here all are at the lower end of the economic scale, and about 20 years older than us on average, but you know what? We still had fun! I played my favorite slot machine: WHEEL! OF! FORTUUUUUNE!!! Yeah, baby, I made bank, too! I must've won at least $200 in quarters, and only put in about $40 of my own money to start... after that I played off my winnings. I came home with $180, which to me, is fantabuloso! 

I also played some roulette, and stayed at the table for quite some time (a couple hours) before I skedaddled with my winnings... a whopping $80. Hey, I doubled my money... how many of you can say THAT? (I always bring only $40 to a table. Never more. It's a hard and fast rule of mine.)

The diner inside the hotel was... well, a diner. It had diner type fare. Not bad. Not great, either, but satisfying.

The Plaza is right at the end of Fremont Street, though, which is a fun place to walk around at night, when it's all lit up and they have music going. There are lots of old casinos here that are probably haunted, too, from the looks of them. Old. Decrepit. Stinky. Yeah, they MUST be haunted! We didn't see any ghosts.... or DID we??

But we won't be staying here again.... it's too far from the strip, and it was kind of a bummer to have to walk to the bus stop, ride the hot bus for 20 minutes, and then peel yourself off the seats when you reach the Strip. Not too glamourous. 

If you're into ""old school Vegas"", where you might run into the ghost of Dean Martin, or Old Blue Eyes, then by all means, stay at The Plaza. If you want to be close to the shows, fountains, and general youthful glitter of Vegas, though, best to stay somewhere on The Strip.",3

PRO TIP: grab an extra cupcake at the end of your visit and pretend like you are eating it on your way out, then save it for later.

I've dined at all the Guu restaurants, including JaBistro regularly since they first opened up but over the past year, I've visited them less frequently as competitors popped, as well, I felt overall, the food, value and service has gone downhill. (It's a disappointing trend of many popular restaurants that have been successful enough to expand in the city. ) 

The food was ok, but I felt the portions were tiny, and presentation lacking. ( not to mention, why so much garnish???) 

Because I'm already wary, I visited the new location just to check it out. Got the maguro tataki, pressed seared salmon sushi, kimchi udon and karrage. ( note, karrage at the ramen places like Kinton is actually better than Guu an costs less) 

service: the worst I've seen. I feel generally bad for servers but during 45 mins of dining, I repeated saw ppl asking about missed plates and the table next to me as well as my table was brought the wrong dish at least 2 times.

So when a friend of mine told me they found Japanese curry at Redheads, I had to try it!
It did not disappoint! It was perfect - if I closed my eyes I could swear I was sitting in Shibuya.
Rich, hot, not too spicy, very flavorful - Japanese curry is a distinct flavor.
Get the Katsu Japa Curry - Tonkatsu is a tender pork cutlet breaded with panko and fried golden brown, and it swims with agility in the golden curry sauce.

The restaurant can be deceiving from the outside but there are three stories and it can handle a lot of people. We went somewhat early on a Friday night and it was packed already. Since there are three floors the noise level got to be a bit much but it wasn't the reason why I would only give this place two stars. 

I ordered the mussels Marinier and my mother ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola. The meal was pretty good, food wise but the service was terrible. There was one guy who gave us water and bread, another guy that opened our bottle of wine and then a third who was our actual waiter. Not once after receiving our food did our waiter return to check on our food or ask us if we needed anything but he had to pass our table multiple times in order to bring out food to other tables, clear things, etc. so it wasn't like we were in the back of the restaurant and he had forgotten about us--it just showed he didn't care. 

Since we were planning on having a leisurely dinner anyways we didn't realize how late it was and how long we had been sitting there after finishing our food until all the wine was gone and we had run out of things to say. In total, we were there for 1 1/2 hours! It took us nearly 10 minutes to try and get our waiter's attention just to get the cheque! And when we did he started to clear our dishes and took away my mom's pasta dish which was more than half uneaten without asking if she wanted it wrapped up--we thought it was very rude of him to assume that an uneaten plate of food was to be tossed in the dumpster. He also did not ask if we wanted dessert or coffee/tea which meant he made less on the tip. Overall, terrible service from our waiter (Adil) and since we had to fight tooth and nail to get his attention, my mom thought he deserved no tip at all.

We are big fans of the Go rooms, the adults only pool ( The large pool is now strictly 18 and older) and it's location on the strip. By and large we spent hardly anytime at all in the casino itself.  Do wish it had a cool bar or lounge.  

Plenty of Yelpers have added some helpful hints, but thought we would pass on a few too.

Check in: Might be worth using the desk vs. the quick computer check in.  We tried the quick check in and ended up staying in the Habitat tower....last year stayed in the Spa tower and enjoyed the layout a little more. The Habitat tower is guarded by Westin employees trying to give you a ""free"" gift.  Not a deal breaker, but ask for the spa tower Go rooms.  By all means, BOOK A GO ROOM.

Pool:  Don't expect to easily get a lounge chair if you show up past 10AM.  Think people run down to the pool and put towels on them at first light...play the game and do the same!  Grab a bloody mary while you are down there....they are awesome and only $5  from 8-11AM. The waitresses at the pool are swamped with orders, but all the ones we had the pleasure of talking to were super cute..I mean super sweet and helpful! If your hungry, order a burger!  Very filling and it goes well with the $20 bucket of beer.  Jeannie enjoyed the turkey wrap.  Tried the hotdog.  It had some major shrinkage going on ( supposed to be a Nathan's) and ended up filling up mostly on the fries.

Margaritaville: Stepped in there for the first time...for breakfast on the day we checked out.  A good bet and the price is on the low end for Vegas.  Have to try the bar one night...

Late night snack.  There is a food court ( two actually) that has a Johnny Rockets, a pizza place, a Panda Express-like joint and a sub  & salad place.  Had a pizza night cap twice and it was goooooood! Sausage and Pepperoni slice hit the spot.

Location:  There are so many entertainment and food options near by that you might want to be prepared to walk just a little.  Venetian & the Mirage are just within  comfortable walking distance (heels might be a challenge ladies) Harrah's & Caesar's are easy! Didn't really go the other direction, but think about keeping the car parked.  A much more colorful trip will be had on foot as you get a close up view of the Vegas ""humanity"".",3
17323,1,1550448000000,"J and I decided to go to First Friday, just for the sake of trying out the food trucks!  We discovered the little gem, Jamburritos!!  

$6 Chicken Jamburrito = tasty and very filling!!  :) And more than enough food to feed both J and myself.  I will say though, that the burrito could have been rolled a little tighter. 
$2 hush puppies = Super tasty!!!

The jamburrito had a nice little kick of spice to it.  Very Tasty!!  J and I were stuffed after each of us having half of the burrito (along with sharing half a hamburger from Ralph's).  Well worth the $8.00 for the burrito and hush puppies.",2
17324,3,1551312000000,"Came here with a friend during a weekend stroll. The place was packed! And it was 3pm on a weekend! Luckily, we were able to grab seats by the windows. The place is definitely cozy, but it gives off a really nice vibe throughout the surroundings. 

I had the Cuban sandwich and it was so good! The sandwich temperature was probably close to burning, but it makes all the difference when it's freshly made. My friend told me this was the best sandwich place in Montreal - and I don't doubt her words. There is a large variety of other sandwiches, so I would definitely return to try new items. I also saw many baked goodies (pastries!).

Service was alright - A little slow, maybe sitting in a corner was a bad idea. I don't really remember interacting with the waitress much, since she appeared to have many other tables she was managing. The one thing that probably carved an impression on me was the table spacing. I remember seeing other customers trying to find ways to leave their seats without having to step on anyones toes....Other than that, the place is definitely worth a visit!",2

Abalone and assorted meats soup

Bean Thread Vermicelli with Prawns in XO Sauce
Beef with onions on a hot plate
Fish Fillet with Sugar Peas
Snow Pea Vege (Tau Miu) in Garlic Sauce

Delicious, hot food.  Wait service was exemplary.  

Will definitely come back again.",2
17346,2,1549843200000,I have given this place 2 tries and they are just terrible. The sauce here taste funny and the overall pizza was not good. The worst thing about this place is the wait times. The last time I order over the phone app and it said my pizza was ready for pickup at 6:10pm. I got there right on time and watched them hand my order to the person in front of me. They then had to remake my order which made me wait there for 20 minutes.,2

17356,1,1549152000000,"I never thought of Bulgogi until one of my dinner guest said my beef skewers reminded her of Bulgogi. I vaguely heard of it, but never actually tried it. I don't know why I've never experienced Korean food and I'm not saying one visit to this fast food Korean joint qualifies me as any kind of authority on it, but I do know what tastes good and what I like.
I liked the Bulgogi at Juns. Despite a gentle snub from an actual Korean about Jun's being ""fast food"", we decided to give it a try anyways. I attribute that to Mel C's review (thanks, Mel!)
The Bulgogi plate was generous with rice, a fresh salad with a light asian love-you-long-time type of dressing, and thinly sliced, tender, flavorful, marinated beef stir fried with onions. I ate all the meat and enjoyed it. My only wish was that it could have had more of a carmelized sear to it. That would have made it perfect.
The other dish ordered was the Bi Bim Bop...fun to say, but another dish that was new to us. Rice topped with veges, like shredded napa cabbage tossed in sesame oil, stir fried meat with mushrooms, and topped with a sunny side egg, the yolk begging to be broken. We enjoyed that as well.
I know this may seem like going to Panda Express for Chinese food, but when it's good, it's good. 
My new quest will now be to find the best Bulgogi. Thank you Jun's for opening my Asian eyes (lol) to Korean food, and thank you for the wonderful service. The whitey I was with...aka my wife, is a bit high maintenance and knew even less about Korean food than I did. Our very nice server took the time to explain everything to her. This will be a nice weeknight quickie spot for us.",2
17362,2,1551312000000,"5 stars down the board. I've actually never heard of this place. After an intense gym session, Nieves D. suggested Millers Ale house. You had me at Ale! I guess they just opened a Henderson location. The old one is at Town Square.

Upon arriving, it was packed! But this place is very spacious with loads of parking. We found Carl I. and Baby TJ finishing up their meal and joined them. 

32oz pitcher for $10, you can choose from white/red sangria, loaded Arnold Palmer, margarita, electric blue LIT or mojito. The pitcher wasn't as big as I imagined but it was actually perfect for just us two. The drinks on the menu are pretty cheap though. 

They have daily specials so I ordered Thursdays special which was the Prime Rib for $12.95. Comes with 1 side so I got loaded French fries. Prime rib was pretty darn delicious. Cooked to perfection and just the right amount to feed my hungry muscles. 

We also ordered calamari due to Nieves D's obsession. It was drizzled with sweet chili sauce. It was really good. It wasn't over cooked and rubbery which usually happens with calamari. 

Service was on point. Our server today was Brittney. She had loads of personality and very helpful. A little on the chatty side but she was extra funny. Overall, cheap foods, good food, cheap drinks, good drinks, great experience will be returning as soon as possible.",2

17372,3,1550188800000,"Maybe it was the 15 minute wait for the freshly fried wings.  Maybe it was the business plan I was conveyed by the nice young lady behind the counter who informed of the four locations in the valley (that I have never seen aside from this one).  Maybe it was the hard sell of ""our most popular flavors"" that fell way short.  Maybe it was the structure of pricing wings BY THE POUND. Or maybe because it was EMPTY when I walked in.

This is your average wing shack.  Better than Flavor Flav's House of Horrors, but certainly not a top shop.  Maybe I will try another visit to see if their other flavors aside from Buffalo, Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan can appease my tastebuds.",2
17373,2,1551052800000,"Love it ! 

The chocolate cheesecake & vanilla macarons from this wonderful shop is to die for. 

The cheesecake is not too sweet, light & just seems to melt in your mouth :) Wish the portion was bigger. I ordered a medium for my bday but imho it was a tad small.. otherwise it was the best cheesecake i've ever had.

Lots of the flavours for the macarons are excellent! Be sure to try the vanilla, expresso, purple (forgot the flavour). I'm not sure why but I prefer these macarons over the Pierre Hermé macarons in Paris, France. Going to order one of each next time!",2

17393,1,1550275200000,"The place was fun, friendly, and good food.  I agree with some comments that the meats could have been better quality, but for what it's worth - it was quite a good time for a family outing. 

The bonus was the Samba ladies shaking their tail feathers (Fri/Sat only) and the live performers playing, Astrud Gilberto, and Stan Getz (my favourites!) - Wed to Sat only

We sat in the smaller intimate corner near the salad buffet, rather than in the middle which seems a bit cafeteria like. 
The servers were quite friendly and the wandering rodizo guys, are quite good at bringing requests of different meats. One guy let my boyfriend's mom hold the stick while we snapped a photo. 
The hostess seems really non-assertive and very insecure. Not much of a hostess. 

What do you get for $50 in terms of food:

 - all you can eat salad bar. Different varieties of cold salad (no labels on them, so had no idea) and soup (no labels, or handles on the lids!) that seemed to change throughout the night

 - different meats that come to you on a rodizo stick that they cut off for you
YUMS to :
brazilian steak (picana brazil)
top sirloin
lamb 
salmon
pineapple
friend banana
cheese bread ball

They also have rib eye, suckling pig (never saw it), salmon upon request

Tip: save your quote for the meats and don't stock up on the breads

All you can eat!

Parking: after 6pm the street east of it called Redpath, and the resdential streets north of it

I think this is a great place to take out someone for dinner, and have something different. Good family place.",2
17393,2,1549584000000,I really wanted to like this place after eating at the one in Chicago. But unfortunately it was awful the waffle was like rubber and the chicken wings not cooked all the way. Family waited for there food over 2 hours it was so ridiculous. The staff needs help or it will not be around for long..,2
17393,3,1549238400000,"After not getting into the National and the Ship my party walked across the street.  It was about 7:30pm on a Saturday night and after paying $5 cover we were seated.   This place reminds me of Cha-chi and jersey shore.   The characters on this patio look like guido's and guidettes, and wanna be Gangsters.   I should know, I'm from Vancouver and everyone looks like all the Surrey people that think their hot shat by being ghetto rich or hood.  To be honest I felt like the only way I would be alpha here was to be a total and complete  douchebag.   What's even weirder is looking at all the tatood'd people with Cowboy hats.   It's almost like anyone that didn't fit in with the regular cowboy club got thrown into this club by default.

The waitress looked like she hated being here.   There was a group of seven of us and she brought out food two plates at a time, which I found odd as many restaurants the waitress would bring a few dishes out on a tray.  And the beer was not brought out at the same time.  It was pitcher, some glasses, go back inside, grab another pitcher and then we waited awhile for our food.  I thought this was the end of the night...but...

The night gets better!

For what it is, the bar food is alright.  It may not be rock bottom,  buts it's still reasonable.  As for beer, Sals lager isn't too bad for $11 and some change per pitcher.  For large groups I would recommend the Nachos as the helpings were generous and they gave a lot of salsa and sour cream for the order!   The mushroom burger was alright and so were the fries.  Standard pub fare done alright, so I can't really complain.

The vibe of the inside of this club reminds me of movies you see on retro MTV from the early 90's.   The beats are sick if you're into electronic, break, rap and beats and the lights make you feel like you are 20 when MC hammer and Vanilla Ice still rocked a mic.  

The ship is cheaper for food, but if you're into electronic, house, or sexy house etc.. this is the place to be.  Don't expect good service, but do expect to pay cover, decent food pricing and good electro-house music.",1

17411,1,1550793600000,Tried this place over the weekend and I will definitely be coming back. While the restaurant itself seems a little outdated and dingy it makes up for it in service and food quality. Everyone working there was very courteous and friendly.,2
17411,3,1550534400000,"If you're looking for authentic Thai food in mid town Toronto, it's scarce and hard to come by but Mai Thai Restaurant is here to save the day. Now, I can't say 100% authentic, but at least 90% there which is as close as I've come in this neighbourhood. 

There are daily lunch specials for only $6.99 or $8.99 but the best way to order is definetely a la carte. The red beef curry is my favourite spicy dish and the cashew nut chicken dish is also great. The only thing on the menu I would call a bit over priced is the soup but they do offer a great selection.

If it's pad thai you seek, it's pretty good but not the best I've ever had. Unlike all other items on the menu, if you want it spicy, you have to make a special request and let them know you really do want it SPICY!!!

The only item that doesn't taste totally authentic to me, is the satay chicken. Rather than fulfilling the flavour that instantly comes to mind when I think of satay chicken, Mai Thai's satay tastes more like well cooked curry chicken.

Overall I would recommend the food at Mai Thai but if you only crave pad thai or satay chicken, be warned, they're not the best items on the menu and by that I mean they do taste good but not super authentic.

The restaurant is very nice on the inside, not quite fine dining  but almost, however it is not accessible you have to walk up a small flight of stairs to get in, strollers do not fit through the door well and once you're inside, the bathroom is up another flight of stairs. The service is also a little slow.",2

Took my dad her on his Vegas visit and we were seated in the corner room of their old place. There was a big party in the main room, but we were seated and then nobody even gave us menu's for 15 minutes and then after nobody else came over to take my order, I just flipped out on the idiot owners there. His lame apology was pathetic and I really wanted to punch him that night for sorta ruining the evening. Bootlegger Bistro saved the night.

royal no. 9- 5/5, has a floral taste, sometimes they make it super good and sometimes it's not as good but overall a cool floral flavour, prob my fav drink here

the alley trio- 4.5/5, comes with tapioca and pineapple jelly and another pink jelly, also interesting taste not necessarily your average milk tea taste, to me it also has a bit of floral taste but not as much as royal no. 9

drown a bear au lait- 2/5, not sure the exact name but it's basically a hot chocolate milk, really bitter tho. but it comes with a super cute chocolate bear that u dip into the drink, hence the name drown a bear haha

17449,2,1550707200000,"Review for the happy hour only:

2 1/2 stars... one for the service, one for the lettuce wraps and Mediterranean Chicken Pita, and a half star for the aquarium (which is amazing!). The rest is whatever.

My parents and wife really like this place but I am just not that convinced. The seats in their lounge area are super small, and the tables they have (not at the booth) are even smaller. We ordered 3 happy hour dishes and couldn't fit them on the table. I had to put my drink on the ground and eat from a small dish over my lap. The booths that we sit in sometimes are very comfortable and can hold enough appetizers for the four of us. But the ""table"" by the bar are meant more to set a few drinks down on and look at the aquarium. 

As mentioned above I only really like those apps. I have had the firecracker shrimp and don't think it is spicy enough to warrant ""firecracker"" in the title, and doesn't give off enough kim chee flavor. The prime rib sliders are good, but I am not a fan of the horseradish sauce. Way too much horseradish for my liking. The Humus platter is tasty, but... who goes anywhere just for the humus. 

Maybe I should come in and try the regular menu, but the happy hour is worth the price of drinks and a view of the aquarium. I will say that the $7 cocktails are all well made, and the servers are excellent! See you soon Golden Nugget... and maybe Chart House.",2

We go twice a month, on Wednesdays, to play free darts.  Lindsey is the bartender, and she couldn't be better.  Fast, friendly, and accommodating.  The crowd is varied and typically also very friendly.

17479,3,1550793600000,"We were having our quarterly sales meeting in July (hot!), and an escape room was a suggested team building activity (something indoors). I came across a few escape room options on Yelp, but the deciding factors for me to select Riddle Escape Room were:
- Ability and ease to book rooms online
- Available day/times (we needed to do this at 8pm on a Monday)
- Number of participants allowed in each escape room (we had 21 participants)

When booking appointments on their website, you have multiple rooms to choose from. What's nice is that their website states the difficulty level of each room, so you can book accordingly. Also, the max is 10 people per room/group via online booking. However, if you have a last-minute add (like we did), you can call and ask to add that person. If they say yet, then you can pay them upon check-in. The staff are friendly and accommodating, helping you with clues (when you get stumped), and may even snap a group photo once you have completed your mission. 

Our groups completed the ""FBI Interview"" and ""The Heist"" in 52 and 53 minutes, accordingly. It was fun and all members worked together to get it done in the given time frame of 60 minutes.

The place isn't hard to locate, and there is plenty of parking in the private strip mall lot. Another plus about this place is that the have time slots as late as 8:30pm, so you can work it into your schedule if you have dinner beforehand.",2

Tropical drinks & delicious food. As you walk in, you feel like you're on an island. Came here for happy hour with a girlfriend and it was both our first time here. We were seated outside, which by the way, wasn't really outside, just another room in the restaurant that had an outside vibe to it. 

We ordered lots of different appetizers and drinks since it was 50% off. We had the Jamaican wings, crab stack, seared ahi and firecracker shrimp. The Jamaican wings were so crispy and juicy. It was accommodated by a bbq sauce (5/5). The seared ahi was ok. It lacked a little flavor (2/5). The firecracker shrimp was the same. It was just a fried shrimp with a spicy mayo dipping sauce (3/5). But the crab stack was heaven!!!! It was mango and avocados with crab meat and shrimp with a sweet savory sauce. My mouth is drooling just thinking about it right now!!! (5/5) it is definitely a must try!! They use REAL crab meat. YUMMMMM

Our server/bartender I forgot to get his name... but he was great! He constantly checked up on us and was the one who actually recommended that delicious crab stack. I had no problems with him whatsoever. 

Good food & good service!!! A place worth trying. I will be back again for happy hour!!!",1

I was pleased with the banana nut muffin. When our entrees came, I was disappointed with the Corned Beef. It was dry and just not what I expected. It basically looked like the corned beef you get out of a can. The Country Fried Steak was good, but not blow your mind out of this world great.

Went last night with a friend, ordered a medium veggie pizza with two sodas. They took the pizza to our table and it was really good! Thin, crispy, and hot! An older gentleman took napkins, offered us cheese and pepper and put them on our table -without us having to ask. As well as refills. They seem to care about their customers. To be honest I love pizza and I've tried a lot but their pizza was good especially their crunchy crust. Not to mention that nothing was burned or over/under cooked either. Nice friendly & attentive :)",2

There is plentiful seating inside with a few tables outside the restaurant to look at the on goers.  There is also seating at the bar where you can see the sushi chefs prepare the fresh hand rolls.

The rock shrimp is one of my favorites, as well as the yellowtail sashimi. Both are appetizers that can be shared with another person. The shrimp came out hot and is crunchy and flavorful. The sashimi is a bit spicy with the sauce but it is a nice cut and very soft.

The price is a bit on the high end for sushi, but it tastes fresh and made to order. I'd recommend this restaurant to a group of girls for a night out or a date night.",2

Made bacon fried rice non-spicy fried rice for the kids.  One of the best fried rice I ever had!! Lots of oil/duck fat with fresh veggies.  

If I didn't eat the fries (way too salty) and bread, I would have enjoyed the meal more.  Note to self for every meal.  

I ordered the crispy rice w tuna tartare in top.  Yummy!  Would order again.

A few were a little bit - not so good, but at least they take risks and try things that most small companies pass on because they worry they audience wont come.  I live in LA now, but have gone back just to see a show playing there (Cherry Orchard). I probably wouid again. Don't be scared because of the sex shop outside. While there are some adult level shows, there are works of all kinds. Many times it would just bore the crap out of a child though.

I've brought both more modern second hand pieces with a vintage flair and older pieces here, including a 1950's pale blue day dress, and my latest find, a 1950's houndstooth dress that makes me look like Joan from Mad Men! 

There's a lot to look through (it's a pretty crammed space) but if you're looking for something specific, Cat really knows her stock and will search for pieces that meet your ideas. 

Some things are in better condition than others (as always with vintage) but the prices are really good, especially in comparison to some other vintage stores, and Cat will give you a discount if she has a piece that you want which will need repairs.",2

They stay stocked on the main items like milk, bread, butter, cheese. They offer a variety if fresh fruits and veggies. The meats & seafood are generally fresh. The bakery section is above board, as is the deli and hot order items! The sushi is fresh too! There are gourmet items and an aisle for ethnic foods. There's even a beauty section now selling brands like Philosophy. On the downside, I noticed that they'll stop carrying items without explanation, labeling it discontinued with a 50% discount. You could ask their buyer to carry items and they'd likely consider it. They also stopped making Gobs? Why? I don't know, but I loved their Gobs.

I am not writing about this branch specifically, I am writing about EVERY one I have been in within the last year or so. I have a business account here that has myself and my 2 other business partners on it. The only interaction I ever really need to have is depositing rent checks- that's it. It should be so simple, but for some reason it NEVER is! Whether I drive up or walk in, it is by far the longest deposit process of any bank I have ever been to. For reals, it takes me about 5-7 minutes (yes I have timed it) once I am at the teller window. 

So today, I walk in and hand over my check and my slip. After a looooong pause (and way more typing than I believe is required to process my deposit) she asks me to confirm my home address, NOT the business address on the account. I do it, realizing later that I just confirmed some marketing departments opportunity to flood me with crap mail. Then she asks me to confirm my name... yes my name. I do it. She then asks me to sign the check right below where I have clearly written ""For Deposit Only"" and the account number. I do it. Looooooooong pause........ more typing.

The buffet is ok...I would not pay to go unless I got 2 for 1. GVR and M are way better but the price is much lower here. Its a decent place to go if your there anyways.

I heard Michaels restaurant is suppose to be amazing! I have never tried it but out love too eventually. Maybe on our next free stay-cation.

Also, I am a big fan of their spa as well. They have great locals discounts (usually %20 off Sund- Thurs). They use to have juice and coffee out for you to drink but now you have to ask for it. I guess that they said their staff was stealing it over night....still I like when you use to be able to just get them as you liked.

My husband is a big fan of spicy foods so he always gets the diablo ship pasta and my favorite dish is the pesto penne bake (no meat added).  The portions are pretty big so bring your appetite, a buddy, or get a box to eat your leftovers for the next lunch & dinner.  If you really want to go full-force on the pig out scale, I recommend the guaca-tony appetizer as well.

The staff is always super friendly, but it does get really busy for dinner.  Our tactic for Oregano's is to skip lunch then head to an early dinner at 4 to stuff our faces and miss the crowd.  Then you can roll yourself home with plenty of time to sit on the couch and talk about how full you are for the next three hours.

The parking is really easy and the place is easy to find.  If you have a group of more than 5 you might need to call or plan ahead if reservations are allowed.  The vibe is really fun and casual and the patio is the best place to sit when the weather won't melt you into your seat.

I'd discovered their Instagram feed a little while ago and had been drooling over it for months. Every vegan knows about banana soft serve or 'nice cream', it's one of my go-to breakfasts so I was interested to try it as more of a dessert-type treat. The shop was a lot smaller than I expected, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I had to pay for street parking (luckily it wasn't too much). The interior of this place is absolutely adorable. I took a while to decide what I wanted but ended up deciding on an affogato cone. The first thing I noticed was the size - the amount of ice cream I received was nothing like the pictures I'd seen on their Instagram page. My tiny cone cost me $6.75. If I were to make the exact thing at home it would cost me less than a dollar. Of course, I wouldn't be as opposed to spending that much had the quality or amount of ice cream been up to expectations but it just wasn't anything special.

The inside is very nice (not really what you'd expect in a pizza joint)- red/white checker topped tables, surrounded by framed pictures of New York City points of interest (bridge) and old-time celebs (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin) on all the walls. There is a small bar. Also, there is seating al frasco, too. In one corner, there is a round table for a cozy get-together.

The service is pretty good- the staff is nice and friendly. The atmosphere is nice. It's a little small (but there is also seating at the Bar, and al fresco, too). The pizza is pretty good- thin crust, good sauce, good cheese. My husband & I shared a pie (had leftovers). I think, maybe, my husband (who is half Italian) thought it was good, but not spectacular. At the time, the baby wasn't eating too many solids, so we didn't share our meal with him. Funny story: the baby was having his bottle and he ended up falling asleep at the table, in the highchair.
 
About the Menu, choose the item and size- personal, small, large (pizza, calzone) and then select your toppings (which takes up half the menu- meats, veggies, extra sauce, basil, garlic, etc.).

Imagine a fusion of Polynesian-spam-based lunchroom, Korean kim chee joint and basic Chinese restaurant. Usually, when we hear ""Korean,"" it's some sort of Asian BBQ joint. Not this place.
Upon sitting down, you will get a number of different pickle-type appetizers. We got two types of kim chee, kelp noodle in a mayonnaise sauce that was quite new and tasty, boiled peanuts, and bean sprouts in brine.
We ordered the pan-fried dim sum and it was adequate.
We ordered the fried chili shrimp and the meat-and-seafood stir fry. 
The waiter warned us that the stir fry was the real deal, with sea cucumbers (sort of a cross between mushrooms and squid, but slimy). And indeed it had sea cucumbers, but nice enoki mushrooms too. I'm honestly not a huge fan of sea cucumbers but as the wait dude promised, they help make a nice gravy.
Both dishes had a mix of fresh vegetables and that staple of Polynesian/Chinese lunchrooms, mixed frozen vegetables of cut string beans, corn, cubed carrot and peas. I put that mix in canned chicken noodle soup to increase the nutrition content, but otherwise don't see much advantage to adding frozen mixed vegetables to real food.

She helped us to order food but it took another 15 minutes to arrive and she never showed up again for a long long time. We didn't get water, plates or napkins. We went and got our own drinks at the bar again. We got napkins from the bar.  There were very few people in the restaurant and the service is completely unacceptable!!. There was no manager on duty or the manager was watching a game probably with some drinks. 
The waitress show up when it is time for check. She told us that we don't need to pay for drinks and she apologized us for poor service. We paid the check and ready to leave then the Bartender came with a check and our main waitress vanished. There was no training or minimal training provided to the staff here.

I nicely mentioned my experience, and asked for a refund for my bad food. You Replied:

Jon,
 After investigation we are unable to grant your request. We are disappointed that we did not fulfill your dining expectations here at Jacksons-Restaurant-Bar. If I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to call.

Paul S. Bazzano

Paul, appreciate the investigation, exactly what was investigated, can you detail for me.  As I said service excellent, I tipped well, 2 Cheese plates good, food not so good. Is that all?  Frankly, I had a good time.  I am not asking for much, except a refund for the meals. If these are your thoughts on the matter, service and quality count. I will never eat there again nor could I by conscience stay at that Hilton again, nor could I recommend to any that it is worth the time or money. I work for a large company in the area, oil and gas, what should I say... stay at the Hilton and get MC D's to go, you will enjoy more than Jacksons. Marketing is everything, I'd prefer a refund of the money, for the meals, simple and easy.  Cook had a hangover.., bad day...?  Happens.  Your Thoughts please, and normally I do not bitch, but the truth is, meals bad.
I appreciate your time- Jon

Never heard another word",2
17746,1,1550275200000,"I came to eat here based on the menu. I didn't realize it was a Kimpton restaurant, attached to the Palomar hotel. I'm a fan of Kimpton hotels, so I was delighted to learn it was one of their restaurants. The place is really cool - it's got a 20s speakeasy - library lounge type of look to it. The bartenders are even dressed the part. 

I didn't have drinks here, just food. This place is like a gastropub, so everything on the menu sounded amazing. I ordered the deviled eggs, the tater tots, and the tagliatelle. The deviled eggs were all right - there was bacon mixed in with the yolk. Not the best deviled eggs I've ever had. The tater tots were good - they also had bacon inside and the inside had a very hash browny texture. It came with a dipping sauce, but that tasted weird. The tagliatelle pasta had roasted squash, wild mushrooms, in the sauce was a walnut pesto. It sounded amazing on paper, but this tasted really weird. And there was too much sauce that overpowered the pasta noodles and the squash and the mushrooms. I didn't really like it and wouldn't order it again. 

Overall the food was just okay - it didn't amaze me. The food sounded good in theory on paper, and the presentation was really nice, but the taste and quality weren't enough to make me want to return. The service was good though. The hostess was really nice and friendly. The bartenders were adequate. And the food came out quickly. The best part of this place is the look of the interior.",3

Barista was friendly, helpful, and informative. The coffee was excellent (had the Puerto Verte). All are medium to light roasted. The slower speed of service seemed to be a product of brewing to order.

This is the first valley location and of course I was very skeptical they could make a true Chicago deep dish here in Phoenix.
Anyway, we had a large group and were seated outside on the patio. Drinks came slowly most of the night but, we were here for pizza so not a deal breaker.
I know deep dish takes time 45 minutes or so and since we ordered several pies I knew it would take longer. After an hour passed, the pizza made it to our tables and looked great. We ordered mushroom and sausage on one and pepperoni on another. Even got a thin crust for the kids.
Overall, the pizza was cheesy goodness. I would say very good but, the canned mushrooms were a bit rubbery and were a bummer. Sausage was great, pepperoni too. Even the thin pizza was tasty.
Service was steady and friendly but, a bit slow at times - especially drinks - may be that's the bartenders fault but, all we ordered was beer, wine or soda - nothing should take 15 minutes to get there when the place is half empty.
Yes, I would eat here again. It's a fair try at a Chicago classic but, there are better even in the valley. Personally, I like to get my deep dish fix when I visit chi-town in the summer.",2

Lastly my kids of course leave their floaties and get off the phone with lost and found and WE have to pay for the items robbed shipped. I've stayed and Cesar's hotels several times and forgot bathing suits etc and they always ship my items free of charge.

I've wracked my brains for a fitting analogy and that's the closest I can come. (Pun intended.) 

Today I had lunch here with a friend. Between the two of us, we had two rolls of tuna and salmon nigiri, a large bowl of miso soup, a salad, the most beautifully prepared grilled black cod glazed with some special exotic sauce I've ever tasted in my life, and a beef stir fry to top it all off. We basically stuffed our fat faces full of mind-blowing, top notch Japanese cooking, and what did the total bill come to? 39 stinking bucks, before tip. 

That, folks, is obscene. It's a gross violation of any community's decency standards. It's so good you'll need to keep looking around to make sure no one's watching as you indulge. When the bill came (pun intended), I was reminded of when a buddy and I were little kids and discovered a secret stash of Playboy magazines in the park behind my house. As we devoured the delightful visions we'd never seen before with our rapacious, prepubescent eyes, we knew we had to get the hell out of there soon because surely this was too good to be true and some freak was going to pounce on us any minute.

Recommend:
Peanut like flavored curry with chicken.  

NOT Recommended:
* I was not a fan of the papaya salad, it was overly drenched with prominent fish sauce and it seemed as though the salad may have been sitting out for a long while. Typically fresh Thai papya salad is firm, crisp...this lacked that.  

* The Pad See Ew: noodle dish that has a charred sauce flavor was lacking in the sauce and the garnishment of peanuts.  I had the beef and it was dry, tough and had hard sinew. It was not at all appetizing and the noodles typically with this dish is a rice noodle that is flat, long, wide and absorbs and retains the sauce. This noodle was cut up in like 1 inch or less lengths, it did the opposite affect.

* Rice with the order was also underdone.

I LOVE authentic Thai food and Siam Thai underwhelmed in authenticity, portion size is very small, including the meat servings you may get 2-3  bits of meat/shrimp.",1

17880,3,1550448000000,"COX Cable in the Phoenix, AZ area advertises low rates if the consumer commits to a 2-year contract. What they don't tell you is that just because you commit at one rate doesn't mean they won't change the terms of the agreement and increase the rate.

In March 2017, I signed up with COX Cable for internet and TV services. The FIXED 2-year rate was supposed to be $129.99 per month. When I agreed to this service I assumed that my cable and internet service would stay the same (content and cost) until the end of February 2019. WRONG!

In agreeing to this plan, I also signed up for electronic statements and automatic payments. One less thing to worry about. The payments would be made automatically. COX got paid and I would have uninterrupted service. Perfect, right? 

In August 2017, I received an email from COX telling me that my account was more than $249.63 past due. To make a very long and crazy story shorter, when I called them to find out what the problem was they told me that the campaign I signed up for in March had ended in May 2017 and my cable bill is now $218.00 per month.  Yes, almost a $100.00 more per month.

I was informed that the potential for the increase was explained in the monthly statement. Admittedly I had not been looking at the statements. I saw that the payments were made (alerted by my bank) and I knew I had an agreement with them for the fixed cost until February 2019.

This practice seems very deceptive and unfair. How can it be legal, fair, or, appropriate for COX to be able to change an agreement and be allowed to raise the cost of service that much.

COX won't tell people but maybe you can. If I can find another service I will say good-bye to COX. If for no other reason their unethical and unfair practices.",2

Actually I ordered from them one the 4th of July and had a decent experience but this time my sister ordered the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. She ate it but was mildly disappointed and I ordered the orange chicken and chow mein. I hate the way they make orange chicken taste and the chow mein was 100% inedible. It tasted like 2 week old rewarmed food. I threw it up the second it entered my mouth. Sorry I would highly recommend avoiding this place altogether even if you've bought from them before.,2

They have a short cocktail list with a few beers and wines.  The decor is quite eclectic with Royal Doulton-esque figurines along the wall. The open kitchen is in the middle of the kitchen.

Started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes topped with a too-tart red pepper, feta and corn chutney. 

Next was the Avocado in Jicama - pureed avocado that's perfectly seasoned and sprinkled with fried tortilla bits in a Tostitos Scoops like jicama.  Delicious!

For our daily veggie intake we opted for the Kale Salad with toasted pine nuts, raisins, Ricotta Salata. This was topped with a fried quail egg that could've used some seasoning. The salad overall was enjoyable.

For our main we shared the Paella del Carmen - scallops, clams, mussels, shrimp, chicken and chorizo. No regrets here! Loved scraping up the rice crust from the bottom of the pan and the chicken and sausage fats really flavored the dish nicely.  The seafood was cooked perfectly - not one thing was overcooked.

The coffee was amazing - Bouchon has their own Bouchon house blend that is way better than Starbucks. Our meal also started with some bread and butter/jam, which was very nice!",2
17960,2,1550448000000,"This buffet was a disappointment.  Their weekend seafood dinner prices are $31.95 per person, as of October of 2015.  Since we were staying at Treasure Island, part of their resort fees includes a 2 for 1 voucher at their buffet, so we decided to try out their buffet. 

We stopped by here around 6:30pm and there was a very long line.  Since we had a late lunch, we figured we'll come back here about 9pm, giving us an hour before they closed.

I assumed that the reason the buffet wasn't that good was that we came here at an unpopular time, which was a Sunday night with less than an hour before they closed.  The problems I had was that when we got here at 9:15pm, there was still a long line to get into the buffet.  Looking inside, there was a lot of empty available tables. Most of them were cleaned off too. The line went fairly quickly, but by the time they seated us, it was already after 9:30pm.

They did tell us that they closed at 10pm and the food will be removed by then. After we were seated, the hostess sat us at a very tiny table. There were a lot of other larger cleaned off empty tables. When we asked the hostess if we could just sit at another table.., she told us that we would have to stand in a corner and wait for another table. We had less than 30 minutes before they take the food away, so we decided to just sit at the tiny table.

When we were getting the food, you can tell that a lot of the food have been sitting out for quite a while. The prime rib were dry, the avocado were darkened, etc. They also weren't clearing the tables as frequently as it got closer to 10pm. Afterwards.., when it was 10:30pm, they told us the time and that we had to leave now. So by the time we sat down, we had less than 1 hour to eat. If we paid full price, this place would be a 1-star review.

I would image that if we came here early in the evening, the food would be better and so would their service; although I would never pay full price for this buffet. I would give this place another try with a 2 for 1 voucher, but I would come here at a better time.",2

17965,3,1550102400000,"Came here for my friend's bachelor party this past weekend after reading the Yelp reviews. I made a reservation less than a week in advance for 18 and they happily accommodated us. 

Food is on point, good for sharing and hogging alike.  Drinks, the sake bombs especially, are legit.  We avoided the specialty cocktails as our waitress said they were very sweet, but the beers and run-of-the-mill cocktails (jack and coke, gin and tonic, etc.) were nice. 

Waitresses were in plaid skirts which, for a bachelor party of 18 was... Well, y'know. 

Don't think a single one of us had a complaint about the food, drinks, or service.  Oh, and they were nice enough to split our enormous bill for each of us based on what we ordered!

17975,3,1550275200000,"Came here back in June for the Britney Spears concert with my daughter. Not the best accoustics, but still a fairly nice venue. This was the most bizarre concert I've ever attended. It's not the venue's fault, but it was a weird experience. We sat in the unfixed seats in the back, just above the first level. An older couple sat next to us because the wife used a cane. First of all, I thought I would have been the oldest person there, I'm 41, but this couple was in their mid to late sixties. I heard the man tell his wife to sit the f*ck down...nice guy, right? During the opening act & the Nicki Minaj portion of the concert, he kept looking through his binoculars at them...EW. Then Britney came out. He danced as well as he could being old, white & sitting down. Again, he ogled Britney & her dancers through his binocs. Some poor girl had the misfortune of walking past then stopping in front of them on the walkway just above the top row of seats in the lower section. They yelled at her and told her to, ""Get the f*ck out of the way!!"". She left, quite bewildered at being verbally assulted by a couple of old geezers at a Britney Spears concert. The part of Britney's show came in which she asks a male member of the audience to come on stage and dance with her. The fool old man was waving his hand wildly in the air, like a the kiss-ass smart kid in your elementary school class kind of hand raising! Fortunately for everyone in that arena, she picked a younger, better looking man....phew! About 10 minutes later, a group of 4 girls decided they wanted to dance where the first girl had earlier got her ass verbally handed to her by Mr. & Mrs. Hemorrhoid.  Again, they yelled obscenities at the girls, he pushed one of them and the wife was pushing them with her cane! The girls asked my daughter & I if we minded if they moved in front of us. We told them it was fine, we could still see just fine. Then one of the girls told the man that it was not OK to hit a woman. He says, ""I didn't hit you, I pushed you!""...wow. Sorry girls, he's taken!",2
17976,2,1550016000000,"For the last several years I have Religiously come to the Downtown Terrace at the container park almost 2 to 4 times per month for its brunch.

Never understood why they never had brunch throughout the week to maximize there best food.     
Well today one of my favorite places has change forever and for the worse.  instead of trying to renegotiate a better lease to cut costs and open for better hours or add a food truck to maximize profits. The owners stupidly have become a cost cutting disappointment, portions cut, food on paper and plastic and almost no staff. What a total shame best food in town killed by bad money management, followed by even more stupid decisions to try and fix it.

17977,1,1550707200000,"Bring your floaties! 

I came here last weekend for the first of many, ""Road to Life is Beautiful"" concert series. I'm not a huge fan of Matisyahu, but I wanted to check out the pool and have a few cocktails with friends. 

This place seems to vary from the loud DJ pumping pool party scene to a mellow cocktail soaked nap in the sun. Check the website before you arrive to make sure the vibe is right for you and your party. This night the vibe moved at the pace of reggae, oddly I be into it mon!  

This pool is broken in two wading pools with a bar in the middle. You will have to get out of the pool to get a new drink, but I would use this chance to pee in the toilet instead of constantly peeing in the public swimming hole. There's plenty of cabanas for rent and an abundance of free lounge chairs for you to relax on - bonus this pool gets tons of sunlight from the mid-morning all the way to about 6pm. 

If there's a DJ playing, you'll most likely have to pay to get in, but I would call first, this will save you time and money.",2
17980,1,1550275200000,"Cute place, great decor, but the cupcakes are rather dry, not a lot of taste and the frosting is flavorless. I really love cupcakes in general but my homemade cupcakes and frosting from a box mix are superior. 

I would avoid lemon definitely. No detectable lemon at all in cake or frosting. The Guinness one was unique but not a lot of Guinness flavor (good cocoa though) and nothing in frosting.   We purchased a six pack with friends and most said that the baileys Irish cream one was the best but I didn't try after less than stellar first two attempts. 

I would recommend skipping here and saving your calories for grandma Frieda's cupcakes in the west side market. If you still want to try these, go for the unique flavors and skip the basics.",2
17981,2,1549238400000,"Small place. Very warm on a cool day (feels like 7 degrees right now, supposedly). My glasses fogged.

Not as many flavors/types of drinks as ten ren, tea shop, real fruit, etc. No food on the menu. Drinks start at $4.10 for a medium (not including toppings).

Couple of small tables with seating. 

Toppings are $0.50 each - include things like regular boba, small boba (a plus for me), red bean, pudding, ice cream, lychee jelly, aloe, etc.

Customization: less ice, less sugar, etc.

Had: Medium (they don't have a small size) brown rice with less ice and mini pearls/small boba. Total cost was $5.10. Tastes delicious. Nice and creamy. Strong brown rice taste. Mini pearls are delightful. Still chewy, not soggy, but also completely cooked through.

It's also quite difficult for them to get your order wrong because your order is printed onto a sticker they place on your cup.

Nice service too. I failed at getting my straw in and made a bit of a mess. Lady gave me a napkin and helped me clean up my cup. 

Amusing note. They have a tiny Lost and Found container. Today, it had mascara in it.

Small note of concern: There was a small pill bug crawling on the wall. Thankfully, not close to any of the drinks or drink making area, but still not fun to see when you're having drinks.",2
17983,3,1549152000000,"Overall, this is an enjoyable festival where there is something for everyone.

While this is branded as an Arts Festival, it could also be called a music festival.  There are hundreds of artists selling their wares, but there are also four stages packed with entertainment.  The music choices range from blue grass to hip hop, folk to rock and roll and it is almost non stop between the different stages.  

A lot of the artwork is out of most people's budgets, but there is a nice mix of art that you can purchase for under $50 as well.  The range of items for sale is typical of most art festivals - paintings, photography, pottery and jewelry.  One of the more unique (and affordable) vendors was the chinese paper cutter.  For $1 per letter, he cut your name and your name in Chinese out of paper and included a mat!  It was an affordable and very unique gift.  

There is also a great variety of food.  Everything from traditional cotton candy and corn dogs to lobster burgers.  I sampled the lobster burger and it was very tasty.  Like any festival, though, the food can be pricey.  

One of the nice features of the festival is that there are several free water stations around.  the day I was there it was sunny and in the 80s, so this was a life saver.

Overall, a very enjoyable event.  If you are easily swayed or tempted by beautiful artwork or tasty eats, it might be a good idea to leave the wallet at home so all you can do is browse.",2
17988,1,1549756800000,"This place has the ""restaurant"" side that's family friendly, and a ""bar"" side.

They have their own special drinks there, and I forgot what my boyfriend and i ordered, but they were both pretty damn good. My bf and I both got a sampler plate that had 4 different types of sandwiches and their shoe string fries. Fries were bomb, and the sandwiches were all pretty good too except the PIna Colada chicken. It was too sweet and just had a weird taste. The Mushroom Chicken sandwich was to die for!

We left and later came back to see if we were able to buy a yard, but I guess they're only sold at Harrah's now, so we bought a half yard. The bartender that made it for us hooked it up!! 10 shots of tequila, 10 shots of I think it was Midori? All for $28 bucks! She topped it off with some Monster because I was feeling a little tired because I didn't sleep that much the night before, and she told us her shift ends at 5 PM so if we came back in time, she would refill out half yard for $10!

The bartenders also do ""shows"" with the shaker & liquor bottles. Throwing them around in the air and shit. Pretty cool to watch.",2

I started searching for a place to go in YELP and found this place: QC reflexology

Called the number and a friendly guy took my appointment; same day; within 30 minutes ! :-)) He also asked if I wanted a female or male and I said I would like a female. Still uncomfortable with guys touching my back and legs ... I know ... I know :-))

I got to the location and they had me fill out a form, I never had to do back in Chicago.
Basically, it was asking if I had any Health problems and in what areas you would like them to work on.

After few minutes, they led me to this ""room"" where Tina did her magic. I knew it was magic because as soon as she started to work on my arms, I fell asleep. I do not remember most of the massage as I was asleep

Tina told me later that I was funny, when asked why. She said I would snore while she was working on me but as soon as she stops, I get very quiet.

This much I know, my fellow YELPERS, I will be going back to QC reflexology next month and I hope Tina will be working on that day.

There's really not a bad seat in the house since it's not that large of an arena and I've been satisfied sitting on both the lower and upper levels. It really depends on how the stage is set up. Sound quality is ok...if you're here for a concert, sometimes the music can be so loud that you can't hear the lyrics unless the performer is shouting into the mic.

The staff and ushers are generally pretty helpful and security isn't too much of a hassle. Concession prices are pretty standard and a rip off like any other arena, although beers aren't too bad @ $8.50 each. My only gripe is that there is only one exit so it takes forever to get out of the arena after an event is over! Parking at MGM is also a big hassle if there's an event going on in the arena, especially during fight nights.

The aesthetician proceeds to do my ""bikini"" wax and then asks me if I want to upgrade to a FULL bikini wax!  HUH?!  I didn't ask for a HALF bikini wax!  What they call a bikini wax covers about 1"" of the hair in the bikini area and in NO way would allow a woman to wear a bikini.  Maybe a boyshort, grandma style of bikini but NOT a real bikini.

However, in my experience, I found the people working there to be very demanding and the business in general to be extremely money hungry. They're not lenient towards their clients, there's plenty of non rudimentary instructions you must follow with this studio, then, you must show up at least 10 minutes early to every class, you have to sign up online in order to have a guaranteed spot, and lastly, it's NOT a very welcoming studio. This, in particular, makes me extremely frustrated going through this process every time I go to the studio.

I mean they give you French fries instead of bread- what's not to like? That being said I would say my experience at the Vegas restaurant was slightly worse than in DC or SF but I am a Niles Crane-esque nitpicker so don't let that deter you. Also, Stripsteak is in the Mandalay Bay which makes it a bit easier to get a table/reservation on the weekends as its not nearly as popular a hotel as it once was (something that also lends to the Border Grill brunch). There are like 3 negative reviews where the people say "" I can make food better than this""- I'm not sure if they all climbed out of the same clown car together but if they can actually make better food they are in the wrong industry. 


The Steak

I always get a bone in ribeye when I first go to a steak place as a basis of comparison with other restaurants. The ribeye here is a bit smaller than usual (18 oz vs usual 22 or more) and I actually think the meat was a little tastier. The steak had been trimmed a little more than I would like (fat= flavor) but it didn't seem to have negatively affected the steak. The curst was nice and salty- good. Medium rare was a deep red-good. The price (59$) is pretty average for Vegas steak joints on the strip. My dining companion got the Waygu  vs Waygu entree and that was fantastic- probably what I will get the next time I go (although bacon rapped veal is pretty enticing as well) 

The Sides

Some people, after eating 2 lbs of French fries, might think ""You know what; I probably don't need another potato side"". We call those people losers. The reason these underhumans won't be dining with me is because Stripsteak has a little something called the Potato Puree Trio- much like the fires it delivers 3 different kinds of potato including one that is pureed with lobster. Perhaps I am a philistine but the lobster potatoes were actually freaking awesome. I know it probably shouldn't be done, I know it's probably not the choicest lobster bits but jesus... it is good. 

The mac and cheese- I also always get this when available my first time at a steak place and this one did not disappoint. It was quite ""crusty"" with lots of bits on top which I like. The mac itself was perhaps a little dry but I would rather that than have it swimming. 

Broccolini- had a very nice amount of garlic flavor which made this usually inedible weed actually taste pretty good.",2

I've been waiting for a long time for Side Bar to open, and it was worth the wait. It's a tiny space that fills up quickly, but it's very chic without being pretentious. The wine list is good, with a nice variety, but the pours are pretty chintzy. The beer selection is decent too, but I think $5 is a bit high for beers as commonplace as Newcastle. They also have a full bar with a better selection than most bars- lots of whiskey and flavored vodka that you won't find in many bars.

I wish however that they had an eggplant dish but nonetheless i would still opt to go here!

OK so apparently I started this review a year ago, but I would like to add that nothing has changed over the past year I have come here numerous times. Kind of funny and yet creepy but my name must pop up in their computer when I call because they know my name (think ""Norm"" from Cheers - and yes I realize I am dating myself).

18237,3,1551225600000,"I used Opentable app to make reservations for dinner. This was my first dinner at the Bouchon Las Vegas Restaurant and it was absolutely wonderful. 

The restaurant is hidden on the second floor of the Venetian. You have to walk to the check-in area, take the elevator to the second floor. Then take a left when exiting the elevator. Apparently, there is a sign, but it isn't very noticeable. 

The order was:
* Oysters on half shell $18 and Clams $1.95 each. There were multiple oyster choices to choose from, but at the end, we choose kumamotos. The oysters were small, sweet, fresh, but I really didn't like their condiment choices. It was either ketchup or balsamic vinegar. I would have preferred some mignonette dressing and/or tabasco sauce and/or raw horseradish. Clams were also sweet and fresh. No complaints there.
* Steak Frites $36.75 (4 of 5) - pan-seared prime flatiron, caramelized shallots & maître d hôtel butter, served with French fries. Traditional steak and fries done perfectly.
* Gnocchi à la Parisienne $26.75 (5 of 5) - sautéed gnocchi, with a fricassée of garden vegetables & brown butter sauce. Amazing!!! The gnocchi tasted like clouds. It was light when you bit into it but heavy tasting in the belly because of the butter sauce. The complimenting vegetables were tasty and balanced with the gnocchi perfectly.
* Sole Marinière $36.75 (4 of 5) - sautéed fillet of sole, caramelized baby artichokes,
 Manila clams, oyster mushrooms, & coco beans.  The sole was delicious pan fried. It had a crispy outer layer and a soft inner layer. The sole was fresh and very tasty. 
* Moules au Tolouse $28.75 (4 of 5) - Maine bouchot mussels steamed with white wine, Tolouse sausage & tomato oil. The mussels were fresh. The mussels were steamed in a strong white sauce. I absolutely adored the pot it was served-in. There was a metal mesh on one corner of the pot and you could dip your bread into that corner, without brushing the mussels to the side. It was a minor detail, but it was obviously very useful. Rather than having to take all the mussels out or finishing the mussels to get to the white sauce, Bouchon created a nook to dip the bread. And, it doesn't hurt, their complimentary bread, is none other than, their popular Epi Baguette. Yeah for free yummy bread.

I actually like Bouchon Las Vegas more than Bouchon Yountville. I like their restaurant spacing & menu selections in Las Vegas. If you are in the neighborhood of Las Vegas strip, I strongly recommend brunch or dinner at Bouchon.",2

Smallest size gelato gets you 2 flavors for $5. Medium is 3 flavors for $6.50 and large is $7.50. They have crepes here too, but sweet crepe only comes with nutella and bananas, no gelato unless you request an add-on for extra $.

Pros- lots of vegan flavors! The entire front row in fact is dairy free! This includes dark chocolate and coconut flavors. Some of the fruit flavors contain tiny bits of real fruit.

Cons- Generic flavors that are way too sweet! Pricy. They don't accept credit if order is under $10, but debit is fine. Only 2 tables for seating inside and none outside. Also- you will be charged $1 if you sample without purchasing, omg be careful!

The place has around 20 seats, with modern designs and a spacious waiting area for collecting food and drink orders. The menu is smaller than other places such as Chatime but not overwhelming. 

I ordered the earl grey lightbulb milktea for around 5.20 and a matcha waffle with matcha ice cream for 6.50 (they ran out of original waffle that night). They give you a little buzzer that goes off when your order is ready. 

The milktea tasted alright, its not worth it for the price vs the amount of bubbletea you actually get, its definitely a gimmick. As for the matcha waffle, i actually enjoyed it and could taste the matcha flavour pretty well. 

Overall, the visit wasn't a bust but it wasn't something memorable. I can't see much reason to visit beyond the aesthetic appeal of the lightbulb bubble tea.",2

Now about the food. I heard so much about this place even after hours of failed attempt to order online, I decided to go there and eat. I went on Friday night, not too smart right? Waited 30 min and sat.

I ordered the large meat meat that I failed to get online (cause I'm stupid). I also ordered beer and Italian salad (fam style).

The pizza was amazing. What you read is true, fresh delicious, amazing. I will order that again. One piece is a meal. There is like 8 slices on a large. You are packing that home.

I did not like the salad, just not to my taste. I won't order that again. Also small for a family salad size. Would feed 4 easy. So maybe I'm too picky.

I gave the place four stars cause the salad was not fantastic. If I was rating the pizza alone 5 star.

no
yes 

Nothing about the food here.

I have heard how good this place is. So I ordered online the meat meat large deep dish. These take an hour to cook.

I drive 40 min to pick up my pizza, the staff is too busy to assist me right away, too busy talking to other waiters. The place was only 25% full at12:55 on 2-17. Waited 5 min for help. She looks up my order and they don't have an order in the system.

When I ordered online it gave a pick up time and payment amount to pay cash at the store.

She offered to make a pizza but that's an hour wait and 40 back home. So I declined.

If you order online, better call them and verify the order.

We all ordered the hashbrowns crispy, now that usually means a little more crispy than soft... My husbands and my sons hash browns came out burnt to a crisp! It was awful! And my husbands eggs were slightly overcooked. My poached eggs were more like barely cooked eggs, they were pretty much inedible unless I'm trying to drink my eggs like I'm in a rocky movie...

When I got to the Foreign Exchange Centre, they were secretive about their exchange rate (they would not display the buy and sell rate). The clerk (who was an older cranky lady) told me that she would exchange 10,000 yen for 90 CAD. WHAT A RIPOFF. I had to check with her three times because I could not believe what I was hearing. She refused to write it down on paper for me. 

I understand that they have to make money by charging fees but I would have lost 40 CAD for every 10,000 yen I exchanged. That's almost a THIRD of what you are exchanging. How unethical and gross. I was planning on exchanging 88000 yen that day, which was worth 1144 CAD in the market.

Small spaces, tight turns ( actually saw a bus go up on island to turn down lane, tight to back up. Seriously get a better designer for the next one. I do like the shade area and benches are a nice touch",1
18321,3,1549065600000,Gross dirty place. Customer service was so bad I could not believe that they are affiliated with American Express. Unbelievable that Amex would call these people a partner. Time to step up their game or separate from Amex Platinum.,2

18323,2,1550620800000,"I'm actually shocked by the lack of professionalism and horrible customer service I have received from the grooming salon on multiple occasions. The store is great, the employees are helpful, the vet is absolutely amazing, but the grooming salon is a complete disaster in my opinion. This is now the second time we've had problems with the groomers so I'll go into a little detail for both.

First time: booked an appt for my 2 puppies a week ahead of time. Went in, dropped my dogs off and was told to pick them up in about 5 hours cause they were very booked. I came and picked them up 5.5 hours later and was told one of my dogs hadn't been trimmed yet and it would just be a few minutes. So they put him on the table to start grooming and in walks a woman with her dog wanting a walk-In service (nail trim). The groomer says to me, ""we will take care of your dog after we take care of this nail trim."" I said ""well we had an appointment almost 6 hours ago so no I don't think that we should have to wait for a walk in."" So I'm thinking why in the world would a walk in get priority over someone in the middle of their already dragged out appointment? What if I had to be at work or had something to take care of and was now late due to them setting me back 1.5 hours? Anyways, one of the dog groomers in the back just says ""whatever I'll just do it, you do the nail trim"". As if it was so difficult for her to DO HER JOB THAT SHE IS ON THE CLOCK FOR ANYHOW. So we went to a more boutique grooming salon where we got much better quality service at a slightly higher price...

Now
Second time: the boutique style salon we went to charged $35 for a full puppy groom. Petsmarts website charges $18.99 for a puppy groom. So we decided to save a few bucks and give petsmart a second chance. Horrible choice. I got the appt last minute which was nice of them and they finished the groom earlier than expected. So I was slightly impressed. They also reduced the price for our girl dog because she wasn't getting a haircut. When we were dropping them off the groomer asked if we wanted additional services. We said can we do a nail grind? She says ""yes, it'll only be 6$ instead of 12$ cause petsmart still considers dogs their age as puppies."" We said great, and left. So upon arrival, we get the invoice and it totals out to be nearly 80$. Now I'm not an accountant or mathematician but I am fairly certain 18$ + the 9-12$ for our girl dog + $12 for both nail grinds is no where near $80. So I asked the cashier if she could explain. She couldn't. So she asked her manager to come up and asked her to explain. She couldn't either. I asked THE WOMAN WHO RANG US UP to explain. SHE couldn't. So I go back and try to speak to the salon manager.  The salon manager acts as if she has no idea what we were talking about and tells us because our puppies are a certain age they charged full price. Now, if you recall, I was told EXPLICITLY AND VOLUNTARILY by the woman who rang us up that our dogs were considered puppies by petsmart. So you can understand my confusion because I was under the impression that I purchased two puppy grooms + 2 nail grinds (total value = $48). Now, whether or not my dogs were too old or too young for their rules, I was told specifically that they were receiving puppy grooms. If I would have known I was being charged $35 each instead of 18$ in the first place, I surely would have gone to the boutique salon that actually cares about my pets and isn't manipulative or shady in their prices. I am very disappointed that no one in upper management at this location had any resolution to this ridiculous up charge or even the sincerity to apologize for their mistake. I still paid the full $80 because it got to the point where id rather them take my money than have to listen to the salon manager lie through her teeth to defend this mistake.

NOT TO MENTION THE JOB THEY DID ON MY DOGS.

my dogs are Maltese/havenese. Havenese are known for their silky soft fur. My boy has super soft curly hair and the girl has thin silky hair. NOW both my dogs are matted with what looks like fried electrocuted straight hair. My boy doesn't have straight hair but they managed to overbrush and frizz his hair to the point where I questioned whether this was even my dog. Of course I know they will look different with a cut, as I have had them cut before. But this was just straight lack of professional judgement by the groomer. Maybe if I had asked her to poof my boys hair like an Afro or lose his curls I would applaud her, but I didn't. I simply asked for a very minimal trim around his eyes so he could see. 


I will never ever be back to the grooming salon at this petsmart.",2

We had been sent a 20% off coupon and hub was dying to try this....so off we went on a Monday night around 5pm.
Our waitress was wonderful....the best part of the experience, but the food was SO disappointing.  I ordered a glass of wine and hub ordered a beer.
Hub wanted to try the pepper rubbed dry chicken, for it is one of their signature dishes and I tried the boiled beef in schezuan sauce...another signature item.
Waitress brought a small spicy cabbage to start that came complimentary....it was the highlight of the whole meal.
Next our entrees came out....huge portions.
Hubby liked his OK, but was not really that impressed.  Mine was horrible.
It was covered in oil....like a ton of it!  I tried to work around the broth/oil to get the pieces of meat and vegetables out of it.  It had a soapy taste to it....very off putting ....not sure if that taste was the goal?  I have never ordered this anywhere else.
I am also concerned I may have consumed about 1000 calories with the oil content alone.....calories I simply cannot afford.   I helped my husband eat some of his chicken.  It was ok....rather spicy which I liked, but this being Las Vegas and moments from Chinatown, going here was a grave mistake.
I will not return.....it was just that bad.   Too bad that the poor staff have to serve this food....they all seemed like they wanted to do great service.
Perhaps I ordered wrong...but signature dish? WOW!",1

 I asked how much 2 separate services would cost me and i was told that they would defiantly work me up an estimate and follow up with me within that day. I wanted a radiator replaced along with a blower motor for my A/C. I was planning on getting ALL my fluids changed as well all spark plugs , spark plug wires radiator hoses steering fluid i was ready to put a bit of $ into my truck since i have no intention of selling it.

ANYHOW after patiently waiting they never followed up , never left a message.

So they didn't screw up on labor but i was pretty excited to see what this place was all about so 1 star for not doing what YOU say your gonna DO.


Update- 

I was a bit harsh with a 1 rating. This company obviously cares about their reputation. They not only rebuttled here on they site they followed up with a phone call quote .

They have a steak and eggs special that runs for $6.99 on Friday and Saturday nights starting at 11 pm.  If you've gone to South Point, you're familiar with their setup.  It's much different here. 

It's not a waiter service restaurant.  You walk up to a register, order your food, then they call you when it's finished.  It comes with the 7 oz steak, two eggs of your choosing, small potato wedges, and two pieces of toast.  The meal itself is amazing.  Like I said, I always come and get it whenever I'm in Vegas.

18423,1,1549929600000,"Review of the AYCE BBQ!  The meat was delicious but the sides and slow service bring the overall rating down.

Party of 9 sitting at 2 tables. 

Side dishes get 3/5: there are fish cakes, cole slow and some other non-memorable sides. They don't have the potatoes or seaweed salad. I would say that Lee's has the most disappointing sides of the other bbq places I've been to around the area. 

Sides: bean soup, steamed egg ... steamed egg is good..pretty much a scrambled egg in a bowl mixed with some salt water

Meat: delicious. Apparently there is a special cut of meat (and expensive cut) that only Lee's has--this is what my krn friend said.  That 'special' meat cut was amazingly delicious and tender. They also have the standard bulgogi, kalbi and the pork bacon strips which I'm not the biggest fan of. 

Service gets 2/5 for being so slow: we had empty plates pile up on separate occasions during our meal; empty meat plates and egg bowls that we were waiting to have cleared. We even had to wait a while for the check to come...you know that while where EVERYONE in your party is waiting for the check. Getting refills for water was also a little annoying.

Coke is ~$2.50 per can

They have nice chopsticks. Light but not thin.  They are easier to grasp than those standard thin krn chopsticks. 

Saw Lee himself eating at the other table. 

Overall, imo, Lee's is not the best korean bbq place in Vegas as others have said. The sides were meh and the service was slow.  Yes, they do have a special cut of meat here but for an overall excellent krn bbq experience, I recommend Honey Pig.",2

18450,2,1550534400000,"I've only ever had fond memories of Wildflower Bakery, so when I ate lunch there the other day with my boyfriend, I'm sad to say it's not the Wildflower I remember. Its been years since I've visited, but my recent experience was less than stellar. 

As we looked over the overhead menu, the cashier waited impatiently, looking around as if she had better things to do. Like lady, I just got here and you have a HUGE menu. You can do whatever you're doing and I'll call you or another employee if I'm ready. Anyway, I rushed my order and didn't request for there to be no arugula, my worst enemy. I then took a seat at one of the few clean booths. We arrived around 1 so lunch rush probably just finished and they had only begun to clean up so it was understandable. The area around the table we chose smelled quite reminiscent of a rest stop bathroom. Other patrons seemed fine but it was definitely noticeable. 

Our food arrived only about 10 minutes later. I'm not a vegetarian but any means, but I do have an unhealthy love for anything with mushrooms so I ordered the Portabello Picnic Sandwhich. I knew there were other vegetables in the sandwich but it was overwhelmingly stuffed with arugula and eggplant. The sand which was still good and edible after I hand picked all the arugula off,  I just wish there was more mushrooms in a sandwhich that advertises mushroom as its star ingredient. My boyfriend got the Reuben which was tasty, but not worth the price tag. I understand there is nothing employees can do about it so there no point throwing a fit. We left full, but not completely satisfied. I wouldn't be opposed to going to this location again, it just wouldn't be my first choice.",2
18457,1,1549152000000,"Not too shabby for PF Chang like cuisine.  However, I am rating this as a Chinese restaurant so please take that into consideration.

a.  Food - The food here is focused on the American palate and taste, so if you like beef broccoli, mongolian beef, cashew chicken, chow mein, wonton soup, pot stickers and fried rice, this is the place for you. However, for authentic Chinese cuisine, this does not compare at all.  In fact, most of the food here on this menu you can find at near 40% lower prices at any other Chinese fast food take out place.  So, if you like the American style food, I give this 4 star, if you like authentic Chinese, I give this 2 star.  

b.  Price - 10-15.00 per plate, I think that this is a bit over priced, and the taste is not so different than the Chinese food they have at the buffet, so I give the price a 2 star. 

c.  Ambiance - Very nice, authentic looking place, they have a very nice room in the back for parties. I think you could fit 30 people onto three tables.  This is very nice.  5 Star!

d.  Service - I was there with a larger party of about 15 people and the servers / wait staff advised us to order two soups per table for the amount we had. That was a HUGE mistake because one soup bowl can probably hold 2-3 quarts of soup and so there was a lot of left over. One bowl would have been  plenty. Also, each dish was a 1.5 size portion, but they advised us on the sizing and it was way too much.  While attentive and nice, the information was poor. I give this a 2 star. 

e.  Location - Well located at the casino, and very convenient to pop in and enjoy if you are at the casino for other reasons. You have to wade through the smoke and stale atmosphere of the casino floor and there is no place to wait or linger if you have kids, since you are in a casino.  So while not unbearable, this is an adult area so do not expect too many accommodations for kids.

I give this a 2 star because for American food, it is decent, however, it is very over priced and a bit uninspired.  The place is basically form over content and fits well with the Casino. It is, like PF Chang and that is the best way to describe it.

GK Says, check it out if you have dinero to burn, and like American style food.",2

18484,3,1550707200000,"I've just recently learned of the fabulousness that is Ike's Love & Sandwiches, and I am a big fan!  

This was my first time at the Mesa location. I ordered the Vegan Pilgrim (vegan turkey, cranberry sauce, Sriracha, vegan dirty sauce + lettuce [I omitted the vegan cheese]) on their french roll/bread. I know, I know. That combination makes no sense, right? Wrong! I've learned to leave my inhibitions down the street and around the corner, and to just trust Ike's on whatever his board says. It. Was. So. Good!  (1/2 of this sandwich never made it out of my parking space!) Cranberry sauce + Sriracha on a ""turkey"" sandwich? Who'd a ""thunk""?!

That's mostly what you'll find here. An amazing concoction of drool & moan-worthy creations (Meg Ryan/Sally, you ain't ready, girl!), surrounded by delicious, homemade bread. Their Dutch Crunch bread is a must try!  They also have a few simple sandwiches, for you retired daredevils. 

Supposedly, there are 100 veggie sandwich options, most of which can be veganized. So for all of my fellow vegans, just be sure to tell them to make it vegan. Here's a vegan breakdown:
They use Daiya for the cheeses, Tofurkey for the vegan turkey, and Gardein for the vegan chicken and meatballs. 
All of their breads are vegan except for the wheat (it's honey wheat). 
The wasabi mayo is automatically vegan, so no need to request a vegan version. 
The ""Air"" fries and tater tots are vegan (and they are baked, not fried).
Their Dirty Sauce is not vegan, but they offer a vegan version (it's delicious!)
Their purple coleslaw is vegan.
There's a vegan french dressing and BBQ sauce.

Not vegan: 
Their pesto, honey mustard sauce, the fried foods, like onion rings & beer battered zucchini (egg based batter), and the obvious (meats and non-vegan cheeses). 
Sun-Devil sauce is NOT vegan & there is no vegan version.

Veggie bacon is vegetarian; not vegan.

They have gluten-free options. 

The girl helping me out was super nice and knowledgeable about their vegan menu. I had a question about the french dressing, and she had a handy-dandy cheat sheet which she used to confirm that it is vegan (or they have a vegan option; I didn't clarify).

Most of the sandwiches are @ $10, but they are big enough to either share or save 1/2 for another day. They offer chips (most of which are vegan too; just avoid the Salt & Vinegar and the BBQ Ranch), bottled and fountain drinks. Nice sized location with plenty of tables and booths inside. There are only a couple of tables outside. It shares a big parking lot with other establishments, so there is plenty of parking.  Located about 3 lights north of US 60, off of the Alma School exit, on the east side of the street (opposite side of the street from the Fiesta Mall).

18504,2,1549065600000,I've been seeing Vanessa for keratin for the past three years and she is by far the most professional and skilled stylist I have ever worked with. I've been doing keratin for years and Vanessa's work is leaps and bounds ahead of the other hair professionals I have worked with in the past. She is incredibly attentive and really works with your personal hair needs. And it lasts - even though I have fairly curly hair naturally I only need to see Vanessa twice a year. If you're looking to get keratin done I highly recommend you see Vanessa.,3

Microwave is broke never worked, balcony screen is broke, bath tub leaks to 1st floor every time I bathe, and maintenance is horrible, the same young guy keeps coming into my place to ""fix things"" but tries to make personal conversation, asking me personal questions. Asked me if I wanted to model for his friends mixtape cover??? WTF??? And the landscape guy pulls over to try and pick me up from the bus stop!!! Seems like these  employee maintenance men want are to score with pretty young tenants rather then to remain professional and do their job which made me very uncomfortable to live in my own home already!! I'm appalled at this situation and already reported one the maintenance men of his inappropriate behavior. Other then that the area is nice and quiet and right in the middle of the art district.

We ordered two soups; the Soon Tofu for spice lovers and a Crunchy Noodle soup for the others. Just wonderful.

-Yellowtail Sashimi- good but not great
-Lobster Bisque- a letdown, very very small portion, not much lobster and really not that great for $19

Steak: 
-30oz Porterhouse: damn fine steak
-American Wagyu Rib Cap: this was very very good.  so tender, very tasty.  

Sides:
-Onion rings: good but not amazing
-mac and cheese: letdown, had high expectations but really not that cheesy, and sorta plain tasting even with the truffle
-Potato puree- meh, wasn't anything special and they all sorta tasted the same even though it was a ""trio""
-brussel sprouts - these were VERY good then again everything with bacon is
-fries- our first order was cold, 2nd order was hot but of course they charged us anyways for the 2nd order

Dessert:
Beignets: the 3 sauces were delish as were the donuts

I guess when it comes down to it - it's vegas and Michael Mina - it's going to be overpriced and somewhat of a let down.

Mild was pretty spicy for me. It's really messy.

Only thing I felt bad about was that there was so much waste - from the plastic bib, gloves, bag of seafood, table ""cloth"" / sheet, napkins and cardboard rim so you don't get burnt from the hot plate.

For some reason, all of my Mandarin speaking girlfriends decide on this place when I ask them where they'd like to eat?  Maybe it's because it's the giant racks of magazines shelved along the entrance which features just about every Asian publisher in existence.  

Wooden tables, wooden chairs, wooden frames for the walls, wooden bubble tea bar.  Oh it's a bubble tea joint, now I know why all of my Mandarin female friends likes this place.  Must be quite lucrative to open a business which all the Chinese girls are genetically pre-dispositioned to throw their money at.  Since when are grottos made of wood?  Also, where is the green?  I don't see anything of that colour?

The food is horrible, not a single item on the menu is fresh.  The chicken wings are packaged grocery frozen wings, this I am certain!  I know that price chopper taste anywhere!  The only thing that they made from scratch is the rice...if you consider cooking rice in a rice cooker making things from scratch.  
The bubble tea, is not so bad.  Good size, but so what?  It's just powdered sugar water.  Should I be impressed by the bartender for diluting the correct concentration of powder to water ratio?  Did he have to go to culinary school for that?
Why are these women not buying snake oil instead?

The mystery of my ethnicity's fascination with this elixir continue to astound me.
There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. 
My pain is constant and sharp, and I do not hope for a better world for anyone.
In fact, I want my pain to be inflicted on others. 
I want no one to escape. But even after admitting this, there is no catharsis; my punishment continues to elude me, and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself. No new knowledge can be extracted from my telling.

18593,1,1549843200000,"This was my first visit to Beckett's Table. Myself and two other friends chose this place to celebrate our birthdays together.  I arrived promptly at 5:00 pm for our 5:00 pm dinner reservations. This is a large restaurant, and there were no other customers there when I walked in.  

There were several staff members seated in the back, having a ""pre-service meeting"".  The hostess would not seat me because this meeting was taking place. So, I stood around up front for about 10 minutes until the meeting broke up.  The hostess never made it clear why I couldn't just make myself comfortable at one of the dozens of other empty tables, that held no staff members, and wait for my friends to arrive.  Not off to a pleasant, nor welcoming, start.

One of my friends arrived and we started out with cocktails.  She ordered a Pimm's cup, which she had never tried before, and really liked it when it arrived.  Our other friend arrived shortly after, and decided to try the Pimm's cup as well.  However, when her drink was delivered, it was much darker than the one that our other friend had received.

Meanwhile, we all ordered dinner from our waiter, Adrian T., and everything was going along just fine.  Our food arrived and we were all enjoying it.  Two of us ordered both the roasted beet & apple dish, as well as the roasted garlic and cauliflower chowder.  Both were fine, although the chowder was overly-garlic'd.  Coming from the school of ""You Can Never Have Too Much Garlic"", I would never have imagined myself thinking that a dish could have too much garlic, but this one did. We didn't mention anything about it to the server, because he did not consider it a huge deal.

About halfway through our meal, my friend that got the first Pimm's cup, and I, ordered a second round of drinks.  Our friend that had the darker Pimm's cocktail, was struggling to get  the drink through the straw.  It apparently was prepared with too large of cucumber chunks that could not get through the straw and, the drink on the whole tasted vastly inferior to, and different from, the first Pimm's, which was delicious. Since the liquid level of the ""bad Pimm's"" was still about a half-inch from the top of the highball glass, we encouraged our friend to send the drink back, as she clearly was not enjoying it and was not going to consume it.

We flagged down Adrian T. and sent the drink back.  Our friend chose to stick with water, rather than order a different cocktail, since we were just about at the end of dinner.  Two of us ordered dessert though.  It was at this point, that there was a very distinct change in Adrian T.'s demeanor.  He basically just stopped with the pleasantries altogether, and was cold and indifferent to us. When it came time for the check, he laid it down and said nothing.  The station he was using to key-in orders was close to our table, so I got up and asked him if he was Ok.  He didn't stop, or look-up, at all and just kept keying in data while he muttered, ""I'm good.""  He dropped back off our receipt and credit cards without a word.  No, ""thank you so much"" or ""I hope to see you again"" or any such feel-goody statement that most professional servers deliver to a table as their parting words. It was all very uncomfortable, awkward and uncalled for. We still have no idea what his problem was. 

I might try this place again someday, as long as they don't seat me in Adrian T.'s section.",2

Last night I had the Chicken and Dumplings and memories were stirred from childhood that I didn't even know were there. A large bowl of hot steamy goodness that filled, not only my hunger, but my very soul. Every bite brought back memories! 

As I watched my family eat shepard's pie and short ribs, that were fork tender on a pile of beautiful mashed potatoes, I wondered if any mother or grandmother could have done it better. Satisfied, we were, to say the least. The three of us shared a piece of chocolate cheesecake. [The chef in our family who makes the most wonderful cheesecakes couldn't have prepared it any better!

18618,3,1550966400000,"Keeping in mind that a trip to Las Vegas leans on plenty of things to get excited about it, it can be quite odd when a single drink happens to crawl up near the top of the list.

The glitz, the glamor, the lights, sounds, people watching, food, shows, etc, etc and I can't wait to get here so I can have a mojito from this place.  Perhaps that is a reflection on me and my vices but I'll own that for this purpose.

This little hut is fantastic.  A nice, short menu with drinks as hand crafted as you can get, right in front of your eyes.  The bartender is enjoyable every time we come and visit her, very personable and obviously puts much pride into her work.  I like the east-coast (I'm gonna guess Boston) accent showing through a bit despite that she said she's been in Vegas 34 years.  The surrounding area is one of the prime spots for people watching on the strip and its also perfect for obtaining a little sun.  

Are they cheap? Nope, but in Vegas what is.  Are they delicious?  Absolutely they are and they will last a lot longer if you just sit down in the sun and relax while you enjoy it and make an event of it because that's what this drink deserves.",2

I highly recommend the, Bicado! - (yep, that's how it's spelled & punctuated on the menu ). They carve their own turkey breasts & make a cold turkey salad with it (similar to cold chicken salad-but better). It was a nice light menu option before going crazy on my ice-cream. We had a shake, sundae & a few banana-splits at the table. All divine!! The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is the wait-service. I felt the wait staff could have been a bit more welcoming & upbeat; especially, for a pricey place to celebrate special occasions.

The eggplant dip was very sweet and different flavor. Since I could not choose between two entrées, the owner was kind enough to split two entrées so I could try both. The grape leaves were very good, no hold up on oils and butter and calories but well worth the splurge including the dessert. Wow, we really ate a lot!  I will undoubtedly return.

I'm a Plus Size bride and I've been wary of going in to try on gowns because I'm a size 18 and that's visibly larger than sample sizes and can be tough on my self esteem. I was a bit nervous when I first met my consultant because she was tiny and petite -- I had no reason to be scared. Morgan made me feel like a queen and she was so knowledgeable about the store's availability. She knew which dresses were or were not in the store and which were available or unavailable in plus size. She showed me so many different silhouettes and proved to me how good I could look in the variety of styles. The fourth dress she pulled was the one. Morgan had the manger come visit and she was so kind and made me feel gorgeous.

I went home after the first appointment feeling like I had found the dress, but I should think about it. Three weeks later, I called again looking for Morgan and last minute came in to see her. I wanted to try a couple new styles that had come in, but she also put me back in the original dress. She picked it out and it's the one!

The pool is a must, we did a Cabana and the drinks and food were spot on, we were enjoying the high life as we got to watch college football games while taking in the sun and fun.  Wait staff was very attentive and helpful with food and drink selections.

Location is great also as you are city central and across from the Aria and Cosmo for the hipsters, but then the hotel is attached to the Planet Hollywood and miracle mile mall for easy access within a short walk.

18677,2,1550707200000,"I felt like I need to provide a current Andrew Blair's review because a lot of these are outdated. Gone are the days of the packed house, dress code and club scene. They've attempted to rebrand with a new countrified logo and feel.  I am personally not a fan of the new AB logo with the wheat behind it but I appreciate their effort to have a more ""comfortable"" neighborhood feel. I saw several people in tshirts, shorts, jeans and sunglasses. Maybe it was the NRA in town but I even spotted some decidedly ""red"" folks.  So maybe it is like a country club, but in Gastonia. :)

Their decor hasn't changed, so it still feels like a nice place, but definitely softer and more comfortable than say a Liberty gastropub. Opt for outdoor seating if the weather cooperates. Even on a hot night the fans keep the air moving and it was nice. They had a sangria special- it tastes fine enough but lacks the fun fruit you can munch on like at Sole, so I'd skip it for their nice wines.

We had the meatloaf with mac and cheese and green beans. I really enjoyed the green beans- they were cooked perfectly and still retained a little snap to them. The meatloaf was also very nice.  We also had the filet mignon.  They had one misfire on temperature, but their make good efforts were overwhelming- best I've seen of any restaurant.  The remake of the steak was cooked perfectly, they replated it with new sides. The manager was very concerned about our happiness and took a lot of time talking with us.  She also invited us to their new brunch on Sundays. They apparently have a creme brulee french toast that looks divine. I wonder if it can compare with 131 Main's granola french toast?  

But I digress. The portions were not large enough for my hungry man so we ordered a side of mushrooms which were nicely seasoned with shallots and scallions. 

We were offered two chocolate bourbon truffles at the end of the night which were lovely- not too sweet, and solid texture. We opted out of dessert (a shock to both of us, I know). 

I would like to go back for their Pinot Thursdays where they do Pinot Noir tastings on the 3rd Thursday of every month. 

Final tip: Citipass coupon book has a buy one get one free. So all in our meal cost $40 including a generous tip. So given that, the value was great.",3

There are three buildings and you have walk around the block to get to all of them.  This may have been my favorite part because the neighborhood (Mexican War streets) is amazing!  The neighborhood is filled with  lots of restored row housing, and small gardens and green spaces.  Some of the houses are painted in really interesting ways.

The one thing that stood out for me was that the staff was very friendly, and they all seemed to love dogs. My husky was showered with love and attention from the staff and customers. The staff always flashed him a genuine smile whenever they would pass our table. It's one thing to allow dogs, but to have employees that seem to genuinely like them is another. I plan on being a regular, and I'm sure I will learn some of their names so I can compliment them properly.",2

It's also smoke-free, a rare find in the neighborhood (though there are smoking areas outside). 

The bar is owned by two brothers, and they've decorated the spot with ""Dukes of Hazzard"" lunchboxes, old records and other memorabilia from their childhood. 

Be sure to catch the owners' honkytonk band, the Loose Lugnuts, which often plays to a rowdy crowd of friends and Plaza Midwood regulars. 

The Beaver has two pool tables, but the back room is much too cramped for any serious playing.

A word of warning: The bartenders don't have much experience making complicated drinks. Stick with beer or basics like rum and coke. 

The parking situation needs some work. The adjacent gravel lot is way too tiny and people end up parking across busy Central Street. So walk or bike there if you can.",1

The bathroom was a little junky and there were some rusted fixturing in the bath tub.  Internet access was not free.  The walls weren't terribly noise-proof.

It was a decent place though.  The hotel is HUGE!  It was like a maze getting to our room---the room was so far from the elevator.

I had to get two root canals done right next to each other, and one was a retreat. Having recently had another root canal at a different Endodontist office, I was honestly dreading how much this was going to hurt. I didn't need to. It was exceptionally quick, recovery time for two teeth was a fraction of what it had been the previous time on just a single tooth, and even though another Endo had suggested I have an additional tooth done, the Dr here preferred I waited to be sure it wasn't a case of referring pain. Dr. Christensen thoroughly tested my teeth, made sure I was comfortable during my visit, explained everything, found the problems that had been an issue, and was professional, patient, and I would gladly return here if or when I may need additional work, even though it is rather far from our home. Worth the drive, excellent care, very pleased.",2

All the previous employees at their old location are now replaced by new ones. So during my most recent visit everyone was literally walking around clueless and handing out orders to the wrong table.

My family and I always expect delicious pho from Golden Turtle but were very disappointed. It took about 20 minutes for our pho orders to come out. When it eventually came to our table all of the noodles were broken. My dad waved over an employee and all he did was awkwardly say that the kitchen staff are new. My dad replied back that this restaurant has been opened for 20+ years so this is not what returning customers expect. The owner then told her employees to send back all of our orders and make new ones. After another 5-10 minute wait we finally had the Golden Turtle pho we were expecting. We were highly unimpressed and definitely will not be visiting anytime soon.

I hope Golden Turtle steps up their game and clean their new location up because it's quite dirty. The windows and floors are not clean. It's as if they ran their old location into the ground before switching to a newer location. Additionally, I really dislike how they have so much MSG in their broths.

So I can't justify spending just over $30 for 2 people to eat the kind of food i can easily make at home if I were in a hurry. Just disappointing.

I've been here about 5 times now, and it's always the same two people I see working it, so I guess they're the owners.  Two main things to get here are the Meat Jun and the Korean Pancake.  They're just to die for!

The Meat Jun is thinly sliced beef covered with egg that was marinated in some sauce that was very flavorful.  I really like it, get it every time.  The other thing is the Korean pancake, which is this thick, savory, egg-like combination of several different kinds of seafood.  It's wonderful, and is definitely good for two people, which is good because it costs $9.95!  

Their banchan is also pretty good, if not amazingly spectacular.  Their kimchee is good, as it should be for a Korean cornerstone, but the spicy tofu is great, and by far the best of the bunch(an) is the fish cakes!  They're thin slices of fried fish cake with sliced peppers and jalapenos.  I never leave without buying a box of them to go.  If they don't give you the fish cakes automatically, just ask, they'll be more than happy to give you a few.

They have sushi here, too, but I can't really say much good about it, except the Korean roll.  The others are basic rolls that you can actually find better elsewhere.

While the bar itself was not busy when we got there, the place did eventually fill up and our large party was able to mingle and move about but still had seating as the night progressed and heals became more uncomfortable.

No soy paper as ordered, missing rolls, forgot to bag my kids meal, and finally didn't place order in the computer and there we were on pick up at closing time with no food. THE OWNERS ARE DISGRACEFUL!! Never did they feel bad for their mistakes or take full ownership. To this day we never got a full refund for any orders that went wrong. It was always ""what's your name next time $10 off"". This last time was the 3rd mistake in a row and when we called asking for a full refund the owner wouldn't and only said ""well seems like we lost you as a customer anyways, I can only refund the amount of food you didn't get"". The customer service is by far the rudest I've ever seen. We enjoyed the food and so we'd order and take it to go so we wouldn't be upset eating in person what with the horrible service.

I went in store for the first time on a Saturday afternoon. The store was busy with a couple rude/demanding groups ahead of us while their children ran around the small store screaming and yelling, the phone was ringing off the hook, and there was only one member on staff. It wasn't until I got home when I opened my to-go box and saw that the staff had messed up my order and gave me the wrong cupcake. The one they gave me was still good but a little disappointing, especially considering I only ordered a total of two cupcakes.

I don't do nightclubs, so I don't know the after-party restaurants, but this one apparently is one of the most popular.

We took a seat, then decided to move to another table.  Some guy grabbed me to compliment on my jewelry.  I got a rice & chicken dish, everyone else got pho.
I saw the same girls at the club whom I refused to dance with, despite them grabbing at me and forcing my arms up and down.  My rule is simple:  No girls at nightclubs.   It's not worth it...

This restaurant became the last straw for me, not because it wasn't good, but because it's not any different from all the other supposed Vietnamese restaurants in the city.  There is no variation between them!
I've been to Vietnam, and there are plenty of restaurants, and almost none of them shared traits.  Vietnamese cuisine is more than a bowl of noodle soup, or fried chicken cutlets.  How have they gotten away with this??

Came here for summerlicious for lunch with a group. Server was very friendly and attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. And I love the vibe of the restaurant - spacious and rustic feeling and clean. However, the food itself is a bit mediocore. The waitress said the meatballs were home-made so I ordered that (outside of the summerlicious menu). I was expected a bunch of meatballs but instead it was just one large one. Looked more like an appetizer and not a main. It tasted okay but definitely overly garlicky. The mains for the summerlicious menu were okay - no one at my table was too overly impressed with them. I did enjoy the desserts however (tiramisu and chocolate jar cake). 

Overall, I'd say this is a great environment for a date night but don't expect mind blowing food. The summerlicious menu for lunch is $18 so it is one of the cheaper summerlicious restaurants.",3

Our appetizer came out pretty quickly.  After looking around at the tables near us I noticed no one had any entrees, and shortly after realizing this another waiter came to tell his table that the kitchen was very backed up. Not a big deal but definitely raised a flag. We waited about 15-20 minutes for food, which wasn't even that bad, but the manager was making rounds apologizing to everyone saying that it usually isn't this long of a wait.  

After receiving our food we had multiple problems. Both entrees came out incomplete. We ordered a salmon baja bowl and a chicken and shrimp burrito. The salmon bowl came out with no salmon (go figure) and the burrito came with only chicken and was missing shrimp. To compensate for these mistakes we were given the burrito at half price ($5.75 off) and received the shrimp in a to-go box.  

I must say this was a majorly disappointing experience. I've heard great things about this place, and the food was delicious even though it was all wrong.

Typically waiters drop off the food then come by a minute or two later to ensure everything is cooked properly.

Entering the park you pay $7 a car and can park up at the Conservation Center that allows one to peek into the life of the Red Rock inhabitants. Hawks, desert iguanas, rattlesnakes, scorpions, desert tortoises are on display along with desert landscape and environmental facts. They have a nice gift shop should you want purchase a Red Rock hat or shirt, a cactus plant or a Native American replica. 
Now, it gets really good once you begin one of the many hikes. From easy to advanced, 2-3.5 hour hikes are there for your adventure. 
Drive up through the scenic route, which is 13 miles, you have the opportunity to stop a few times to get out and explore or take pictures. 
The landscape along that 13 mile road changes also, from jutting, striated cliffs and enormous boulders resting precariously upon another, inviting you to come take a look around, loads of crevasses and small caves lay awaiting to be explored.  Then driving just a few miles on the winding road, it turns to bumpy,scabrous, craggy mountains dabbled with green bushes tucked within its regresses. On further still, amazing tall evergreens and lusher foliage in deep ravines and ditches look completely different than the miles before. 
I can imagine a lot of time could be spent exploring the different areas of Red Rock Canyon Conservation Area, many photo ops and opportunities to discover what this southern Nevada desert has hidden away.",1

18900,3,1550188800000,"Made dinner reservations for a Saturday evening. Arrived and was informed that we had a table in a ""semi-private room"" which was a bit further than the main restaurant location and also had no restroom, so if you wanted to use the restroom, you would have to either walk through the main gallagher's enterance to take a shortcut or walk around to get it. The room we were in was very dimly lit (not sure if they were going for that intimate feel or just wanted to make you feel extremely tired) and already had a party of 20-30 people who were loudly talking to one another across the table. We tried to ignore it at first and thought maybe our server would let them know to keep their voices down, but nope. Anyways, we ordered our food and since I've never tried a dry-aged steak before, I decided to go with that (medium rare) and a baked potato. When my meal came, at first glance it looked like my steak was very burnt at the top, however, the baked potato was very huge. The first cut into the steak was very difficult, then as I looked at my piece of steak, it was cooked rare (I assume the waitress wrote rare on the order because she couldn't hear us say ""medium-rare"" because of how loud the room was). Such a huge disappointment, for a $50+ steak, go spend your money somewhere else in Las Vegas because they obviously did not care about us. I'm not one to complain about many things, but this was possibly the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my entire life. Would I give this place another shot? Possibly. Note to future diners, if you have a large party, DON'T LET THEM PUT YOU IN THEIR ""SEMI-PRIVATE ROOM"".",3

The only thing that was a bummer was they didn't have a cup of soup option only a bowl and it was way too much as a started so we wasted a lot. She had the scallops which were perfectly cooked and I couldn't decide so I went with recommendation of waiter and had the shrimp and grits which did not disappoint. Very cozy and warm atmosphere.

18924,3,1550620800000,Professional and good customer service!!!This company was referred to me by the restoration company that was initially called by my plumber due to presence of mold in my ceiling. I was worried of what the initial company told me about my home insurance not covering my claim if there is already mold but when Javier came in he immediately explained what was covered and spoke to my insurance adjuster. He sent the mold remediation team led by Christian who explained the whole process and when everything was done they sent their repair team led by Manny the field supervisor and his crew. Cesar the dry wall guy explained everything to me and went above and beyond and repaired a part of the wall not included in the repair as he said he will just throw away the plaster anyways. The toilet was then repaired and now appears better that it was. The support team in their office kept me updated and was always readily available and calls back with answers to my concerns. I would definitely call them back if I need any upgrades in the house.,2

Get a margarita. they make one out of Cactus flower or pear or something. 
Insanely good if your a tequila / margarita fan. Doesn't come in some stupid giant neon green glass or anything so cheesy. Just nice and tasty and a small sophisticated glass. 

I can't even remember what we ordered. My wife and I tried something new each time we went and were always sad to leave. staff was great. food was great. 

Every trip into the city we would make our way over to eat the food. unfortunately they shut down the NY one and the Las Vegas one is a bit to far to drive as you can image.

The ambiance is great with plenty of seating arrangements, dance floor to the back and open concept bar that wraps around the whole bar.
As for service, it was impeccable and attentive.  
As for food we had their: 
**Saganaki (Greek cheese) served with bread. 
**Funghi Flatbread with mushrooms, gouda, carmelized onions sprinkled arugula, this was a great dish to pair any drink.
**Smoked chicken Lollipop   
**Chili cheese Tater tots.  All of which were great dishes. 
As for mains I decided to give their 1/2 fried chicken served with biscuits and gravy- gigantic pieces of fried chicken indeed a meal that's easily shareable.

We wanted to see what had been done to the old Higbees. Maybe try some slots which we did.
I felt sorry for the lady taking the parking money because she must hear some crap because of this ridiculous policy.

The review gets 2 stars for the waitress, who was awesome, that is the only good thing this place has going for it!! 1.) The escargot came out almost cold, everyone knows that escargot is to be served hot. 2.) It took forever to get the bread, which should have been automatic, the service overall was very slow. 3.) The music was a bit loud, but it was ok, tolerable, we could still hear each other, and then the ""MOD"", aka ""the owner's daughter"" came in, apparently heard her jam by Britney Spears and decided to crank it up. We decided that it's better to freeze outside, than go deaf listening to Britney inside. We already ordered out food, so we felt bad leaving right then, and decided to stay. 4.) After waiting about an hour (no exaggeration) for our food, we ""dared"" ask the manager if they were understaffed that night, since we saw our waitress running around and apparently prepairing some food in the kitchen as well (she was warming up our bread earlier), and overheard the hostess saying so to another table, and got a response,""Noooo!"" Packaged up with an eye roll and some attitude on the side. Are you kidding me?!!!! Is this the kind of service a restaurant provides? Is this how customers get treated?!! Nobody talks to me like that, especially in a place where I am a paying customer! Shocked and appalled we were! Shocked and appalled, I tell you!!! Thankfully our waitress knew how to calm us down, and get the situation under control, b/c I was about to slap the bitch! To cut the story short, when the food arrived it was gross, I hated mine, and my companion got sick from his. I couldn't resist but tell the waitress that she is too good for this place, and that she should leave.

Anyway, all I can say is that this place is GREAT.  Now, we like a good straightforward cheese pizza, not all the bells and whistles, and theirs was honestly the best pizza either of us have had pretty much anywhere.  No lie.  This comes mostly from the crust which, on our pizza, was perfect.  Crisp on the bottom, yet still chewy, plenty of those great dough bubbles (you know what I'm talking about!), and really flavorful.  The sauce was delicious, not too spicy, not too sweet.  And the cheese was also perfectly flavorful, not super stringy like you get on a gimmicky cheap pizza, and not totally greasy like...well, like on Secret Pizza, a total grease bomb if you ask me.

We had salads, too, and my beet salad was great.  Something special, if you want to splurge (which we did).  

The atmosphere was pleasant, no blasting music like you get in some Vegas restaurants now, and there were games going over the bar so it felt comfortable and casual.  The service, in our case, was prompt and pleasant.

We went on a Sunday and the line was out the door.However,it moves quickly and your order comes out quick too.Due to their being a crowd,seating was not the best despite outdoor seating.I'm not sure if it was because this place is new or if it was a prime time,but just a heads up!",2

The ingredients are as fresh as can be, no preservatives, and every type of pizza is simple in terms of the ingredients but complex in terms of the taste.  So good!

Unfortunately, I can't say I absolutely loved the pizza. But WAIT! It's not necessarily their fault! I decided to give free range to my dining companions to choose toppings. We ended up with entirely too many for this thin crust pizza to handle (counting them now, I can recall at least 8). I'd like to go back and give it another try with 2-4 toppings and see how I feel about it. We also tried the jalapeño poppers - I do not recommend them. Too much breading and bland (tasted like they came frozen from a bag).

DeLuca's walls are covered in Pittsburgh history, making wait for your breakfast not so bad! The diner is also a lot bigger than expected, it goes back pretty far.

My boyfriend and I love this place and have been here so many times, but my parents have never been until I brought them here last month! They were SO impressed by the huge portions they received and loved everything. My dad had the Steel City Breakfast Of Champs, which consisted of a Short stack of pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 pcs of bacon, sausage, homefries & toast (mancini's toast to be exact). He loved everything and was really impressed with the pancakes! They were perfectly fluffy and just delicious. I had the hotcake special and loved every minute of it.

Literally, the day before closing, our loan lady at the bank, who was not very good, had made some mistakes in the loan and it was delayed.  Frustrated, as you could imagine, we checked into the Rio Hotel and had to start all over again with financing because quite honestly, our faith in the bank was no longer there.  Lauren found us a local mortgage guy who closed the loan in 2 weeks.  Unheard of, I know!  She saved us from living in a hotel for 30-60 days.  I can't sing her praises enough.  Love you Lauren!",1

When ordering Beef tataki, order 2, 5 or 10, we kept getting an order of 5. We got some orders we didn't even order but we were hungry so ate it anyway.

Service was great. Since it was a Monday, it wasn't busy, so that was as nice bonus. The Rock Lobster Caesar is great ! comes garnished with a lobster tail and rimmed with steak spice. We got the three cheese lobster dip, which was super duper cheesy and delicious! The chips that come with it are amazing. We also got lobster mac n cheese, which was good, but nothing to boost about - could've used more flavour. We also had fresh oysters which were REALLY fresh and also broiled crab. This place falls under the seafood category, so prices match that of other seafood establishments. Great place for lobster dishes.",2

The customer service at the registration desk is horrible and the policy to give rooms to the first knew who arrive even if they didn't reserve the room in advance is ridiculous.

I've had wagyu multiple times before and I'm still trying to figure out how they won best steak in Esquire.  It was over seasoned and chewy - someone else had the Kansas steak and that was executed much better.

The duck fat french fries were divine, as was the mac and cheese with truffle.  However, it does get overwhelming.  I LOVE truffles, but even I had to call it quits at this restaurant.

The noise level is extremely high, I am sure it is just the way Mandalay Bay is constructed.  Not a place for an intimate dinner.

However, let me wax lyric about the service.  Seamless, attentive and understated.  All the wait staff helped each other and my water glass was never once less than 1/2 full.  You do not notice the wait staff.  They are there immediately when you need something but totally unobtrusive.  Excellent!",2

seating was my least favorite part.  the big table in the center had 2 couples, each seated one seat in, which wasted a good 4-6 seats being that we had a party of 4.

If I could give it more then 5 stars I would.  The one attribute that stands out is honesty.  Dr. Rob runs an honest practice.  His true desire is to help patients at an affordable price.  
I agreed to pay in advance  (very affordable I might add), for treatment doctor Rob felt would help my pinched nerve.  I told him I would likely be moving and I wouldn't be able to finish treatment.  He assured me that getting the unused appointments refunded would be no problem at all.  Today is my last day of regular treatment...and I was fully refunded for all unused appointments no questions asked.  We are moving and can't commute for further treatment but I will say, if there ever is an issue with my neck or shoulder I will drive back.  These doctors are worth the commute for excellent care. 

Alley gives them 5 stars as well.  She liked their quick appointment times that didn't interfere with her walks and their flexibility that allowed her to go to California twice during the course of treatment. She felt the play area had lots of options, toys, books and art so the wait for any child would seem quick as parents underwent treatment.  She is very happy to get a refund so she can stop by the store for bbq fixings.

I'll put you in palms place studio suite complimentary !"" we were soooo excited ! The only problem was we got a little lost at all the different elevators to get to our room on the 26th floor!  The elevators that say L56 are the ones that go to all levels . The rooms are beautiful clean , kitchenette is very handy ! Double shower head and jacuzzi tub to die  for !

Mona. Mona Mona Mona. How I loathe thee. 
From September to January you screwed up my prescriptions AND screwed with my insurance by NOT paying attention to written prescriptions I gave to you. Personally. My schedule 3s....you IGNORED & didn't fill leaving yourself to scramble on a Saturday to fill them when you had a week to verify it. During that week you ignored my script, my health plan reset meaning instead of paying $00 for my scripts I had to pay full price bc my deductible hadn't been met. All you said was ""Sorry.""

I had foot surgery in September. I stood at the window with my foot in a boot & crutches and you had the nerve to ask my doctor why she wrote me for 2 schedule 3s and then asked which foot did I have surgery on. Not only are you a blind idiot....you're stupid, thinking YOU can violate HIPAA & then get bitchy with my doc when they refuse to violate HIPAA. You're a pharmacist, not my doctor.

First visit:
Booked an appointment based on the recommendation of a friend that had just tried Mint the week before. The first thing I noticed is that I was able to book my appointment online. Being that the idea struck me at 1130pm, it was really easy and convenient to be able to make an appointment for the next day. I received an instant confirmation email which was a nice touch. The studio was cute and the polish selection was very impressive. I also appreciated that the polish was not old and I didn't need 10 layers to make it look normal. I've had the experience with walk-in salons where the polish has been old and gone on streaky. The owner greeted us immediately and the entire experience was really pleasant.

Like many cafes in Toronto, it's pretty pricey. The desserts are also alright, but once again, pricey. Unlike many of Toronto's cafes, the service is very friendly and the drinks are well made.You would think that this place would be snobby, but my experiences have always been good.

The interior is sparse and lackluster, sort of a banquet hall feel for some reason. It was clean but missed the charm some how. 

The staff was very nice and helpful, they appeared to be short a person or not prepared for the large crowd. 

I scanned every ones plates while walking to the bar and saw a nice mix match of entrees. Pizza, pasta, salads, hoagies etc. It all looked good. 

I choose the 7 inch Margherita and a salad with blue cheese. The pizza is a wood fires thin crust cooked to perfection. Topped with mozz and basil. The sauce was a tomato based but has decent flavor. It was a little salty but I liked it. The cheese was a little thin in places but it worked, the basil was haphazardly tossed to one slice of the 7 inch pizza but meh it is only basil. The pizza was good but not as good as Pizza A Metros. I hated to compare but I did. 

The salad was large for a side, with romaine, mushrooms, red pepper and tomato's The dressing was blue cheese but not a thick type it was a thin coating of a nice flavored dressing. 

The bottles sprite I had was flat, odd but still was OK.

19227,2,1549670400000,"Arboretum ooh Arboretum 
My family and I frequent the Arboretum for shopping at places like Bed Bath & Beyond as well as Walmart and Michaels. We decided to slow drive through the entire lot on both sides to see what else was offered and ran across a couple restaurants.
I immediately took to YELP to see some pics and read some review highlights to determine if we were going to try out any of the restaurants. After looking this place up I saw so many ups and downs in opinions and decided that we needed to down our own opinion and give this place a try and what better time to do so than Queens Fest Week as I've read how pricy this place can be.

The food was decent and edible, the service sucked as the server was very distant and unattentative. We had to nearly stand up to get his attention and get him to come over to refill water or to pick up finished dishes.
The add on cost were ridiculous during Queens Fest. It caused the 3course meal to only be about $4 less than ordering from the regular menu which isn't really a deal in my opinion as a restaurant enthusiast who knows a deal when I see one or am experiencing one. 

I honestly enjoyed my dish which was the crab cakes and having lived in MD for 2 years I know a GENUINE crab cake when I see and taste one. The string beans were also extremely tasty and you get a LOT. My husband had the filet scampi which was a filet mignon topped with shrimp scampi and he didn't leave any behind LoL. My daughter had lobster tails which was one of the upgrade cost and she wasn't full from it as she LOVES food and thought she was on a cruise at the Captain cocktail party where you get unlimited lobster tails LoL. For dessert my daughter again upgraded cost to get the chocolate cake which she is still raving about. I had carrot cake and my husband had the cheesecake. We all had dessert as leftovers and also the string beans as they give you a LOT on the side. My daughter had grits left over as well as that was the side she had with her lobster tails. 

The amount of sides offered and the type of sides offered is pretty slim which is another caveat in conjunction with the overpricing.

Overall, if the service didn't SUCK I wouldn't mind spending the extra money to have dinner here once in a while. The hubby thinks we should try again in the future and hope for the best. If anything changes I'll be sure to update my review",2

They were happy to communicate via email, text and phone call at our convenience - they were always prompt to reply. The showroom has great hours and a relaxed atmosphere - we never felt pressured to buy anything and they didn't try to up-sell us to make more $. They suggested the more economic high quality fixtures and materials and kept us under budget.

The food was good. Some appetizer munchies like calamari that was done right, a crab stuffed thingy which was really good, and an icebery wedge with delicious bacon bits and bleu cheese crumbles. I had a steak for an entree. It was perfectly cooked and had very good flavor. My bernaise sauce on the side was also very good. 
Why not 5 stars? The price. Much like Ocean Club and Mastros, this place charges huge prices for what you get. I have no problem plunking down $100/person (not including wine) if I feel that I am getting something truly memorable. (see my review of Posh). 
But the $20/per person premium over what I pay at Eddie V's for the exact same quality food isn't justified. 
Ocean Prime's food and ambiance are superb. So are many other places in this economy competing for my dollars and they cost less. Sorry, but I will stick with Eddie V's, Flemings, Roy's, etc.",2

The food was good, not out of this world amazing, but we enjoyed it. Daughter has the mouse pancake, which they made into a Minnie Mouse, complete with a bacon ""smile"", blueberry ""eyes and nose"" and orange slice ""eye lashes"". She loves pancakes and Minnie Mouse, so she definitely loved it. 

Husband had the biscuits and gravy meal. He said the biscuits could have used a little more gravy, and the gravy needed a little more sausage, but otherwise really great meal. The potatoes are amazing, and don't have all that ""crap"" other places put in them (onions, peppers, etc). 

I ordered the mushroom omelet, and a side of biscuits and gravy. The mushroom omelet was too much for me, so my husband ate that too. He said it was ""ok"", had to add hot sauce to it, but he ate the whole thing. I filled up totally on the small side of biscuits and gravy, and I thought it was delicious!

I met a friend at Perk for a weekday lunch last Wednesday.  I'd been wanting to try it for awhile and wasn't surprised to find it hiding in a strip mall (like so many little gems here in AZ).

The service was not attentive despite the fact that there were few patrons while we were there.  (I have a feeling they get slammed for weekend brunches though).

One more perk is that I believe they have free wi-fi (but I cannot attest to using it).

Would I return? Sure.  
Am I rushing back? No, but I don't want to deter you from checking it out.  And please let me know if you are more ""perked up"" after dining at Perk than I am!",1

The store is very clean- everything is easy to find, and the service is friendly and charming. 

Don't stress out if your Spanish is limited or non-existent. Go in, be friendly and you will be treated warmly and have no problems. 

I highly recommend grabbing some of this tasty steak & chicken and having friends over. It's super easy to grill and the taste is exceptional.

After almost an hour of waiting a Manager came up to tell us how ""transparent"" he would be and that we could expect a table around 11:00 PM. The entire patio was open except for one table. We were told that due to fire code we could not pull tables together. Then a table opened up inside that we were told we could sit at got bumped for a reservation. Finally after an 1:15 minutes we were sat outside. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and took good care of us. Unfortunately the same Manager that told us we could get a table at 11:00 PM came out to chat. I asked if he could do anything to help rectify the situation. He told me he would send his GM out. She came out and this is where the night went really south. I have never come across a more condescending, rude employee in my life. She had zero compassion and talked down to us the entire time. We expressed that we would not be back due to our experience and she did not care. Due to her lack of compassion and condescending tone we will never be back again and I would recommend you do the same.",2

Food is good, not especially awesome, but the service makes up for it. They give you a two broths to start with, a spicy broth and a plain one. The meat selection is limited, but still good.

The staff is friendly and reasonably attentive, most of whom speak Mandarin. My drink never failed to be empty for more than a minute. They were also very good about refilling the broth. We had a group of 30 or so there and the staff managed to accommodate with any major disruption in their service.",2
19325,3,1550016000000,"One of the worst food dining experiences I've ever had. The waitress seemed to be somewhat clueless and could not even give any recommendations without reading the menu. Lemonade is one of the cheapest things to make and it is 3.50 a glass and tastes what I would assume drain cleaner to taste like. I ordered chicken tinga and crispy fish tacos, both items left a lot to be desired. The chicken tinga was incredibly spicy and I could taste nothing else. The crispy fish had no taste whatsoever, overly deep fried. I also ordered the adobo fries which had no flavor what so ever but did have a hefty dusting of some granulated spice. 

I would strongly suggest saving yourself the inconvenience of getting dressed and hitting up Taco Bell all while saving yourself some money.  No wonder that Rum is heavily encouraged on the menu as you would have to be drunk in order to eat at this establishment. 

I would give no stars if at all possibly but Yelp requires at least one for a listing.",2

We got two, one cinnamon swirl and one pecan praline. I was able to taste a sample of the praline pecan before I bought it. Delicious! The frosting is so good.

The food was decent. I think the best part of the experience was the teppanyaki-style stations at the center. They perfectly cooked salmon fillets. We also tried the shrimp, but found it a little too difficult to peel off the shell. We also enjoyed the sushi. Kudos to Wok of Fame for storing bottles of low-sodium soy sauce at the table.

We also enjoyed the plethora of dessert choices. I tried a number of the dessert selections, including the red bean ice cream and the apple pie. I wanted to try the soft-serve ice cream but was too stuffed at the end of dinner.

All in all, a decent restaurant. Though I think the AYCE options in the Markham/Richmond Hill area have better selection for the price. I wouldn't mind coming to Wok of Fame for the birthday deal, but would think twice about coming here at full price.",3

I usually order the yellow curry with chicken(spicy 8/10) or the drunken noodle(spicy 8/10). If you like spicy they definitely come full force. Usually when I go to other Thai restaurants I have to ask for the highest rating of spice because apparently they don't understand my love for spicy food but here it is the perfect amount of heat that is not unbearable. And they are very good on filling up my glass of water which is something I appreciate. And they constantly check up on me to make sure everything is okay even on a busy night.

I didn't know much about their beer before arriving, but was delighted to discover that they do a great balanced Belgian. Louisa, my awesome bartender was happy to let me try a few things, recommend new options based on my preferences and even told me I made the perfect choice for lunch in going with the mac and cheese flatbread (carbs on carbs, you guys!). I tried most of what they had on tap and selected three different pints, my fave being the Out to Pasture. Nothing was two sweet and they did have an american style IPA on tap for those of you that prefer a hoppier beer.

19399,1,1551312000000,"What a mixed bag.

The place is clean and pretty, very pleasantly located downtown with several dining venues around.  The bar is reasonably priced for downtown, although they supply a limited offering.  Bartenders were patient and professional.  The chairs, however, are uncomfortably small.

There is an overpriced boutique, where you can spend $90 on a 9"" bust of Beethoven, or $10 on a music box's innards probably mass produced by the sweat of children in China listening to Beethoven while they work.  Hey, it's your money, do what you want.

We were there for opening weekend to hear Beethoven's 5th.  Let me say that technically speaking, the musicians and conductor were simply fantastic and flawless.  I have perfect pitch and I didn't flinch once.

I did not like that we were subjected to an opening piece of modern noise that has no other legitimate category than 'music' that was composed by the conductor's long time friend since they were kids.  It was called ""Remnants"" I believe, and it was supposed to be the dialogue of 2 gongs.  What it reminded me of was this time my kids ran through a kitsch store and crashed liberally into some wind chimes.  It was dreadful that somebody performed this with an orchestra purposefully, and I took the time to reflect on my past sins and how I might atone for them to avoid further karmic punishment.

I learned quickly that, while I am a patient person who loves classical music, the symphony is not for me.  Several times I dozed off when the more melodic pieces began.  Then I found myself giggling uncontrollably at the woman sitting in front of me.  She appeared as a cross between a frustrated librarian and a cockatiel; she furiously snapped her head and beamed a death glare at people who cleared their throat, or dropped coins on the floor, or silently used their cell phones...I did not commit any of these atrocities, but I did sing part of the National Anthem which she killed me quickly with her gaze for doing.

19424,1,1550966400000,"I like to start by saying that in no way this negative review should reflect sale advisor Andrew because he did his job very well and professional.
My problem was in the finance dept, I didn't have my debit card with me, so I had return on Monday with the rest of my down payment because the bank already had closed for the weekend.
We had agreed on the term of sale, the finance person had printed two sale contracts, the 1st was without the $1,500 down payment and the 2nd with $1,500 down payment that I would bring on Monday.
My payments were supposed to be $429. Monthly for 60 months after applying the $1,500 down payment, rebate and dropping the price to the advertised price of $22, 655 + 499.00 + 30.00 + plus taxes.
That was what agree to on the day of the sale but on Monday when I returned to the dealer to drop off the $1,500 and get the actual sale contract that the finance guy had put inside the folder that was preprinted on the of sale.
Since I had purchased a vehicle in the past from the same finance guy I was very relaxed but this was my 1st mistake, second mistake was to trust the finance guy and signed the contract without taken a second look and that was my biggest mistake.
Well 3 weeks later to my big surprise when I pulled my sale contract at DMV to show it to the clerk, I was shocked by the numbers.
Somehow the finance dept had switched the sale contract and the number had switched from $429 x 60 months to $429 x 75 months.
Again, I should have had never trusted anyone at this dealer, they put their mask to take advantage of any mistake you do and they got me.
Survey time, I was my time to let them know how unhappy I was with their dishonesty but they were not happy about and course I get a call from the finance manager asking as if they're know why I was so unhappy.
I was told, that he was going to fallow up and look into the dishonest deal, you know I was not going to hold my breath because until this day as you may had guessed I didn't get a phone call.
My biggest mistake was to let my guard down, they took advantage and showed me that they belong in the page with all dishonest dealers in town.
My messages to you guys even when they make you feel comfortable don't let you guard down, they're looking for that slip off, they founded when they learned that my wife had died few weeks before, they played cards right with the sympathy mask. Just remember they're not your friends, they want to believe that they're.
So, even when they're telling you the numbers you want hear, still go line by line on your sale contract because this is the time when you will see numbers that you didn't agree.
Again, I was the jerk for trusting the finance department, past experiences the finance dept will be the one to screw you up but there are trained to make you see it the other way around, if you don't believe me, when you get home go over the paper work.
Multiply your monthly payments by the amount due monthly and then add your down payment plus rebates and that's your truth cost.
And don't be surprises if after they screw you up, the words thank would come out of your mouth.
While seating at one the tables waiting for my car I overhear a female in hers 30's tells her mom that her payment was going to be $354 monthly for 75 months, right away that didn't make senses to me so I asked her are you sure that doesn't make senses, she showed me her phone where the vehicle was listed and she also told the finance guy told her that her credit score of 688 was too low to get lower finance.
This were the number for her vehicle, listed $18,040, dealer discount $1,750, Factory Rebate $2,500 = Net Price $13,790 Plus Tax and Fees $1,711 = Total $15,501 - $4,000 her down payment = Net to Finance $11,501.
So, $354 x 75 payments = $26,550 Plus Down, rebate, dealer discount ($8,250) = Total Cost $35,810 For a Basic 2018 Elantra but she was happy, because she was driving away with a new car.
This blow up my mind how people get taken for a ride and after you try to help them they don't see because they just got blinded by the finance dept. I still have bad dreams about that poor lady.
But they always will tell you, they not making any money on the vehicles.

19448,1,1550448000000,Typical bar atmosphere.  Good service. The wings are some of THE BEST I've ever had . Tried 5 different sauces and they were all good. You can get them smoked and that just adds to the flavor. The wings themselves are huge and cooked perfectly. Crispy outside and tender inside. I would go back next time I want wings,2
19449,1,1550707200000,"First Dinner in Vegas!

My lovely boyfriend reserved a dinner for two at bouchon, since he's a huge thomas keller fan. The resturaunt is located inside the emaculate venetian hotel. The resturaunt was beautiful with a romantic ambiance, dim lighting, with a high class feel. We were seated outside by a beautiful fountain and view of the pool. 

The service was amazing, our waitress was a sweet lady and got our orders in quickly. We were given a complementary baguette formed beautifully resembeling leaves or a vine with butter and a small bowl of pistachios while we waited for our meal.  For appetizer we ordered the Terrine de foie Gras de canard which came with toasted baguettes $25. We also had Foie Gras Saute', a pan seared dish $24.75. This was my first experience with duck/goose liver, and I must say it is now one of my favorite things to eat. The conard was more so a liver spread, served cold to top the toasted bread, which was tasty. I prefered the seared version, i felt that prepared this way the flavors were much more elevated.  The textures like butter when seared and the flavors amazing. Not a trace of the irony liver taste you'd expect.

For my meal I opted for the Croque Madame $18.95.
A unique play on the rather simple ham and cheese, my boyfriend tells me it's normal for the french. It came on brioche bread, with a fried egg, smothered in their mornay sauce (white gravy) with a side of delicious french fries. It was delicious, comprised of the best ingredients, definitley filling.  But sad to say I'm just not a fan of soggy bread.
  
We finished the night with a dessert to share. A simple chocolate mousse. This was good. But lacked the oohh!ahhh! factor I was hoping to reach. This trip was one directed towards food and we've been cruising around to try things on a long list of amazing places; needless to say, we were happy and stuffed.

Thomas you make amazing simple french food, and you execute them effortlessly. I give you 4 stars, and wait cant wait for round two with different selections. But I must say your foie gras rocks!",2
19457,2,1550102400000,"Read the reviews and with friends in town, decided to make a visit (first time).  Ordered a veggie poutine and a pulled pork poutine.

The Good: Customer friendliess, fries freIymade fresh, 

The Bad: Not enough poutine on the pulled pork poutine and cheese curds on both.

Doubt I'll visit again.  They need to learn from Smoke's.",2
19469,1,1548979200000,The food was delicious and service was excellent! Definitely highly recommend and will be returning again soon.,2
19471,2,1550188800000,"The service was the worst and the food was horrible. The hot dog appeared as if it was cooked in the microwave.
Hard texture. The burger that my daughter ordered was super dry. Not to mention when the server brought spoons for the shakes she placed them on the table that had yet to be cleaned. When strawberry shake arrived it was ill prepared. The cup had chocolate on it and shake was dripping all over the place. I didn't even finish what I ordered because I was so disgusted with the quality, presentation and service. Take a little pride in food prep.",3
19474,2,1549497600000,"Did not disappoint. I've been to several other Ruth's Chris locations and this was on par if not better with the others. I had the cowboy ribeye cooked Pittsburgh rare, my wife and a friend had the surf and turf and his wife had the filet. All were cooked perfectly and were absolutely delicious. We also enjoyed the onion ring appetizer (totally recommend) as well as the potatoes au gratin and broccoli for sides. The potatoes were excellent however the broccoli could've stood some more seasoning as it was a little bland. 

The wait staff was friendly, prompt, and efficient, I don't believe anyone saw the bottom of their glass without being asked for a refill. 

All in all if you're looking for a meal worthy of the price, look no further, Ruth's Chris has you covered.",2
19475,2,1549843200000,"This is by far my favorite buffet in Las Vegas. Every time I go to Vegas, I make sure I eat here. The food is EXCELLENT! I love the made to order pasta. It is just absolutely amazing, you can pick your sauce(red, white, pesto), the type of pasta, and if you want shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, etc... The sushi is great, not the best, but its ok. They have made to order salads, and made to order soups. The salads are fully customizable, but the soups are more set and just picked, but it is made fresh, in front of you. The service is pretty good, but it really depends on who you get as your server. Now, for the best part, the dessert, just absolutely AMAZING. The eclairs are to die for. They have cottan candy, cookies, gelato, fresh fruit pastries, and other cakes. EVERYTHING is made in house. Not like those buffets where you can tell the dessert was bought and stuffed on a tray. Once again, I love the eclairs, and the coffee gelato. You will not regret coming here, I guarantee it. It is just amazing, one of the best buffets in Las Vegas. And the price is not even expensive, I think it's like 18 for lunch and 30 for dinner.",2
19484,2,1549065600000,I'll never go here again. They screwed up my order the first time and then proceeded to charge my bankncatf ecgta money for a tip when I gave them a great tip even though they screwed up. I never agreed to an extra card charge and they charged anyways.  It's not worth a damn bit of your money and make sure you dont use your bank card cause they will charge without your agreement.,2
19484,3,1549497600000,"Hands down the best General Tso's chicken I have ever eaten.  The honey lemon chicken is also incredible.  I've been here many times but never have I had the willpower to venture beyond those two powerhouse dishes.  I've had tastes of other people's platters, though, and they were also delicious.

Another plus: this is a really nice restaurant.  Not one of those this-chair-is-kinda-wobbly-and-this-silverware-looks-kinda-dirty Chinese places.  It's also reasonably priced and the portions are large.

One caveat: the amount of rice you get with your meal seems to be somewhat random but depends in part on how many people are at your table.  The more people you have, the less rice you tend to get per person.  Once we asked for a second serving of rice and got charged a ridiculous amount of money for it.  I don't remember how much it was, but I remember that it was enough that we asked the waiter about it when we got our check.",2
19488,2,1550361600000,"We came here for lunch today specifically around a promotional dessert item they have been advertising.  The service was fairly good, a little slow at times but very nice.  We started with the Bread and Butter board, it sounded great with some of the reviewers talking about pretzel bread and jalapeno cheese bread, we had what appeared to be 3 types of bread but as far as taste went only one of them had a hint of sweetness over the other two maybe a raisin bread?  Not sure but they were a bit dry and although they tasted home made it did not taste like they were home made today, and there was no variety or distinctness to any of them.
For entrees we had the Hamburger and the Cuban sandwich.  My mom didn't say anything about the Hamburger so not really sure what her thoughts were.  The Cuban is what added the third star, otherwise I would have went with 2.  Although I would classify it more as a BBQ Pork Sandwich than a Cuban.  The pork was very tender and tasty and the sauce was great the pancetta was so crisp you could mistake it for bacon (in a good way!).  
We were then set to order dessert, however, unfortunately after we had ordered the waiter came out and told us they didn't have any.  If you are only serving a specific dessert for a month why would you not make sure that you have that in at all times, at least for the month.  It was extremely disappointing because there are several amazing restaurants in the area (we live 45 minutes away) and I am not able to make it out here very often.  If I had known they were not going to have what they were advertising I would have headed over to the Gladly or Citizen Public House.",2
19491,2,1549843200000,"My wife booked this for her birthday and unfortunately we did not have a good experience at all.  Overall, I would like to say that all the staff was very friendly and pleasant. The decor and ambience were very nice. Unfortunately the service was extremely slow, like molasses, and the staff did not seem to notice that as they never apologized or even commented about the slow service.  To begin, we had waited about 20 minutes past our reservation to be seated.  The service then took forever.  The food was not very good. My son had the shrimp and it tasted fishy.  I had the cuttlefish parmesan and it seemed tough.  The mashed blue potatoes were too sweet and the presentation of it was strange (when you see it, you will see what I mean).  My wife had the black cod which good, but not much to it.  Overall, I don't think we would return.",2
19496,1,1548979200000,Went here with a bunch of kids during Christmas break. It was full of kids but our kids had a great time. Everyone seemed to get a chance on everything they wanted too and no one got hurt with there being so many people there. I loved the bounce room and the rope swings. We will be back.,3
19501,2,1550534400000,"I recently was here for a birthday and was pleasantly surprised for such a nice place along Babcock Blvd. The service was pretty good, although a little slow, but overall I had no issue.

The restaurant itself is smaller and more intimate and the best part is that it's BYOB. Because of it's size, many of the tables (including ours) are located near the door, which offered us a nice breeze of the cold, breezy weather each time the door opened.

The food: I ordered the hummus as an appetizer and while it was good (it's hard to mess up hummus), I was not blown away. It tasted like hummus from a grocery store that added a little olive oil on the bottom of the dish and garnished. Choosing dinner was a tough decision because the special sounded great (stuffed chicken), but I worried that it would be something the chef wanted to get rid of, so I ordered the lamb burger. I was pretty happy with the burger, as the lamb tasted great and flavorful and the feta cheese was fresh. The fries were good, but incredibly salty. Going back to the ""special"" comment ... my friend ordered it and it was exactly what I was afraid of. It was clearly ingredients that the chef wanted to get rid of. The chicken looked overcooked and was completely blanketed in a sauce that hid the dish. The portion size was small as well as the sides - mashed potatoes and vegetables. The overall meal presentation was terrible and clearly lacked any cohesion. They did not enjoy it as nearly as much as they hoped to, yet paid the full $20 (my burger? $9).

Here is where my review takes a somewhat downward turn and really makes me take the star away. I got the walnut cake as dessert after the server came back to tell me there was one piece left. This was an amateur mistake on my part as the cake was incredibly dry (although maybe the cake always is) and I couldn't stomach eating the rest.

Overall, I was pleased. Not sure I'll make a point to go back and I definitely wasn't blown away, but I didn't leave totally unhappy. If you're in the area and really want to try something outside of a chain restuarant, Mediterrano might be a good stop.",3

First of all, clean, clean, clean.  I hate going to a spa that looks like the floors or tables have not been dusted in months.  There was one guy, I am assuming the owner or manager wiping down the pedicure chairs and sweeping.  Rachel who did my nails put the paper towel she used that had chemicals on it, in a sealed water bottle.  I assume so everyone didn't have to smell the chemicals.  Rachel also was super fast and my nails look amazing.  Have to also mention Mela who did my pedicure.  She was awesome.  Can't remember having a better pedicure.  I wanted to fall asleep due her amazing leg and foot massage.  Got a bottle of water the minute I checked in.  They really take care of you.  This will definitely be my go to nail Salon in the future.",2
19505,1,1549152000000,"First off, location, location, location.  While it has the name, with this spot inside a shopping mall, you know something else make up for it.  Unfortunately with the rather loud ""Billy Joel wannabe"" pianist playing all night, and the shoppers strolling by looking at your dining selection, this place does not rate as well as it should.  

While the service was outstanding, the quality was mediocre when comparing it to other similar, better located, places in Vegas.  Price hurts a little too...guess the uberMall rents are high so the costs need to be passed along to the diners.

Since service is one half of a successful dining experience, this is what saved it from garnering a single star.

If you are looking for convenience and staying at Aria or Vdara, you could try this place....or you could walk a little further to other higher end dining experiences.",1
19508,2,1549670400000,"What a disappointing experience we had - I took my family for dinner last Monday (first night of the RNC Convention) and was looking forward to a wonderful meal. However, what we got was

 a snarky waiter, mediocre & overpriced food.  It seemed like many of the prices listed in the special came out to be WAY overpriced and I now understand why - a day after our dinner, it was heard from a reliable source (waiter in downtown venue) that the restaurant was jacking up prices to take advantage of out of town guest coming for the convention.  For locals that dine out often, this was a deplorable realization - I guess that is why there was a very long list of ""specials"" that the waiter was pushing, so he could charge at will for specific items.  I believe this to be true since we were presented at the end of the meal with a handwritten check - really?!!! 

As for the snarky waiter - when your meal is advertised to have spinach and it comes with a couple of measly pieces, your answer when questioned should not be ""Oh, it is meant to be like a herb"" or when one questions why the egg parpadelle is stuck together in 5-6 layers, your response should not be ""because it's homemade"".

Overall, very disappointed that a restaurant with this reputation would stoop to make a profit at the expense of loyal diners who will not likely return.",1

I've never left disappointed. Service is awesome. They'll happily remake you another drink if you don't like what you order. They can also adjust the sweetness level to your liking. My favorite is hokkaido milk tea with sea salt cream and honey boba - trust me, get a large size!! I also highly recommend their matcha milk tea, Okinawa milk tea, and taro slush. Their crepe is also good. They have a reward system through square up. Just need to enter your phone #. 1 point for each drink. 10 points = a free drink. The only downside is this place is tiny. They only have 5 tables and being an awesome boba place, it's always busy, so it's hard to hang out with your friends here.",2

I have StateFarm so I called them and they had two places they wanted to tow me to and I said no as both were like 1.9 star rated online, I found this number and they told me if I chose this I'd have to pay for towing (completely wrong point was he comes to me). So I hung up called him was a bit cautious at first as I saw no reviews but I let him come out-he made it in 2 hours. He found the culprit of my flat and did a permanent fix.

Ok... I understand that places are trying to be innovative with cooking styles, and making different things.... However, they should at least give you the option of condiments.

19560,2,1549584000000,"This place was AWFUL! Let's start at the beginning:  the first evening as I went to get ready for a night out I discovered the shower had little to no water pressure, so my beautification ritual didn't go smoothly. After we returned at 1 am ( been up since 5 traveling) we couldn't sleep because the people in tedium next door were having A party in the hallway. I couldn't call security because our phone was out, the entire time we were there. after a sleepless night we went to the cafe for breakfast but it was so bad I set my food back and just has coffee.  By the second day we were miserable. Unshowered and unrested we were very grumpy. First vacation we've taken in 10 yrs. The party next door continues until 7 AM the next day. When we got up that morning there was garbage, including an overturned plate of honest food strewn across the hallway. It sat for hours

The elevators were a whole othe issue as well. Rickety and sketchy describe them best. At one point a little girl was crying to her parents ""I don't want to get in here!"". They were filthy as well, garbage and cigs just sat there. 

The 3rd night we switched rooms due to our unruly neighbors. The water pressure was better, but partway through my shower I discovered some goo on the shower curtain. I'm pretty sure it was vomit. So I jumped out of the first good shower I'd had in 3 days. when we went to bed, exhausted, we discovered the heater only blew ice cold air. We turned it off and called for extra blankets. 40 min later I had to call again. 

I wouldn't stay here again if they gave me a free week.",2

My only complaint is that the sign said they were $2, but I was charged $4, and when I said something to the employee, she said nothing and just ignored my question and continued my paying process.  As good as the hushpuppies were, $4 for 9 of them is pretty steep.  Hope to catch up with this truck again and try the catfish.",2

My party of eight had a great table with comfortable chairs and a great menu selection -  that's where the positives end.  The food was delayed, very bland & inconsistently cooked from guest-to-guest.  Wait!...it gets worse:  we ordered a bottle of wine which arrived at our table already opened, poured, and labeled as opened from 3 days prior....LOL it wasn't even the wine that we ordered because the wine list hadn't been updated to reflect the current selections.  Our waitress was friendly and intended to be helpful, but was hopelessly clueless.  The hostess was more assertive to make up for the service and food errors.  She didn't divulge details, but apparently  the manager wasn't on the premises.

Additional items to note:  the restaurant was understaffed even with only a few tables of customers & the live ""musical"" group was horrible.

If the only safe haven from a galactic solar storm was in a shelter underneath Procare Medical Center in a hardened bunker.....I would prefer to be rendered to a cosmic dust before I go back to Procare Medical Center.  

I walked in at 0800 there were two people in the waiting room; a boy and his dad together.  I needed a refill on a  prescription.  I'm called back to the treatment room.  The tech/assistant sets his laptop down and tells me I'll be right back he needed ""to help this lady"".  He disappeared for 30 minutes.

So in that 30 minutes I got to hear the staff discuss the over/under on the Thursday Cowboys/Bears game.  Got to hear how Express gave an extra 30% off of their 50% black Friday sale.  I had the absolute pleasure of hearing the staff discuss a brewing Twitter war between a friend and her baby daddy.  Undisciplined, unprofessional and mis-managed.  

So I peek my head out and one of the staff members is sitting in the corner texting.  I go peer into the waiting room and there are now enough people to populate a mid sized Bolivian village.  

In comes my tech/assistant who takes my vitals and asks why I'm here.  I had already told him I needed to refill a prescription.  Oh that's right....well we will need to give you a drug test to which I reply ""fantastic"".  

He asked me if I was a professional gambler for a living.  Are you kidding me?  Why not a Cosmonaut or a Porn double?  How random is that?

Test taken, hand him  the sample and back off to the waiting room with assurance that the Dr. will be in shortly. 

10 minutes...nothing. 

20 minutes....nothing. 

30 minutes.....nothing. 

I peek my head out and the same staff member is in the exact same spot texting. 

40 minutes....nothing.  

Meanwhile the guy next door has seen (I counted) 12 patients.  People being taken care of left and right and I'm here with the door open looking like an idiot.  

I asked another staff member to please give me an update on when the Dr. is coming.  

The tech/assistant who checked me in is nowhere to be found but ANOTHER 30 minutes go by and finally a PA comes in.  By this time I can't find the words to articulate how pissed I am.  

She pulls out her pad and writes the prescription and says ""I understand you were back here long""?

If she was a man I would be in  Clark County Detention right now.  I could have hit somebody in the mouth so hard they'd have to drop their pants to chew their $%#^$& food.  

I was so pissed that I wanted to grab that jar of cotton balls, tongue depressors and Q-Tips that no one uses anymore and smash them off somebody's head.  

I literally wanted to walk to that front desk and rip every phone out of the wall, take a dump on both keyboards and slap those Starbucks cups right out of their hands and on the floor.  

Take my time destroying their copier and fax and for good measure smash the bio-hazard and blood born pathogen containers and not justify why to anyone.  Dare anyone to ask why and if someone so much as moves a premolar....beat their ass like corn bread batter.  

It boils down to this.....the urgent care model is a smart one but unsustainable if unmanaged, unorganized and poorly staffed (training).  I am happy to see Dr. Tran grow his business as a fellow small business owner but with success and growth you have to invest back into the business and ensure your staff and their collective professionalism and penchant for service moves the same way.

When we arrived I realized that our makeshift ""VIP table"" was a pub table with 4 chairs just off the main dance floor where everyone could just walk off the floor and take as much of our expense liquor and beer as they pleased. It was honestly the worst experience I have ever had paying that much money for the ""VIP experience."" There was no way to distinguish who was in VIP (no wristbands), and random people were just walking over taking drinks and beer as the pleased while the bouncer was taking selfies with the drunk girls at the table next to us. On top of all that, a random person (not VIP) came off the dance floor and started a fight with our party. I can't believe they would just not tell us that all of the tables were full and we would have booked somewhere else. Instead they decided it was a good idea to make us pay $200 a bottle while shoved in a corner (in front of the exit doors which was most definitely fire code violation). There is a reason all the other tables are elevated and separated from the main dance floor. To all of my friends that buy tables on the regular, I will be recommending that they should not spend the money here. However, it is worth noting that our server was great and helped us despite being pushed around like everyone else at the table.",2
19613,3,1550102400000,Fast service...for a basic pedicure and ur was perfect. Quiet and relaxing.  I actually just sat in the chair when I was done and just relaxed.  Loved it.  They were not pushy at all. Very polite and enjoyable.  I will definitely go back.,2
19615,1,1550016000000,"I'm saddened that I have to give a 3-star rating today for Rubio's...  I talked this place up to my wife, who before this day had never been there. The experience was decent, but the amenities and the prices did not meet expectations. The prices are very high for what you get. We could have gotten an appetizer, two entrees, two drinks and a dessert from other places for the price we paid for a salad and a burrito. And saying that the burrito comes with chips is an insult to chips. The plate had about 15 chips on it, barely enough to cleanse your palate. I don't remember the prices being so high the last time I had been there, but maybe I just don't recall. But the worst part is the bathrooms!  First, the men's restroom is massive and only allows one person to use the bathroom at a time, while the women's restroom has three stalls. Then, the soap dispensers were empty, the paper towels were empty and the WORST part...  Neither restroom has a changing platform!!  I had to change my son on the filthy bathroom floor!!  Nasty!  How can you call yourself a family restaurant, when you don't even have a place to change a kid's diaper?!  For the bathrooms alone I would give 1-star, but the food was tasty, which is the only thing saving this review.",2
19617,1,1549843200000,"Great coffee. I get the ""normal"" coffee, black, so this limit limit your interest in this review. Good, full, flavorful coffee, not bitter or burned. Also got the Muffin Top, it was OK, maybe not worth the calories.
Service is out of this world and always puts a smile on my face. This takes a few extra minutes in the drive through, but worth it. I am a regular twice a week customer.",2
19617,3,1549843200000,The food is outstanding. It may be a small menu but each item was tasty with complex flavors and aromas. The mushroom appetizer was so good.- I soaked all the sauce up with the warm ciabatta bread. Chef Tony has done a great job creating an inviting space with food that rivals restaurants in Scottsdale. I will be back.,2
19621,1,1550707200000,"This place just had a really inconsistent selection of food.  We went for the brunch, which ended up being $20 a person.  The breakfast was weird - the eggs were soft like I like them but had a strange rice-like consistency, the sausages were also mushy inside, and the bacon was not crunchy but not limp either.  The sushi was just eh, not memorable - it tasted like it had been made earlier and refrigerated, because it was cold and kind of hard. The shrimp was peel-n-eat, which is a good way to keep lazy people from eating it. The fresh fruit (grapes, pineapples, strawberries) were good, and so was the stir fried veggies.  The corned beef was way dry, but the BBQ pork ribs were pretty damn good.  *sigh* what can I say? After eating at Wynn the night before, TI couldn't even compare. We just wanted something quick before going to the airport, so I guess this place worked in a pinch. But, if you had a choice and wanted to pay something in the same price bracket, I think the one at the Mirage was much better from my last visit to Vegas.",2
19623,3,1550188800000,"We picked up dinner here last night. It was fairly busy, $5 burrito night. The food was very slow to come out of the kitchen was very slow. I'm all for fresh food but 18 min for 2 burritos is a bit much. The staff was in no hurry at all. The kitchen staff spent more time looking into the dining area than preparing food. There was no urgency at all with lots of customers waiting around for food. For a pickup meal this was not the place to pick it up.
The burritos (Burriot especial with steak) were good, but definitely not great. I had to look to find the steak, or see if I could find any in my burrito. There was some steak but far less than their marketing would suggest. 
The tortilla chips were delicious and the highlight of the meal. 
Overall, I wasnt thrilled with the sercice or the meal. I'll stay with Chipotle next time.",2

19636,3,1550620800000,"When I was a kid, I used to look forward to Friday night pizza parties at the local pizza parlor. Since moving to Arizona, I haven't found many pizza parlors here that mirror my childhood experience. That is, until I found Upper Crust. Upper Crust sneaks up on you. Literally. It's located in a small strip mall just off of the 101 and Cave Creek Road but the second you walk inside, it's a whole little sports bar/pizza parlor experience. To the right of the restaurant sits a dining room complete with red checkered tablecloths and family style tables. To the left sits a bar with at least a dozen flat screen TVs, several high top tables and a large bar top. It's the perfect spot to watch a game. 

The pizza is outstanding. It's large and in charge! One slice is probably the size of 2-3 regular size pizzas. It's thin crust with soft bread, gooey cheese and any toppings you want. This is the ideal Friday night pizza. If you're ever in the area, visit this hidden gem for some delectable pizza!",2

I honestly try to avoid going in line and try to use the self service center but that too had a long wait yesterday.

Swing by Red Shed. It's also one of the few bars you can actually have a conversation at some  nights. One of my minor complaints is the jukebox. If there is no songs playing..it's just that--quiet. And at certain points in the night, you can hear a pin drop. Lines for the bathroom is sometimes annoying and I've felt really bad for the ladies here who have sometimes waited 30 minutes before the line moved one person :P",2

The second time I came here was on Cinco de Mayo. The wait was an hour, but that was fine. We got a pitcher of frozen margarita. Except, it didn't come in a pitcher. It came in this giant clay vase. It wasn't very functional for pouring drinks into salted glasses, which is what some of us wanted.

I've gotten tacos both times here. The tacos are so good! There's this super spicy salsa that comes with it. It's too spicy for me, but it was pretty yummy.

I will say, the host was not a very good host. She was so confused and clueless. I've seen her multiple times now. There would have been a third visit here, but I had asked for take-out and she didn't direct me to the right place. She doesn't make eye contact and is very bad with recognizing faces. I asked her if we could grab a drink from the bar while we waited, she said sure. Then we went back to wait outside, and she told us to have a nice evening, but then was like, ""Oh wait, you're waiting."" I mean, multiple times we had encounters where she'd forget the question I asked.",2

I couldn't tell the difference in taste between the chicken, beef and fish tacos. The $0.50 extra for guac and sour cream was squirt of each (a la Taco Bell) into a plastic ramekin.

so i took our  little kitty kitty meow meow to the vet to get her checked out, since she's been chillin on our front porch, in our stairwell, and sometimes sneaks in my house.  she doesn't leave.  so i thought why not help her out, cuz she's adorable and needs a home.

this is the vet i went to.

what a great place.  everyone was so nice.  overly nice.  make new friends nice.  and they go over and beyond to make sure the animals are taken care of.  the hospital works a little differently than places you may have taken your pet to.  there are no previously made appointments, like justin said.  so i just put kitty kitty meow meow (yes, that's what her name is) in a cage and took her up one night to get her checked out.

the vet was thorough, kind, attentive, and accomodating.  a bit weird to be in one big room while they get checked out, but the cat didn't seem to mind, so i didn't either.

and the good news?  meow squared has no diseases, is about a year old, and has no fleas or ticks...and has now been vaccinated against the ickies that can get to kitties.

...and meow squared is not a she. she's a he.  oops.  what can i say.  i've done the arts before, i get confused sometimes.

The TV is super old and bulky.The bathroom is also outdated but it's actually clean. No fridge or safe in the room. I didn't go to  the restaurants and the casino;it was full of smoke and packed with very elderly people that act like they own the place. If choosing where to stay had been an option I would not have chosen this place. I can understand people wanting to save money but this isn't even worth the low prices. I forgot to mention that the room also smelled like a mix of chlorine and smoke and the wifi is $11.99 a day for only one device. Also, you can hear EVERYTHING going on in the room above/next to you. I woke up two days in a row at 5 a.m because the people above us were walking all over the place and making a lot of noise. Please don't stay here if you have a choice , do yourself a favor and go somewhere else, you'll be happy you did.

The servers are great and the decor gives the patio feel but  indoors. I highly recommend this place for a brunch date with your s/o or even with a group of friends. 

I particularly like their eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce is made with dill for a little bit of an extra kick of flavour.",3
19795,2,1549324800000,"So good I'm writing my first ever Yelp review!

I stumbled upon this spot after a somewhat disappointing visit to Saint-Viateur Bagel just a few doors down (apparently I should have waited for a fresh batch of sesame bagels), and ended up having THE BEST berry tarte of my life.

The chef/owner is super delightful and loaded me up with lots a goodies to take home after I told him how sorry I was to have discovered his shop on my last day in Montreal.  The berry tarte is still my favorite, but the mango and raspberry sorbets, brioche, eclairs, and chocolate croissants were all superb.  I also really enjoyed a thyme-seasoned croissant, which I ate with cheese and fresh tomato as the chef recommended -perfect for an afternoon picnic.

I highly recommend this spot - I'll definitely be back here the next time I'm in Montreal!",1

We arrived as Smoky's and were really interested to try the food since I have been smoking meat for about 4 years now and I know my smoked meats. We got the sweet potato fries which were totally fresh and just cut. The fried okra was out of this world! I have high standards and can normally tell when things are frozen and not fresh. This was not frozen and freshly made. I asked for some of the queso cheese on the side and it was also very tasty and not from a can. It was more of a beer based cheese dip but very flavorful.  And also got the BBQ salad to balance out the meal. Really cool display and for only $7 it was awesome! And the V and O slaw was the best! Thank you for not having a slaw with NO mayo! 

NOW TO THE MEAT! 
We tried a platter that had 4 or 5 smoked meats on it for $31 and included 2 sides and the corn muffins. Every single piece of meat was fresh and out of this world. And you didn't have to worry about paying extra for sauces(like you do at Black Dog). It was in bottles next to your table. We especially liked the Mango Chipotle and the Mostly Mustard. You could sample all of them and put as much as you wanted on the meat. And then the waitress was so kind to bring us cups to fill up the sauce for our leftovers. And we now have leftovers for at least 2 more meals for the both of us. 

THE SERVICE!
The waitress was fast and very friendly! She went above and beyond to help us out and was so easy going. We left her a nice tip! She seemed to be handling most of the orders herself and had a happy I am working here feeling. The manager or maybe cook came out after to ask us how we liked our meal. And not in an intrusive or robotic way that a lot of the chain restaurant managers come to ask about your meal. He was genuine and really cared about how the meal was for us. We walked out and both were blown away in everything we ate and the service.",2

Well, i placed my order with the very loud person at the counter, a dinner for two with a side order of honey garlic ribs.  I sat down and realized hey, it looks like they cleaned the place up a bit. They must have spent 10's of dollars on the transformation.  However its still disorganized as ever with storage in plain view of the customers and the constant chatter barking from behind the wall.  Then i knew my order was ready......  Perfect.  Got my order right and Got it to go, and for two of us, its not bad for the price.  It was hot, tasted fresh, not like blow you off your feet fresh but good enough to satisfy.   I've been here before and usually the restaurant is kinda gross but this time as i said, they cleaned it up a bit.  Not enough to entice me to actually take a seat and eat there, but they are getting better.  They have come a long way this year. There is still hope they can be a contender in my quest for Chinese takeout.",1

It was my wifey's bday and we were heading out after to drink so we wanted to do something light. We opted for the mac n cheese as we both LOVE it. They were so nice as to seperate it into two nice sized bowls with a piece of garlic loaf each. WOW!!!!!!!! I cannot overstate how freaking awesome the food was! Creamy with just the right hint of different cheeses, The pasta was cooked el dente and was spiral perfection. We also had the deviled eggs which were amazing. Everyone loved their choice. As we are a sharing group of friends I also had the tatter tots which left me speechless on how the right amount of crunch was combined with potatoey goodness. Sheppards pie was also super fab. We will be coming here again and again as the service was stellar, the food was out of this world great and the prices cannot be beat. with 8 drinks, mac n cheese and deviled eggs the bill was only $55!!!

Happy hour (3 PM - 6 PM) has some great prices for cocktails, beer, and wine. Pretzels with fondue are so delicious - soft, chewy, salty! Crispy shrimp are awesome. The portion size is good for the price and the aioli takes the shrimp over the top.

Tried some of the chacuterie meats, which were also great. Love the crusty bread they're served with. Will definitely be back for more good eats and drinks!",2
19825,2,1550880000000,"Not impressed! The hot and sour soup was a disappointment as was the General Tso chicken, it was over cooked and the coating was hard. I had the shrimp with garlic which was OK. What I especially didn't like was styrofoam cups for water, and no refills; and flimsy plastic forks and plates. And the soup is not served in a bowl, it came in a plastic container and we were given two Styrofoam bowls and had to pour the soup into them. Since the soup was scalding hot husband had to use several paper napkins wrapped around the container to keep from burning his hand! I can understand that Chinese restaurants do lots of take out but when you have an area for people to order off the menu and eat in they should have some decent dishes and cutlery! And to top it off my husband got sick during the night. His food poisoning lasted twenty four hours plus!!!",2
19830,3,1549584000000,"When I lived in Las Vegas I learned a few things about customer service and how people are treated so I like to exclude that when rating a restaurant. But yes it is bad here and unless you are at a high end steakhouse/other fine dining on the strip then usually service isn't the best. Some reviews have stated this is expensive, and I agree and disagree. This is expensive for Chinese food but cheap for Caesars Palace. My meal was $17... at Gordon Ramsey Pub you will be getting two deviled eggs for that price and at Nobu you will be getting hot tea for that price. You are paying for location and a unique food option as the other popular/decent Asian restaurants turn into nightclubs halfway through dinner (Tao and Hakkasan) which is just annoying. SIDE NOTE: if you're looking to get into Tao or Hakkasan nightclub you can skip the line by eating there first and they take you up the back way after dinner. Anyway back to the food, it's ok and worth a try if you keep in mind that it's normal to pay $25 for beef and broccoli because you're inside Caesars Palace.",2

19837,1,1550361600000,"I attended a private event at Sopra Upper Lounge on Tuesday evening, December 15th 2015. I foolishly thought my coat with belongings was safe in their coat check. As I tried to leave at the end of my night, my coat and IPhone was gone from their coat check. Between my Canada Goose coat, Iphone5s, and other items in it, including medicine, the total value of my properties stolen is $1,867.00. not to mention the mental anguish I've suffered as a result of both the theft, as well as Sopra's unwillingness to assist in retrieving my belongings. The owner Paulo, repeatedly requested that I not involve the police, assuring me that although the coat check was operated by the event organizer that night, the theft was caught on security video, and Paulo would personally do everything within his power to retrieve my belongings. Again, I foolishly trusted that the owner Paulo, would fulfil his promise, to at the very least supply me the video of the theft, if he was unable to retrieve my coat and IPhone along with my other belongings. Sadly the owner and bar staff have chosen to ignore my multiple phone messages over several days, and they've done nothing but give me the run around. I strongly suggest that you not support this business, which feels no remorse in supporting thieves who blatantly and heartlessly steal from their patrons, only a week away from Christmas. If you must attend any event at Sopra Upper Lounge,  do yourself an emense  favour and do not trust your belongings to their coat check. However, if your belongings are stolen from their lounge, involve the police immediately,  because I can assure you that any promises they give you of cooperation or assistance in retrieving your stuff, are hollow promises indeed. These fine people sent me (a single female 24), out of their establishment at 1:30 am with no coat, no phone and no house keys,  that's how much they care about their guests.

I arrived at 12:50 pm and no one was there to seat me and no one approached until the telephone started ringing and a man rushed up to answer it and take a pizza order, all while I stood there unacknowledged.  I guess the way to get noticed at Humble Pie is to call.

The server forgot to bring my companion's water and I had to ask for silverware and a napkin.  My companion asked for hot pepper for her pizza but it was never delivered.  After the food came, she got up and got the pepper for herself.  In general, we just didn't feel that the restaurant was paying that much attention to us.  

Getting poor service at a late lunch is something has happened to me before at various restaurants (e.g., Bistro 24 at the Ritz Carlton; Arizona Biltmore) and I wonder if the staff sort of ""lets down"" after the lunch rush and late diners don't get much attention.  I'm not sure.

They never bat an eye at short notice large orders. I've ordered anywhere from 5-100 pounds for immediate pickup and they've never had a problem having my food ready in a timely manner. A great choice for large gatherings.

Went for state inspection and oil change.
Pretty impressed with the staff's professionalism and the work they did on my car. 
5 stars to Brian and Mark. Keep up the great work.

2nd time:
It was my second time when I visited Aamco.
My car was making a loud noise for sometime before I called these guys and scheduled an inspection. Noise was so loud that I thought its some engine issue and I would be spending like too much money to get this fixed. To my surprise, Mark called me and told me that nothing is wrong with the engine ( appreciate their honestly) but it's the tires that had gone bad. They have those replaced for me with a full labor discount and I am just loving the drive now. 
5 stars to their friendliness, professionalism and service.
Trust me you won't regret their service.",2
19856,3,1550880000000,"The place just opened and I had fair expectations. I was there on their second day and again today.  I had a Philly cheese steak and an Italian sausage sub. Both subs were about as expected and would have been a lot better with different buns. They use those same hard buns that Jersey Mike's uses. It's what you see laying out on a buffet table, people put butter on them and call them 'hard rolls.'  The fries are fresh cut and fried in peanut oil, that's a plus for them.
They also offer fresh lemonade that can be purchased by the glass or the gallon. 

Otherwise the service was great-way too many employees, but I'm sure that will be adjusted. Everyone was courteous and friendly and apparently competent. 

A ten inch combo was just under 15 dollars, which I suppose is a little higher than average but I guess they have to pay all those employees some way.

I'll probably go again since I work and live close by, but I would go more often with actual 'sub'
buns.",2

My favorite is barbacoa bowl or salad. Always has great flavor. The chips are also quite delicious. Can get a little busy at lunch (although I think that is common knowledge - thought I'd mention it) - BUT that is because it is so delicious.

He reeked of smoke smell when he came back! The only reason I gave 1 star is that I have been in this place before and the manager was amazing and made the design on my finger! This guy gave me the usual looking design when I specifically asked for a unique design. When I asked if the girl who sits in front chair was still the manager I was told no the place was under new ownership. This process took 21/2 hrs. I don't mind that long if I'm actually getting what I asked for..... a pedi and a sns fill. We waited and waited. Another customer left because she too waited 30mins soaking & no service!,2

The crowd was a very interesting mix, some elderly folks enjoying a meal, some young couples on dates, and even a few ladies out for the night, but not at all the collegiate atmosphere that usually accompanies dining in the south side. Now to the main event: the pizza! Wow, was it delicious! Loaded with cheese, lettuce, turkey, and bacon, on top of a thin layer of tomato sauce, it more than impressed me (for those familiar, it tasted like a delicious turkey Devonshire sandwich)!

19946,2,1550361600000,"I can see that there are quite a variety of reviews on this site.
I'd like to tell you our experience and give you a couple of tips to make that First visit more enjoyable. I've included the BEST tip at the end to make all of your visits there a breeze.
Both my husband Rick and I have been patients of Dr David Stewart for 11 years. It takes awhile to make life long friend's and we are so grateful for this one!
Rick and I have both been through some tough health issues including cancer and chronic pain. Dr Stewart's forte is building those close relationships where he really knows and cares about our family. Thats important when unexpected crisis occurs. When one of us do need to see a specialist, Dr Stewart knows and recommends only the very best. We love Dr Stewart!
Because he is SO popular, we would recommend that you build a relationship with a PA. Our experience has been that should you need to get in same or next day, having a PA is ideal. 
We would especially point you to two that really know their stuff and are extremely valuable to us.( I'm sure there are more, but these are our Fave's)
Vivian Marcuzzo is a treasure. You simply can't beat her caring demeanor combined with an attitude that goes ""above and beyond"" in searching for ways to make you feel better. Love that lady.
Last but hardly least, is PA JD Michaels.
Are you looking for a diagnostic wizard who is tender ( for a guy!) to boot? This is your man.Great listening skills. I have never felt rushed.I saw him today, in fact. He had spent a long time days earlier looking over my unusual blood work to diagnose a disease that may have been missed. I am very hopeful this diagnosis will allow me to live life without the pain I've endured the last ?? years.
Thanks JD! I've made another friend.
So there you have it. My A Team of Professionals that have gotten Rick and I through some scary health challenges. Rick has made it 5 years to Remission despite the odds!  
Now for the Tip that will change your mind about the Communication issue. The Practice has put into place a very cool Patient Portal that you can access from your smart phone once you set it up from your own computer.( Its easy, private, with your own secure ID, like your online bank account)
Some of the available uses are setting up your appointment, getting test results, sending a note or question to your Dr, checking out insurance... I know there are more but its pretty awesome! 
I was able to check blood test results today.
Overall, I've found warm and excellent service at Desert View. Now, I am not one to write reviews, but this practice was worth my time to help all of you in search of a Drs practice.
After all, I once was in your shoes. What brought us?  We saw the Best Health Care Providers Issue, 11 years ago and picked it up.
Dr Stewart had won Best Physician In The Valley, Phoenix Magazine. He's pretty low key about that stuff, but I think his nurse Stacey may be hanging up the new ones. The rest, they say is history! :)",2

Work involved running a new electrical line from new water heater to circuit box. Price was what they quoted. No surprises. Happy they were able to get the work done. They know what they are doing and they do lots of work in my neighborhood.

Things sometimes happen in working with service companies. You may get bumped on your schedule due to a delay or something unexpected. You may get bumped if there is an emergency call like an older person with no electricity in the summertime in Phoenix.

No hesitation in using them again when a licensed electrician is required. Price was less than I expected. Happy I am not blowing circuit breakers.",2

My husband and I have had their guacamole, cowboy, Seoul, and one special burger (an outstanding fried green tomato/avocado/arugula burger).  My brother and his wife joined us the second time, both of them getting the hangover burger.  Their burgers are juicy and delicious, even if they only cook them to medium or well doneness.  I didn't realize the guacamole burger didn't come with cheese, so next time I'll add pepper jack for an extra kick.

And thinking of their fries and onion rings is enough to make me salivate. Their rings are coated with a tempura batter and fried till crispy.  Their fries are thin and very crispy as well.  While ketchup is a mainstay, I prefer to dip my fries and rings in their homemade chipotle ranch.  Yum!

They showcase beers from local breweries (Old Meck) and serve them in frosted glasses.  And service at this little place is super friendly.  We'll definitely be visiting Bang Bang Burgers more regularly now!",2

Every time we call them, either we do not get a response or nobody seems to know what were talking about even though we have spoken to many people from the hotel. I am very frustrated for the lack of customer service from this hotel.

I hope that my review will help those families or anyone and make sure that you check all your belongings or you might not see it ever again.

------------------

Here's my email to a manager at Trump:


Hi Tracy, 
My name is-------, we stayed at your hotel last weekend ( 10/03/13 to 10/06/13) on room 4419. When we got back to our hotel room on Saturday night, my daughter's bear is not in the room. I called the housekeeping immediately to inform them that the bear was missing and I was told that someone will call me back, around midnight and nobody had called. My husband then decided to go to the front desk and spoke to Magid (I'm not sure if I spelled his name right). He told my husband that process of where the linen goes after the housekeeper clean the room and told him that he will check on it and will personally call us the next day.  True to his word, he did called us and let us know that he contacted the housekeeping and where the linens are being sent and they don't have the bear.
My daughter has been crying and refuse to leave your hotel without her bear she named ""Poppy"". This bear was originally my eldest who is 14, and she gave it to her sister when she she was born. It is not a souvenir toy, it is a raggedy bear with only one eye. But my daughters loves this bear, and this toy travels with us everywhere we go. My daughter asked me today if the people from the hotel cares to find her bear, and I promised her that you guys are looking for 
Poppy. My daughter is extremely sad without her bear.  I am writing you an e-mail not to get any of the staff in trouble, but to please help us find Poppy. 
This is not about money or any other type of compensation, we just want our stuffed toy back.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my e-mail and I am hoping that you can help us,

The three bids were very close in price, but Rising Phoenix was the lowest.  However, it wasn't the quoted price that impressed us the most; it was the professionalism of Juan and his crew.  During our first meeting, Juan listened closely to what we wanted, asked questions, and explained the process and materials they would use to do the job.  He and his crew arrived when they said they would, were meticulous in preparing the site, and were efficient in getting the work done.  When the stain came out much darker than expected on the test area of the outside trim wood, they immediately consulted with us and found a different stain that worked.  When the work was completed, Juan came out to do a walk-around with us to inspect the work, which was excellent.  The site was clean (no drips, spills, or splashes on hardscape or plants) and the stained and painted finishes looked beautiful.  A contractor remarked a few days later that the painting was most professional because of how well it preserved the stucco texture.  We think it looks almost like velvet!

24875,2,1550275200000,"Sweet love, Sweet Nights, Sweet dreams...   This town is what it seems...

A modern hotel that reminds me of some of the boutique hotels on South Beach.  The modern Style of this hotel is extremely hip and inviting.   The rooms have an unique upscale feel to them.  The rooms are as cute as the pictures they use in their advertising.  I did not have an issue with my room other than it being a little small.  It was very clean.  I'm not a big fan of the laminated wooden floors in a hotel at all.  The noise carries.

The nice part about this hotel is that it is not too terribly expensive, and it is within a decent walking distance of most of the interesting places to go to in Old Town.

There are a couple of memorable things about this hotel.  One good, and one not so good.

My favorite memory about this hotel is the terrace outside with the nice fire pit that burned every night that I was there.  I was there in the cooler AZ spring time, so it was nice to sit out there late on a Friday night with my cocktail in hand and watch the party-goer's walking to and from the clubs in the area.  Oh, by the way, this hotel is situated in what I was told was the ""club"" area of Old town.   This might be a bonus for some, and not a bonus for others. 

Unfortunately, with all the modern updates, I guess there was nothing that could be done about the fact that the floors and the walls are SUPER thin.  As I stated above, the floor of the room I stayed in was laminated wood.  My heels clicking, the persons around me heels clicking.  I wondered if I was hearing noises from 2 floors away there was so much clicking!   I could hear everything going on in the room next to me at 3am in the morning.  And suffice it to say, they weren't in there having a Sunday-go-church-meeting.  I could hear the words they were whispering to each other - I hope you understand how crazy this was!   I had to get up and go downstairs and hang out down there until I felt the ""coast"" was clear.  This was a big downer for me on this hotel.  BUT--- let me say this, I started talking to the front desk staff and jokingly mentioned why I was down there and I thought I probably needed to wait a quick 10 minutes for the ""coast to clear"".  Not expecting anything at all, but when I got up the next morning, I received a nice generous note from the manager.  

All-in-All, I still enjoyed my stay here.  Do I think this is a place for kids, NO WAY.  A place for a weekend stay in Old Town for a bachelor party?  YES INDEED, me thinks so!  If you're on business, request the top floor.  If you are retirees on vacation - NO, try another hotel I reviewed in my list http://www.yelp.com/list/best-staycation-resorts-scottsdale.

Sweet dreams!

They were very reasonably priced for a counter service burger restaurant ($12-13 for double burger with fries), and the quality and flavors were amazing. I tried a double kimichi burger with a side of fries. I would highly recommend getting a double burger (1/2 lb.) because it's worth the little bit extra. The burger patties were extremely juicy and seasoned perfectly. The bacon fried kimchi was very flavorful and all of that wonderful kimchi flavor and bulgolgi sauce absorbed into the patty and made for a wonderful Korean inspired burger. The burger was garnished with some green onion and pickled cucumbers to cool your taste buds. 

I was also impressed with the side of fries. They were a generous portion and came out super fresh. I love fresh, house made fries, and that is exactly what you get at Bang Bang Burger.

Also, they never have the chicken ready and sitting under those heat lamps. It's always fried once they take your order. Can't get any fresher than that eh?

 Staff is nice, friendly and helpful with your questions. The overall look of the place is relaxing, contemporary and clean. I'll try their oven baked chicken next time. Looks good too. 

The only negative I could find was the price. For $20 plus tax, one whole chicken with fries and garlic dip sauce, I found it to be just a tad pricey and specially when chicken is their main and most selling product, it has to be a little, juuust a little less expensive. If u add some drinks, we're looking at close to $30 with tax and tips. Hmmm. I think I have to check the prices at KFC to give it a fair price review. Last time I went there was I think in 2002 lol. 

Oh and a tip: Consume the chicken over there on the spot. It'll be extremely hot bcs it just came out of the pressure cooker so just have to practice patience or cut them open to cool them down faster. If u bring it home, the skin (the highlight) might get soggy and most likely you won't enjoy the crunchy experience.

Bon appétit",2

The space is fantastic. Everything from the high mirrored walls to the tiled floor to the vintage French posters gave this restaurant an incredible feel.  The staff was welcoming and very professional. They made sure we were well taken care of at every point during the meal. The food was superb. The soup was tasty. The salad came with fresh walnuts and a nice simple vinaigrette.  The beef was cooked perfectly to temperature (medium rare or 'a point' as they say), a little tough to cut in a few places, but very tasty.  The fires were nice crispy shoestrings. The sauce may have been the best part of the meal.  I'm guessing, but mustard and tarragon with butter and perhaps ... I don't know, but it's fantastic. Once you're going, the juice from the beef, the sauce and the fat from the fries come together to make an exceptional gravy on your plate. Douse forkfuls of fries in this and enjoy!",3

I do like that you can get almost everything you need at this little market though and often wish I had something similar in my hood.  There is good representation of local producers for bread, eggs, dairy, meat and organic veg so you can have that small footprint as a consumer.

The food is really delicious and the service was outstanding. A special shout out to Monroe who was not only a fantastic server but hilarious as well. Food recommendations-wise, I had the LA Chicken sandwich with fries which are real cut potato vs frozen manufactured. Now that I've been twice though, I prefer the shoestring onion rings over the fries. My daughter had the hangover burger which is enormous and pretty tasty, per her. My husband had the green chili burger and said it was really good. Also consumed amongst visits was pork belly mac & cheese, Philly green chili sandwich (amazing), Blasted Cobb which has over easy eggs instead of hard-boiled, and the footlong grilled cheese baguette. That was the blandest of all but if you're looking for not spicy and not sure what you want to eat; get this. Get the loaded tots!!! We had the beer cheese with bacon and it was divine. All of us loved it. Now let's talk beer. The BB brands were all really good beers. Hubby had a flight and couldn't decide which he liked best.

This is the only decent  place Ive tried so far that uses the ""fill in a form"" system of ordering wherein you just fill-in a form specifying what you want and how much you want and just hand it to the staff and youre done.

The more common system where a waitress gets your order like in a regular resto is such a pain compared to this. You have to remember what you want, how much, while looking at the menu and this happens while she stands there writing everything up. No wonder service is never good at these things. The waitresses have to stand there waiting for a fickle customer to be through while other people are waiting in line suffering.

Inside this hopping hub inspired by the geniuses of Green is part bakery, part ice cream shop, and part coffe haus....sprinkled with brunch awesomeness in the morning and on weekends. This is my go-to spot for any sweet treat, because as my friends know I do not eat crap. I am now on primarily a low-calorie, low carb, primarily vegan/fish based diet. I watch what I eat and work out regularly.

How does Nami fit in? After a stressful day, instead of grabbing 5 beers and nachos, or a heaping 3 scoop fatty ice cream, I come here. I grab a 100% soy-based ice cream treat called a Tsoynami, which comes with dozens of variations made up by Nami. My personal favorite is The Doughboy, with vanilla soy soft serve and 100% organic chocolate chip cookie dough. Horrible for you? Meh, not great by any means. Better than Coldstone. Actually, you could probably have two Tsoynamis and be still way better off than anything Coldstone, Baskin Robbins, or Dairy Queen has to offer. 

They also have a very high quality coffee bar which provides basic coffee fair, along with a dizzying arrangement of baked goods all vegan friendly. The vegan doughnuts blow my mind. I have yet to dance the doughnut dance at Nami, but I can do an eye test and say ""I approve"".  Overall, I can't give this place enough love. It's super trendy, the food on the weekends (look at their menu) are so to die for gang...its delicious. Green is a business genius for concocting the awesomeness that is Nami. They have this man happy, and a customer for life. Enjoy, 5 stars.... for everything they have here. Just go, if you haven't been yet. Just do it already!",1

I liked petting the horses but once I got on my horse and the chaos and yelling started, I just completely freaked out and wanted to get off the horse.  My horse started nibbling on other horses.  Not everyone in our group are experienced riders.

Our group paid $89 + tax and gratuity per person for a 2-hour ride and lunch.  The whole process of booking the trail ride was disorganized.  I booked it a month ago and received a call the night before that the address we need to be at has changed.

One of the horse handlers almost got kicked by one of the horses when he was getting them out of the trailer.  The said handler yelled at the horse, ""try to kick me and I'll  kill you"" which makes me wonder how these horses are treated.

After 10 minutes on the horse, I was just not having a great time. So, I and another person (who also had a terrible time) in our group had to go back.  The handler mentioned earlier didn't assist me in getting off the horse.  He just told me to swing my right leg over the horse which I did and now I have bruises and scratches on my arm.

The salad was very refreshing and it had goat cheese on top.  The meatballs were tender.  The fritters were not fishy.  It was a perfect sampler for a group of 4.

We ordered a Poppy Burger with extra Poppy Fries, Kimchi Fried Rice, Crispy Pork Belly, Charred Bok Choy and Roasted Duck Breast.  My favorites were the burger, fries, fried rice and pork belly.   The burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The fries were crisp and came with a yummy cheese sauce.  The fried rice was not kimchi overload.  Pork belly was crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside.  We also got the Quinoa Fried Rice.  Honestly, it was too sweet for me.  It was my least favorite item that we got.  The duck was also on the sweet side.

For dessert, we got Chips and Ice Cream.  The chips were homemade but they weren't crisp.  There were 2 ice cream flavors: caramel/toffee and lemon poppy.  Both were good.  It was a great dessert for the texture and sweet and savory elements.  We also got the Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Toffee.  The cake was nice and hot.

Both times that I used European Wax Center, I got red pimples all over my chest and back. This didn't happen when I went to a wax specialist that used higher quality wax and who didn't rush through the whole thing by using larger wax areas.

The wax specialist told me she had never waxed a dude's front and back...that was a bad sign. She didn't even rub or apply pressure after ripping the strips off! And the person at the front of European Wax Center always tries to convince you to buy the overpriced liquids/gels that they have. I fell for it the first time and ran out of the entire bottle in 2 days. For women who wax small, less painful sections, I'm sure the liquids work, but for guys waxing larger areas, it doesn't last long.

For women who are waxing smaller areas, then maybe EWC is a good option for you. But for guys who need serious manscaping, I wouldn't recommend it.

33145,2,1550707200000,"I have pretty fond memories of Gallo Blanco, a modern Mexican food concept restaurant that adorned the trendy Clarendon Hotel in central Phoenix for many years.  It was a fun eclectic take on the usual Mexican fare, but affordable enough to attract a diehard loyal following.  I'd gone there a number of times for dinner and happy hour with groups of all different kinds.  So it was obviously quite a shock to find out the Clarendon effectively gave Gallo Blanco the boot despite the restaurant's runaway success.  Otro Café was basically Gallo Blanco's 2nd location serving many of the same items in a similarly modern restaurant setup over on 7th Street just north of Bethany Home.  Now, Otro is chef Doug Robson's one and only.  I'd actually never ventured here before but my date loves this place.  So a little Tuesday night dinner get together it was.

The one thing my date loves more than anything else about Otro is their guacamole.  I don't remember Gallo Blanco's guacamole being that distinctive, but I will admit Otro's was quite delicious.  I'm not ready to say it was better than Barrio Café's guacamole, but as traditional guacamoles go Otro's can more than hold its own.  I think it's the Cotija cheese that really sets it apart.  

For our main dishes, she went with a pair of Carne Asada tacos while I ventured into the unknown with a Paella Mexicana.  Paellas are more of a Spanish concoction than a Mexican one, but I've had really good paellas at Tapas Papa Frita in Scottsdale as well as a couple of places in Las Vegas so I was curious to see how this one stacked up.  Otro's version includes chicken, pork, chorizo, rice, and a garden of different veggies all mixed in.  It's also served with tortillas on the side if you want to make soft tacos out of it.  The paella came out very hot (scalding hot even), though not too spicy.  The flavor profile was quite impressive though I have to admit this paella was mostly rice and veggies moreso than the meats.  The portion size is more than big enough to feed two and I get that paellas are almost always dominated by the rice, but I guess I would've liked the meat and veggie proportions to be a little more equal.  My date gave me a sample of her Carne Asada taco and it was excellent.  She especially loves dousing her tacos with (what I believe was) the green tomatillo and lime sauce mix that they provide at the table.  You could pretty much put that sauce on anything.  Its that good.

No dessert this time as we were more than satisfied with the food we had.  The place was busy pretty much throughout the dinner hour (despite being a Tuesday in the middle of summer).  Our server was fast and friendly and environment was nice and relaxed.  Based on first impressions I would say Otro doesn't have quite the charm of Gallo Blanco, though the overall setup and menu are fairly similar.  There's no shortage of Mexican food choices (even in CenPho), but Otro has certainly earned its place as a neighborhood joint.  Otro has plenty of unique and unusual dishes to choose from, but I'd recommend sticking with Otro's traditional Mexican fare.  That's what Otro does best.",2

Firstly & most importantly to point out, they offer free coffee from 6am - 8am & when you're awake & nervous as all get out b/c of a certain *event* later that day, you're thankful you don't have to leave the hotel for a cuppa

After 8am, or if your fancy runs towards the espresso drinky variety, they have a full coffee bar that serves Illy Coffee & Illy just happens to  be my absolute FAV!

We had drip coffee on the 1st morning & it was completely drinkable; lattes on the 2nd morning & they were creamy & smooth - just like the Illy lattes I know & love.  Maybe another shot would have made it perfect but this was still 1 decent latte that I'd get again

Service in the restaurant was phenomenal - our waitperson was so incredibly nice & this made the process of waking up so much easier.  Also free papers were provided & we had our choice b/t USA Today, Wall Street Journal or NY Times

We both got omelets - mine w/ mushrooms & brie; BF got tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms & brie

Let me just say that the mushrooms were tender & nicely cut to have a good bite of mushroom in each forkfull.  The brie was a perfect accompaniment - there were huge hunks that must have been added right at the very end b/c it was just a bit melty but still in ""hunk"" form & I can never get brie to do this when I add it to eggs.....it dissolves completely & I can't tell I even added it.....so props to you!

Homefries also were flavorful - like tender roasted potatoes & the fruit cup was fresh & had lots of variety

Thanks for helping us wake up & start our day!",2

I started to cringe from this intense pounding noise and left with a headache. (see other comment from guest who said they ""jumped"" a few times due to the intensity of the noise made from the pounding/slapping of the dough against the counter). My dinner companion  asked a host or waiter if there was any way to lessen the intensity of the noise, and the host/waiter laughed and said no.

Dang! This place was off the hook and we got a good price because we got it through a Travel Zoo deal. 

The beds were super comfortable. The shower was huge like you can fit multiple people in it at once. The hot tub jacuzzi can fit three girls that are eating burritos while soaking in the jets--yes it's a little tight but you make it work. I really liked that our balcony had a view of the strip and that it wrapped around our room. It was a really luxurious space and perfect for housing a few girls in vegas for a bachelorette party.

As far as the facilities go, you can get to the palms hotel via a tube (tunnel) which isn't a short tunnel and can feel like a long walk during the wee hours of the night. Luckily they have airport style walking belts. At the Palms you will find a 24 hr McDonalds, Panda Express and various other restaurants in a food court.

46499,2,1550102400000,"My wife and I stopped here today after hearing good things about the place.   We were disappointed.

Although the service was fast and our waitress was very nice, the food was mediocre.

Firstly, the guacamole was obviously out of a container.  We suspected that they use the exact same pre-made brand that you find in the grocery store.    They tossed some fresh chopped onions and some other stuff on top, but they weren't fooling anyone.  (By the way, the charged more than 6 bucks for the stuff.)

Secondly, the chips they served were stale and under-salted.

Thirdly, the refried beans were also out of a can.   They had the EXACT taste and texture of the Old El Paso brand refried beans that you can pick up in any grocery store for $0.99 a can.   Of course, Cabo will charge you considerably more.

Finally, we have to talk about the fish tacos.   We tried 4 varieties of their tacos, and they were all bland and uninspired.   The fish was overcooked, the sauces were just gross.

They used fried flour shells and cheddar instead of traditional corn tortillas and cojita or queso fresco (which would be the more authentic way to go with this sort of fair).  Personally I didn't mind the flour shells, but my wife thought it was blasphemy.

Lastly, a word to the chef:   Wasabi and Mustard are not the same thing.  -- The honey-wasabi sauce tasted exactly like the spicy mustard you get from a chinese restaurant (which is generally just ground mustard mixed with water).  I could be wrong- maybe the other flavors screwed up my taste buds- but that tasted just like any generic honey mustard sauce.

I don't mean to bash these guys too much.   The meal wasn't awful- it was just awful for the price.

Also, I need to knock down their rating a little bit, because they just don't deserve their current 3.5 stars on Yelp.

My wife wants you to know that you can get better food at Chipotle.",2

I didn't compare prices.  I knew from the get go this is the company that takes care of there customers. They installed a water softener and a RO system.  Fidel, Junior and Javier were very considerate, clean and efficient. While they were doing the install I called Tom again.

Brad was the tech that called and came to my house. He checked everything out and per my request installed the air scrubber to my heating and cooling system.

Just one too many things soured my dining experience today...
...not certain I can go back. 

I walked in (admittedly towards the end of the lunch rush) and was astonished that nearly every table was covered with dirty dishes. Now I've worked in restaurants, I understand when you're hit hard it can be challenging to keep up with tables that need to be bused. I've also eaten in a lot of restaurants, which makes me qualified to say things like tables covered with dirty dishes don't scream ""welcome, sit yourself down, you're in for a treat!"" The waitress gave me a warm welcome, encouraged me to sit anywhere I wanted, but given my choices (a clean table or a dirty one) there were two... two tables in the entire restaurant to choose from. 

Things got worse from there. 

My egg roll was undercooked, cold on the inside and doughy. Why doughy? No clue. But doughy. 

The wontons in the wonton soup were melt in your mouth, and not in a good way. Melt in your mouth because the dumplings were overcooked. No bite. No chew. 

And while their version of Pad Thai was tasty, at 3 stars, which ought to be moderate was so spicy I had to ask for several additional napkins. Waitress must have thought I said several more spices, because she brought two over. Ironic. Unfortunate.

Also unfortunate is the fact that this place is so drastically different than LLXWilly. It's bigger and the hours are better, but neither are enough to make me want to give them another go after today.",2

It was my first time staying at a time share/condo, so I was amazed that the room had a full size refrigerator, fully stocked kitchen, dish washer, and clothes washing machine!  Also, the fact that it was a non-smoking hotel really saved my entire wardrobe/luggage from smelling like an ashtray and was nice for my throat and voice!

There were a couple of things that were negative; most of all the plumbing.  Our kitchen sink, bathroom sinks, and bathtub were all slow to drain and clogged easily.  The kitchen sink actually started leaking and flooding underneath, and the toilets took two or three flushes just to get the toilet paper to go down.  I also noticed that housekeeping never came in the three days we stayed there.  We didn't put any ""Do Not Disturb"" signs on the doors, so I'm not sure why they didn't come.  As a result, we had to call the lobby multiple times for things like toilet paper, towels, and shampoo.

Though the restaurant is pretty sizable (it takes up the whole lower floor under the club), they break up the dining areas using wooden screens, creating a bunch of semiprivate mini dining rooms. 

The variety of dishes was awesome, starting with vegetarian dim sum and Shanghai pan fried dumplings, followed by baby book choy in a delicate sauce, a dish with a variety of mushrooms, black pepper ""chicken,"" a noodle dish, and a tofu/Japanese eggplant dish. 

Our favorites were the dim sum (because vegetarians rarely get to enjoy this sort of thing - if they can add some veggie soup dumplings I'd be in heaven), the black pepper chicken (so much flavor and amazing texture on the chicken), and the tofu/eggplant dish. The tofu in the latter had a lovely fried/chewy texture on the outside but was creamy and fresh in the middle - probably some of the best tofu we've ever eaten. 

The service was professional and really unobtrusive. They would refill water and take away dishes immediately without seeming like they were hovering at all.

29297,3,1550793600000,"This place almost didn't get a review at all, but I'm glad I went back!  On my first visit I sat at the bar with some friends  and was met with a snobbish manager ( I later found out); he knew more than I did about everything and has done more than I have in life.  But this ""manager"" never asked about my food at all,  he just engaged in conversation when not appropriate.  Our bartender was sweet and provided good service and the food was great, although we only had appetizers.  The beer list is extensive and if you can't find a beer you like here, then you're not likely to find it anywhere.  

Last week we were looking for places that were open during the ice storm.  After calling around to a few places in the neighborhood we found Kickstand was OPEN!  We all put on our boots and scarves and walked there.  We were greeted by a very polite lady that told us we could sit anywhere that was comfortable.  (Later to find out this is a manger too, what a difference!)  This is where the review get's good...  You could tell they had shortened their staff because of the weather.  We didn't mind at all (we were staying there a while) what's better is, we didn't notice they were short on staff.  (this is the group of people you'd want all the time working here).  They got busy, but you could never tell, our waiter was attentive, polite and I couldn't have asked for better service.  What a difference a change in day can make for an establishment.  The food was excellent, I ordered a burger with pimento cheese (perfect for a snow day).  We had MANY cold beers, phenomenal (the guy was funny) service, and this time the manager asked how we were and how was our experience.  I highly recommend this place now.  All of the food looked great around our table and we all left full!  I'm glad I waited to review Kickstand.  You have my return business now!",2

26752,2,1550361600000,"I don't like that the two star rating for this includes (at least in this case) ""I've experienced better."" Its a lie! I'd have to say the last nail salon I went to was actually worse! And I've only ever been to two places as I'm not really a fan of the filing sound-- I think its one of the worst in the world!

Anyways..

I stopped in here on Wednesday 5/19 because I had a random urge to get my nails done. I walked inside and was immediately hit by that Nail Salon smell of acetone and other strong chemicals. There were two ladies here getting their nails done and a young man waiting (I'm not sure what he had done, but he was done in under 10 minutes once they started helping him). Five minutes into my waiting, a woman and her daughter walked in to get the daughter a full set. They were told to wait and that it'd only be a short while. 

One of the women helping the original two ladies was done and told me to go sit in her booth. I did some more waiting. The daughter of the woman who'd just walked in was taken by the other woman and helped before me (even though I was sititng in the booth already, I was pretty much ignored for almost another 10minutes). I was finally assisted the by the woman who's booth I was sitting at. She started filing my nails down and yet another woman walked in. This one said she wanted a full set and a pedicure, but only wanted to be helped by the woman who was working on me. 

I assumed this meant she was going to have to wait just as I'd had to. Oh, nope. Some random guy in a white t-shirt came out from the back and told me he was going to take me over at another booth. I was marched over to his table and the lady who requested my nail technician was being helped now. I have to say, this man was pretty nice. HOWEVER, when I'm in a NAIL salon and getting my NAILS done to look pretty, you'd think that the person doing them would take similar care of their nails, right? Yeah, well... wrong.

His nails were longer than any I'd ever seen on a man and there was dirt underneath them. His hands were covered in paint spots as they were in the middle of repainting the place. This was totally my fault for staying since he looked like a painter, had just been painting, and his nails were awful looking. He was also very rough and three of the fingers on my left hand are cut from his filing. Also, he worked fast and some of the nails dried weird. He also tried to charge me for the coat of CLEAR nail polish he put on last. I've never been charged for it before and this wasn't going to be the first time. I just wanted out of there. 

During the time I was here, there was a woman, her sister, and three kids. The kids were running around everywhere and had the people working there bumping into them every so often. This lady did nothing to discipline her monsters and even had the salon people put Pokemon on TV for them. Not just put it on, but on the highest volume. It was ridiculous. 

Next time, if there is a next time.. I'm going somewhere else.",2

One of our Greek friends tells us that the Kalamari and the Octopodi here are the best in Greektown, and to my lesser-attuned palate, I have to agree.

Entering through their wine shop, we grabbed our red blend bottle and headed to the table on the patio (most of the seating is outside). The patio overlooks all that is Vegas and Summerlin: a fake lake with McMansions on the opposite shore. Nevertheless, most of us enjoy being close to bodies of water (however man-made), and I am no exception. The multilevel patio was constructed with care and dollars, and it makes for a great dining environment. We started our meal off with a cheese plate that offered five cheeses that covered a nice spectrum of fromage. From there, we went straight to the entrees. I had the roasted chicken. While I largely ordered the dish to have a lower-calorie option (which I am sure was still packed with cals), the dish turned out to be amazing - possibly the best chicken dish I have ever had. I also tasted both of my friends' dishes (steak frites and halibut), both of which were the cat's pajamas as well. The only dig I could offer is that the staff was not entirely personable. The host acted like it was a bit of a chore to seat us, and our server half-assed it. However, the manager did make his rounds and checked on us, which I always appreciate.",3

A tad on the pricey side, but I suppose it's justified given the fresh/organic ingredients (and I'm cheap).  

The orange juice is ridiculously overpriced though - $4 for a smallish cup!  Didn't taste that special either.  Save your cash for more of the solid foods.

Popped into here after visiting the Warhol Museum. This restaurant is close to the stadium, but fortunately it wasn't crowded. The restaurant is very large and spacious inside. I imagine it gets packed during game days. We sat outside to enjoy the warm weather. I went for the Apple Raspberry Salad. It was crisp, sweet, a bit tangy, and enjoyable.

Why not five?  Because I expect nothing less than perfection from Chef Dante. But next to Pacific East, this is my go-to place for sushi, and now that I live less than 3 blocks away, I really don't know what will keep me from the extraordinary Happy Hour and beyond, every day.  Even guilt-inducing thoughts of dwindling fish populations barely registers on my normally moral conscience, when it comes to uni atop a cooked scallop.  Just ask Chef Taishi about uni (sea urchin) and his face will beam with delight, and he will chirp happily about how Japanese mothers feed it to babies. If you've never had sea urchin, imagine truffled butter with a hint of sea breeze slowly disintegrating on your tongue.  Yeah, Japanese babies obviously have excellent taste.  This, and the red snapper, are your best bets here, but sit in front of Chef Taishi and ask his opinion.  He'll offer you the freshest and choicest cuts.  

P.S. If you're a lucky girl and have $200 to spend on a meal or have a wonderful man who understands the worth of a $200 meal, try the chef's tasting menu.  If you do, throw in an extra $50 and get one of every martini (especially the Shiso Martini), and cram yourself into a table by the semi-arched, red-tiled walls.  This is probably as close as you'll get in CLE to the feel of an underground Tokyo sushi haven.",2

Hands down best croissants in the city! And this from someone who bakes her own croissants regularly. If they were a little closer I don't know if I would need to bother. 

They were flakey but not so flakey that they just crumble at the touch like some croissants. They had the perfect doughy interior with a great fermented flavour. Something that is lacking in many store bought croissants. And my guess is they use organic flour because I often can taste the bleach and a funny after taste in non-organic flour. 

So why 4 stars?

I also had a grilled cheese that wasn't bad but wasn't 5 stars...

I thought it'd be a good way to try their bread without getting a whole loaf and they sliced a fresh loaf but the bread had the wrong texture for grilled cheese and the cheese wasn't that great either. It had a taste that I equate with the taste of the rind from Brie. 

So I'd say go for the croissants!! And feel free to pick up one for me. :)

Located pretty far out on Boston Road near W. 130th is Z's with a very nice and big store.  They clearly spent some time and money building this place.  Inside is very warm and welcoming, a large dining area surrounds the counter.  You can get coffee, soft serve ice cream or homemade hard ice cream.  Although they don't have a huge selection of flavors, they do have some unique flavors.  I sampled the kettlecorn and had a cup of the dark chocolate and the maple and pancake ice creams.  The portion size is large, which justifies the cost of a double.  The ice cream has a wonderfully balanced base, smooth and creamy with a good mouth feel.  The kettlecorn was a nice representation of a flavor that should be hard to make into an ice cream.  The maple was very flavorful with nice chunks of pancake.  The dark chocolate was very rich, not as loaded with cocoa as some I have had, but very smooth and satisfying.

They also offer the cheetos snack frozen in the liquid nitrogen which makes you puff smoke like a dragon. It's a really interesting feeling and definitely a lot of fun to do with your friends.

The ice cream itself tasted great, but nothing special. It's the novelty of the place that brings you in. I think though, they should be a bit more careful with the liquid nitrogen as they don't appear to handle it with much safety precautions in mind. Giving kids/teens a cup full of liquid nitrogen with the cheetos in it doesn't seem like it would end well if you have a group of particularly ""not so smart"" people.

SITREP

Okay.  SRSLY.  I know most of you are thinking, ""Geezus, ANOTHER Starbucks review from this guy.""  I know, I know.  It might APPEAR that I'm just *dialing in* another review on such a ""hard place (NOT)"" to kick another one ottta da can.

But actually, THIS is the FIRST Starbucks I've ever visited OUTSIDE of the U.S.  So that alone makes it a special occasion!  

THE SETUP

After leaving the Calgary Airport (YYC) U.S. Customs area (where they verified my U.S. Passport), I went on this lonnnnnnnng trek through the International area of the terminal to find my United Airlines gate, San Francisco (SFO) bound (I think E90?).

But before that - soon after wandering through the duty-free zone (NONE of which I had room for in my simple carry-on bag...*dam*), I found this cute little Starbucks tucked away on one side of the terminal walkway through the ""E"" zone.
https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/starbucks-calgary-48?select=V18EtZDhYT7LCpHstp9G1A

MUNCHIE & REFRESHMENT!

I only had a little for lunch (since I had to dash to make it back to YCC to catch my flight) and it was already past 6pm.  

I checked my Starbucks Card balance, and I had enough for both a Teavana Refreshment Tea and a breakfast sandwich, so I grabbed them here.

However, there have been a few times where they neither show up or call to say they are not showing up. 

Like today for example. I call and they say no problem they have one in the area they would be there right away. After waiting for twenty minutes in the cold my goosebumps persuade me to wait in the vestibule for another ten minutes. I finally call back to say just forget it and the dispatcher yells at me that I wasn't there. I know where I was, I know where I told them I was and I know how long I waited, so unlike me I yell back. Hindsight that probably wasn't the nicest thing for me to do, but I was upset. 

I guess they aren't too bad if you find one of these at a cab stand, Most of the cars I have been in are old and poorly taken care of, but they do take cards.

So, when my epsilon had an eye issue I decided to seek out a mobile vet-I don't know why I didn't consider this sooner.  Dr. Kennaway was just wonderful and I would certainly patronize her business again without hesitation.  Prices were better than I expected for an in-home visit.",2

Little hesitation at hostess stand while she ended her conversation without even acknowledging our presence but once she hung up, we were seated near window overlooking patio.  I know the restaurant has no control over the plaza and the people that gather there but we watched 20 to 25 runners (?) warm up, stretch, swig water and spit all within our view point.  Was not able to see this until they raised blinds.  Staff might want to wait until runners have left area directly within eyesight before raising blinds.  Ribeye was totally different - chef removes outer fat rim and you are left with what looks like a filet Mignon but once you cut into steak you quickly realize it is not a filet.  Not sure if it was just this piece or this is normal (again have never seen a trimmed ribeye like this) but it was not as tender as a normal cut ribeye.  Flavor was good - blackening spices not over done.  Onion soup is heavenly but you can easily remove the first layer of skin on the roof of your mouth if not careful.  Wines by glass were a very nice selection - still can not fathom why reds are served at ""room temperature""  which is close to 70 or 72 - they should be cooler.  Spinach salad was adequate - bacon bits were akin to gravel but once pushed out of the way, salad was lightly dressed which is a big plus, not the usual drenching of the greens.  Waiter talked us into dessert because ""Mom"" made it and he was so right.  Best carrot cake ever.  Will be back soon.",2

48044,2,1550361600000,"This was my second time to Blue Hound - and I am a fan.

First things first - it's a bit hard to find due to it being in the Palomar hotel. Just go to the Lobby of the Palomar (which isn't at street level FYI) and turn right. Voila. You are there. 

This was the first time I have been here for dinner, the other was for lunch. So I waited for my friend at the bar. So, for it being a pretty small bar - and I was sitting at it - it took a long time for a bar tender to come and ask what I wanted. In fact, it wasn't until my friend got there that they even asked. I would rate the bar service not so great. Another instance of trying to do side work, and not paying attention to who is at the bar. And, then we ordered two simple drinks - a glass of chardonnay and a tanqueray rocks, and that even took some serious time to get.

For starters - I would definitely recommend them. Deviled eggs are awesome, although fundamentally a little odd to get at a restaurant and not a backyard bbq. Fried green tomatoes are delish and definitely try the short rib sliders. My only issue with the short rib sliders is I am not such a fan of the sweet rolls, but the meat is awesome.

For dinner, I think I am a little hung up here. I can't say I loved the stuffed chicken. (Does not appear to be on the menu anymore.) Turned out a bit dry for me. But the accompaniments were great - cauliflower, veggies, etc. 

Overall, it's a neat place. I like the setting, I am just not sure of the food. Appears to be a southern twist - so I am thrown off by the trout, shrimp, etc., as they just aren't my thing. But I think it's a good place to go for a drink and some apps.",3

There's not much seating inside and the lighting is very dim. The service was not great, as we received two dirty plates that we had to exchange and only 3 hot towels for all six of us. We ordered a ceviche for starters, which was $12 and contained a single slide of avocado with a few pieces of fish. It tasted alright, but wasn't anything special. We also ordered wings, which were more reasonably priced and tasted pretty good. For tacos, we ordered the big board, which contains 6 orders of tacos (so 12 total) for $78. I had one of the pollo asada and one of the chorizo taco. The chorizo one was a good balance of sweet and spicy and the yolk in the fried egg was silky. Overall the flavor and texture was pretty good. The chicken taco was alright but very average. My friends really liked the Korean taco. Our biggest critique was how overly priced nearly everything on the menu was and our experience was quite disappointing given our high expectations going in.",2

23905,1,1551052800000,"My wife and I were excited to be comped two meals as a part of their opening celebration. Even tho the meals were postponed by Black Bear (an air conditioning issue), we were happy to wait for a more opportune time. After all: we had eaten many times at the Tropicana location and were happy with the food and service. 

With ticket in hand, we headed there on Wed night, 08/24/16) and were seated right off. The place was lightly populated and we discounted this as it was still early evening.

We were seated and given a couple of glasses of tea where they must have just made a batch; there was ice in it, but it was melting fast. I asked for extra ice.  The waitress was friendly enough but I was convinced her mind was elsewhere. It took quite a while and I had to ask a second time before I got the ice. The food was another story.

The waitress took our order and we were not served until 25-30 minutes later. We chalked this up to my having ordered the fried chicken. My wife ended up with the lunch-portion of meatloaf: one paltry slice. I got three pieces of WAY overcooked chicken and had to send it back. It was black-burned in a few spots and had more tanning done than George Hamilton.  It had to have been dropped into a way-too-hot grease pan as the skin was literally burned off in several spots.  Interestingly, it took a VERY short time for a new dish to arrive with about half the overcooking as the first batch. (I suspect some poor soul who was about to be served was going to get his meal later than expected.) I held my temper and dug in. The chicken that I did eat was not bad but was a bit dry. Seasoning was good and the breading light and crisp.  The baked potato was just right.

The waitress came by and asked if I wanted a to-go box for the rest of my chicken. I politely passed. She asked another question then popped the same question again! (Did I want a to-go box?) All in the span of 40 seconds.  WHAT THE ....??!!??  Yes her mind was definitely not in the game.

We took our check to the counter along with the comp ticket and was asked by the nice cashier, ""Did you enjoy your meal?""  I told her we were bitterly disappointed. She offered to comp our meal until she realized it was free anyway. She offered some other opportunity to take home some dessert or other items, or I would I like to speak to the manager.  The gent standing 3 feet away appeared to BE that manager but he stood stone-cold-faced and didn't even twitch.

At this point, all we could do was decline. We called it a bust and left.  We'll give it one more chance--much later and after they have had a chance to get their schtick together,.  Time will tell and I will definitely post another entry when that happens. I rarely EVER give a restaurant a second chance and these folks don't really deserve one.

Black tea latte - did not disappoint!  The sea salt cream with the bold black tea work exactly as I imagined.  Went with 100% sweetness in this.

Hokkaido milk tea - a bit too sweet, but that's what it's supposed to taste like.

Also, we found chocolate in our pepperoni pizza. I'm not sure how/why chocolate would be near or around a pepperoni pizza but a little disgusting.

My friends from work have been telling me about this place for some time now (since they do it regularly) and so on this very evening, we were invited to watch their Sat 8pm performance.  We showed up and it was pretty darn packed.. lots of turnout.. lots of people coming to watch their family and friends perform - I thought that was neat.  Plus, they had the cotton-candy machine running (I think $3 ea) and popcorn, so it really helped set the atmopshere.  

We sat on bleachers and were entertained for a good hour and a half by the FOF (1st year, I think) and by the advanced students.  I was impressed with their work (hell, you won't find me trapezing in this life time!) and most impressed with the 'catchers' and how fit and punctual they have to be to do their job.  The two owners, as I understand it, were doing the 'catching', so obviously they are highly experienced to do the job.

Good time, entertaining evening.. and after the show, they had $10 fly-bys for anyone which I guess means you go up the stairs, get harnessed, and get to fly on the bar/swing and then flip and drop on to the trampoline/net they have below... they had a lot of people doing this after the show.

The food here is pretty good, fresh oysters though quite pricey, loved the kushi and the french kiss which were served with horseradish, lemon slices, on a bed of ice and four kinds of sauces ranging from mild to hot. The hot really is hot. Add with caution. 

We also got the moule et frites and the scallop on risotto. My mussels came in a huge bowl, really good portion for the price, lots of flavourful broth underneath, I used all the complimentary bread to soak up the white wine infused broth. Delicious. The fries were really short which was annoying but had wonderful flavour and were crispy but not overly so. My friend had the risotto which was nice but he said the scallops were a bit over done.",3

29575,3,1549929600000,"Had to come back and revise  because the same day I went in my nail broke a few hours later. I went back in to have them fixed. Raymond took care of the broken nail and fixed the other nail the original lady screwed up. So from my original post I will go back to the salon but only to Raymond, unless of course Jen comes back :). As far as the price I still believe the additional charge for gel nails is a bit to much, only because other salons charge $5 extra, and this salon charged me $15 more for my daughters pedicure. So Raymond made up for the mishap of the original lady I saw which I will make sure to never go to again. I have now learned to only go to those I absolutely trust, especially since it seems to be getting harder to find a good nail tech. 

So still did not get 5 stars for a few reasons:
   My nails are already lifting and its been a little under a week. And the price for gel add on. 



Original Post:

Will never go back to this salon. I went to them when they first opened and had a very good experience with Jen. I went back today for a full set and asked for Jen, which they didn't tell me right away that she was no longer there. They sat me down with another lady and said she was very good. Well I figure since she's ""good"" I should give her a try especially if they compared her work to Jen's. Well she did her nails completely different than I have ever had them done. And then they came out misshaped and different lengths. I told her one side was longer than the other hand and she blamed my nail beds. I have had my nails done for years and never been told my nail beds are shorter than the other hand. So I'm pretty frustrated by now. She then states once she puts the oil on they will look better and she would shape them...ok since she is doing everything else different she might know what to do....NOT!!!!!! she painted them with gel (which I didn't request) and oiled and said i was done. I asked her to shape them better and noticed there was a black spot on my nail. when I asked what it was she was like oh that's on your nail bed. I said no that is not from my nail so she filed it out and now I have a dent in my nail where that spot was. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME GOING HERE. Oh and they charge 36 for a kids pedicure which is way to much. And when i paid and questioned the price and said i was not happy nor returning they didn't even try to fix things.",2

I said I was vegan and he instantly knew what he was talking about. He said the whole wheat one aka the brown bread was not because it contained sugar.

Every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! 

As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! 

Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. 

The service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff.

Unfortunately for me, Jean Marc isn't always around when my pastry cravings strike (how dare he close his shop on Sundays!), and I need to fill that void. 

La Gourmandine definitely holds its own when it comes to the French pastry game. I've been here several times now and have always been fairly happy with my selections. I've never tried their desserts, but as far as breakfast pastries go, theirs are solid. The croissants are quite delicious -- buttery, flaky, and chewy like a good croissant should be. Occasionally I find that they are *slightly* more crispy and overdone on the top than I'd prefer, but it's not a huge deal. Their La Gourmandise breakfast pastry is probably my favorite...puff pastry filled with a not-very-sweet vanilla pastry cream and chocolate chips. So flaky and tons of flavor in each bite...it's divine. I'm not a fan of their signature almond croissant that everyone else seems to love...it's too syrupy sweet for my taste and I'm not a fan of the crumbly texture.

The pizza was lovely and they were very accommodating with microwaving it as we let it get cold (this was our fault as we waited for the candidate to leave before eating so the pizza was sitting out for about an hour).

When I lived in the South Side, I used to walk by this restaurant almost every day and sniff, ""Hmph. Hipster bar. Who names their place 'Dish'?""  It reminded me of an episode of Family Guy where Brian, Stewie and Frank Sinatra, Jr. opened a pretentious nightclub called ""Place"". In retrospect, I was being kind of jerk about Dish.

Thankfully, Dish offers fantastic food and service. When we arrived, we were about ten minutes early for our Friday night reservation, so we ordered beers at the bar. Oh, I should mention that one of the only reasons (besides a positive word of mouth) that Boy wanted to try this place was because they carry a wine whose label name is also Boy's surname. Holy potatoes! Of course we ordered a bottle of that red wine, which was very dry, and had a pleasant, mellow tannin. It's a good wine so if you want to know what it is send a self-abused stamped antelope (or DM) to me. 

I chose the mushroom soup (with crimini, portabello and black truffle oil) to start. I have to say... AMAZING. Hands down the best mushroom soup I've ever had. Boy? Hates mushrooms. One of the many people in my life who hates them, in fact. What is with you people? Penicillin is from a fungus too, you know.  I bet that won't stop you from taking it when you need it to save your life. Haters. 

For the main course, I had the stuffed veal and my date chose the steak. The veal was outstanding, tender, and I ate every last bite. My entree was accompanied by pillows of ricotta gnocchi and julienned brussels sprouts. Very tasty and surprisingly light for gnocchi. The brussels sprouts would convert any veggie hater into lover in two seconds flat. Boy (and I) were less than enthused about the steak. It was simply ""ok.""

Ambiance = Needs improvement.
Service = Very friendly, but slow and disorganized. 

Tavern Americana has a nice space, but it needs to be utilized much better.   There's a nice open wine room that is pleasing to the eye, but other than that and a couple of TV's, there's nothing to look at.  The walls are grey and plain.  A few photos or paintings would do a lot for the atmosphere. The acoustics are also awful.  It is loud in there.  The restaurant was packed, and hostess was trying to tell us that we could wait in a small ""lounge"" area, and order a drink, but I could only catch every couple words she said.  I know I'm getting older, but at 33 I shouldn't be freaking out that my hearing is starting to go.

Service was slow, and it was obivious the servers and runners were a little over whelmed.  We didn't have any major problems, but a couple of the tables around us were brought either the wrong food, or the runner couldn't tell which person ordered something sans a topping, etc.

The food is great.  It's a tad pricier than it feels like it should be, but the ingredients are all fresh, which makes the price very forgivable.  We had the roasted chicken pizza and a tavern burger.  The pizza was good, but a touch oily.  The burger was also good, but it felt like it could have used something to make it special.  The fries are awesome and served with a house spicy ketchup.

The good news for Tavern Americana is that the flaws of the place are all fixable.  Put some art on the walls, figure out a way to quiet down the background noise, and get a better system for running food.  Definitely would go back.",2
38100,2,1549152000000,"I like this place!

The sushi that I had was good - what made me enjoy it even more was that there was so much detail and care into making the rolls. Beautiful presentation! :)

I also ordered the mochi for dessert --- it was so cute how they made it look like a fish! 

As you can tell by now, I love pretty looking food. And what's so great about this place is that they are able to make their food look gorgeous AND delicious!  

Service here was also great :) Even though everyone commented on the extra food they give like the miso soup, fruit, and edamame, I couldn't help but feel so special every time our server brought those items to us. So charming!  Oh, and the fruit display was gorgeous as well :p

I really want to give this place 5 stars, but I'm going to be a butt and say that I couldn't go up to five because the table where we were seated at was a bit dirty. So really, I wish I could mark it as 4 1/2 stars.

But to their defense, I can be pretty picky and anal so ignore that part if you aren't so neurotic k? 

This place is great! I will be back :)",3
44702,3,1549756800000,"First off my general impression of the place was nice and unique. Unfortunately I am unable to say the same about their menu. Overpriced for small generic portions that don't have much flavor. Very few options on the menu to begin with and even few that sound unique or appealing, however, don't be fooled, you'll receive less than what you were expecting. My plate of the shrimp linguini consisted of four shrimp. Not jumbo shrimp or anything that would compensate for the reasoning but average shrimp. The dish itself was bland but I will give them that it tasted somewhat fresh due to the heavy use of cherry tomatoes. My spouse went with a classic fried shrimp and what's to expect but 5 shrimp and 6 onion rings, I couldn't help but laugh and appolagize to him for suggesting this place for an anniversary lunch. It's a joke and our waitress was nothing but impatientl and rude, when I asked her about a few dishes she responded to me like I was incompetent and spoke to me like a child. But on the other hand the host that greeted us was beyond amazing, when we walked up she was nothing but kind and seated us in a lovely area of the restaurant and assured we would be taken care of. Unfortunately that wasn't the case for us that day..",2

When I mentioned to the waitress about the annoying fruit flys she said she would tell the manager.  When she came out the waitress was very apologetic but said the kitchen staff was laughing.  Not what a paying patron would expect to hear.  At this point the entire party just wanted to leave the owner came out and offered a free cup of hot cider, when we declined she forced us all to take a sip.  Again super strange behavior.

26935,1,1550102400000,"We chose our usual as we were back in town.

As always a great time and enjoyed the night.

The Con's:

* The bathrooms kill me. Have to walk up stairs to the second floor. Not easy when you have had a few.

* Again, we got there early and decided to wait at the bar and enjoy the night. Only issue is they let all the bar seats go to diners at the bar, Thus no one waiting and enjoying the evening can sit for a glass of wine. 

The Pro's:

* Great hostess staff, very nice gals.

* Waiter and staff are great, Robert made sure we had everything we needed and check in at the right times. They have a very well trained staff, and support waiters, they always seem to be right there when you need something.

* Food is always top notch.  By far the best consistently good quality we have ever had at a steak house. (and we have been to them all). The are always right now with any special requests and its perfect.

* Wife really enjoyed the baked halibut special.

* They created our desert per my wife's request and it was perfect. 

 We are always excited to dine here. The best steak house on the strip by far. Many other known names, but few can make the whole experience as nice as Mastro's.",2

29122,1,1549929600000,"For the big 1000th review, I have to review Heist Brewery, a fairly new brewery in a place called NoDa (North Davidson) that I visited last week. My friend's loft is steps away from HB, and it is definitley a good and bad thing. Great since you can go anytime, have a great time, and walk back home, bad, I would definitley spend way too much money and pack on a ton of calories at this place!

Thursday evening, we had a table right next to the bar, so very convenient. It was a special night, as they were unveiling the beer tap handles. Professional photos were being taken, some delicious hor dourves available, and felt like I was in a monumental moment as people were purchasing glasses of beer as people cheered on. 

This place is a lot larger than I had expected, as there's a huge area beyond the front bar. There, you can see the brewery through glass, and it's a large open space of tables and bar tables.

I was introduced to the Moscow Mule, a Russian version of a margarita. It's also poured in these copper (or silver) mugs that keep the drink extra cold the entire time. It was AMAZING! Very addicting, as it's not super strong. The ginger beer was refreshing, especially with the lime provided. I could've drank these all night, and only $9!

We shared a bunch of appetizers, which they have a lot of unique combinations plus your typical bar fare with a twist (strawberry bun anyone?). My favorite by far, was my local friends' favorites as well, the 6 cheese pimento and sherried crab dip. Delicious, especially with the parmesean flatbread provided! I could not stop eating it! Their spinach and artichoke dip was just as good as well! I ordered the jerked chicken flatbread pizza, which was good, but I'd have to say the root beer BBQ duck pizza was even better! We also got the forked-up ahi, which also came with a wasabi soy mist in a mini bottle! How clever is that? 

Great ambience of locals dining and drinking, and definitley had a great night here that ended my trip quite nicely. Would definitley recommend this place and feel like one of the locals in the trendy NoDa area!",2
46575,2,1550448000000,"This will be as detailed as I can get.  
The review is mostly for travelers using Grayline to travel from Las Vegas to the Canyon.  This is not a one size fits all review.  Vegas to Canyon. 


Bus:
The Grayline Bus was really nice.  Very organized and prepared the day very nicely.  If you are traveling to the Canyon from Vegas, this will be a long day.  Food choices are McDonald's for breakfast, Pizza Hut salad and sandwiches for lunch and Subway for dinner.  These will be your only options.  Because of time restraints you will not be able to go to the other restaurants in proximity. (Strict rule) Also be advised, the bus has WIFI but only for 30 minutes. 

Tips:
Once again, if you are coming from Vegas, Call and make sure your hotel is a listed hotel for pickup.  If your hotel is not on the list, the tour company will assign you another hotel that you must be at the designated time.  Pickup times can be as early as 5:00am.  I suggest you pick a hotel in proximity of the tour start point.  We stayed at Tru By Hilton and it was about a $6 Lyft ride straight to the Grayline.  We opted to go their instead of being picked up. It also gave us a much need two hours extra sleep. 

IMAX Movie:
Unless you want to know how who discovered the Canyon and who took it over go ahead. For me, waste of time and money! 

Bus Tips:
There is a restroom on the bus. Lysol spray is for emergency purposes.  The bus is very clean but it is Flu season.
The bus has a plug for your phone but you need the entire plug and cord. Bring small snacks, ear plugs for your entertainment for your own equipment or just enjoy the movie, they played two really good ones. Neck roll or pillow suggested. You also can leave your things on the bus. 

Grand Canyon:
What a spectacular excursion.  For us, we preferred the upgrade to the Jeep.  Reminder, Time is limited we stopped at McDonald's for breakfast and our guide explained we could only go to McDonalds.  Please pack a book bag with simple items for your comfort if you don't like McDonalds.  I was upset about this part.  Their are way too many other options to be forced to eat McDonalds.  Modern technology provides us the ability to order on your phone.  These items can be ready and still accommodate the time restrictions.  Give Guys, Jersey Mike's and a few others are literally feet from McDonalds. The McDonalds was also unorganized and not prepared to receive over 50 people at once.  The line to go to the restroom was out the door.  Why people didn't use common sense and go on the bus is beyond me. 

Sunblock for the summer and warm clothes for the winter.  Please bring mittens in Dec, Jan, Feb.  they were so helpful. They also sell these items at the Visiters center. 
The Canyon is not what you think.  I suppose you can fall off the edge but you can get really close to the edge and there are three and four other drops before the edge.  Don't be afraid to stand close and take really great pictures. People who are afraid of heights can stand 10 feet from what appears to be the edge and you aren't really near the edge. 


Pink Jeep:
The Jeep was a great upgrade because of the small group of 6 and a more personable tour.  We were able to explore more and venture out with a great guide that gave us really good information.  Richard was a lot of fun and paid attention to details.  The small talk and conversation made it seem like he was an old friend we haven't seen in years. 

Recap:

Most importantly enjoy the ride. It's very smooth and relaxing.  Long but well worth the trip! A backpack with treats and water will keep you company.  Perhaps a good book would also be a nice addition to the trip.",2

38313,2,1550620800000,"They have Glory Hole Doughnuts here. That, in and of itself, is enough for a 4 star review. Since Glory hole doesn't yet have a storefront space, and I can't write a direct review for them without an address, I'm going to enter my Glory Hole Doughnut review here:

Oh. My. God. So they are called ""Glory Hole Doughnuts"", but my enjoyment of these doughnuts went well beyond sexual, all the way to religious and communing with the divine. 

I pray to the church of Glory Hole Doughnuts.

I'm actually quite bothered by the name, the irreverence doesn't suit the serious nature of these bad boys. This is a real triumph of baked goodness. I've only had the lemon meringue, and I don't need to try any of the other flavours. I'm sure they are great, and I'll list them in a second because they may be even better than the lemon, but I can say that this is one of those times that I may only have lemon for like the next 2 years, because I am already that addicted, and will be unable to try any others till my addiction runs its course. The lemon meringue doughnut is RIDICULOUSLY PHENOMENAL. It is a glorious triumph of doughnuttiness. It is a revelation. I really can't say enough about it. The lemon curd is potentially the BEST lemon curd I have ever had, and I'm something of a lemon curd aficionado. It's tangy tart sweet fantastic, and it tastes like ripe lemons warming in the sun after a light summer rain. The doughnut itself boasts a marvelous doughnuttiness, that perfect textural amount of give and resistence and chewy yum that makes a pastry so enjoyable when you bite into it. It's just plain tasty. The lemon curd and the perfect meringue complete the Glory Hole package, and it's simply magnificent in every way. 

Given the incredible wonderfulness of the Lemon Meringue, I do one day look forward to trying their other flavours: Maple Bacon, Coconut Cream, Apple Pie, Fried Chicken & Waffles, Cinnamon & Sugar, Dolce de Leche & Hazelnut, Peanut Butter & Grape Jelly, Puddin', and Smores. Holy. How did the world get this far without these flavours! Evolution is a powerful and beautiful thing.

Glory Hole Doughnuts are apparently still looking for a storefront location in TO, for now they deliver(!) by the half and full dozen, and are available at Thor Espresso and Burger Bar on select days. They Tweet @gholedoughnuts. Definitely grab one at Thor with a creamy Americano. 

It's rare that a bakery comes up with something entirely their own, truly unique and special. Glory Hole Doughnuts has transcended the standard whatever, and these doughnuts are something so high in quality, execution, and flavour, soooooo fresh and tasty and wonderful, well, I just wish them all the best in the world. Keep on baking, peoples! Everyone needs to try these doughnuts!!! 

PS. I am not crazy, I just really like doughnuts. :)

They do not make sandwiches for you - think H&H in NYC and you get the picture.

The line moves quickly, and you are treated to watching the people shape the bagels and cook them in the wood-fired oven as you wait.

My boyfriend took my car here while we were in a meeting at work so we could make use of time and get the oil changed before changing locations. Our meeting was across the street, so it was very convenient, and this place has done little services to the after school vans for the place we work. We picked up my car, and headed about our way since we had to be elsewhere. 
It seemed like there were no issues, however, 2 months, and less than 2,000 miles later, my engine completely shredded to pieces. The mechanic I went to over the noise I was hearing explained that the last time I had my oil done, the oil was either completely not replaced or not enough was put in. When I put oil in the car to check it, NOTHING leaked, which led me to believe that the mechanic I saw later was being honest (I did NOT go to the Exxon because I had a feeling I would get the run around). 
I drive a Honda, and until that time, I had no issues with it. I was so PISSED that I had to then spend THOUSANDS of dollars due to my oil not being properly changed (a $40 process, turned into thousands of dollars because I needed a total engine replacement). It seemed that everything but the oil was replaced properly, so I'm not sure what happened, but I'll absolutely never go back here. I will not recommend this place to anyone. DO NOT GO HERE. If they can't even do a simple oil change, they can't do anything. I should have gone with my gut and taken it to the dealership like I normally do.",2

38620,3,1551052800000,"I purchased my Grand Canyon South Rim tour downtown Las Vegas from a ticket vendor after getting a recommendation from our waiter at Smith and Wollensky's.  The agent at the ticket office explained the Grand Canyon South Rim tour and stated the tour would be a 12 hour trip and there was to be a continental breakfast and lunch provided with the price of the tour ticket and they would pick me up at my WorldMark Las Vegas Resort on Las Vegas Boulevard and pay the tour balance by credit card or cash to the driver.  Welllll as the tour neared, I called Airbridge The day before the tour and they stated I would NOT be picked up at my resort but would need to be picked up at the same time but at the SouthPoint Casino. So I told them this was not what I was told but no exception was going to be made.  To my amazement the pickup for the tour was made on time at 5:40 am and was told the balance due would be paid later.  So I am so far happy, but as we picked up other tour participants at 6 other locations we were informed that we were going to be driven to the main GreyLine terminal and we would then pay the balance due and be immediately escorted to a new bus and the tour would begin.  

When we arrived at the terminal we were stuck in the bus for 15 minutes while other tour buses unloaded and loaded.  When we were finally allowed to exit, we were literally hearded into a large room where we all were separated by tour type and then a further breakout by Hispanic and Chinese speaking people who were taken out of the room.  The last group of English speaking tour riders were then told about the tour and the process.  There was no continental breakfast included in the overall price, though you could purchase one in the terminal!.  Then they told us about the tour, we were to make a stop at the Hoover Dam for some quick picture (this was true), then we would be taken to the halfway point and provide a lunch (this was true), then we were to be driven to 2 different locations in the Grand Canyon for picture taking and souvenirs for around 2.5 hours (this was NOT true, as the total time actually ended up being 1.5 hours), we would then be taken back to Las Vegas (this was NOT true, as we were told we would be stopping at the same mid point location for a gas stop for 20 minutes and all on the bus could grab a sandwich, use the rest room).  The problem here was that we went to the smallest Subway sandwich restaurant I have ever eaten at, there were 7 tables trying to service 3 buss loads of people.  I was in line for 22 minutes, at and went to the bathroom, and we were there 35 minutes!  When we finally started the last leg of the tour back to Las Vegas, we were informed we may have to return to the terminal and driven back to our original pickup locations by yet another bus!!! 25 miles from Las Vegas were informed that the bus we were on would not be returned to the terminal and that our bus would drop us off at the origin pickup.  That was good.  I tipped my driver $7.00 bucks after being informed by the prerecorded message on the bus as we entered Las Vegas that $5.00 was ewhat each person on the tour should pay if they were to tip...

Now here is my synopsis:
1. Driver was not very informative and was not at all attentive to providing any historic comments.
2.  The tour took almost 16 hours from pickup to drop off, so 4 hours longer than sold!
3.  Tour curriculum that was sold was not what was provided.
4.  The bus issues, my overhead bin and the one directly across from it were broken, 2 tv monitors which were used to broadcast 2 very funny movies did NOT work, the seat belts did not work, the window 2 rows in front of us rattled and was very noisy so we could not sleep well in the morning trip out, the bathroom stank!
5.  Dropping off 50 people many non speaking English, was a bad idea as at both stops at the Canyon we waited one time for 15 minutes while the foreigners finally figured it out that they should return to the bus.  For $180 a ticket the driver should have escorted the group.
6.  The bus needs to be updated to provide electrical outlets for cell, ipad charging.

It's got that old retro style, and when that happens you don't know what you're going to get:   it could be a greasy spoon restaurant, or it could be home cooking that your grandma used to make you.   We were hoping for the latter.

The service was excellent, and the place was clean.    I got the steak and eggs with a short stack of pancakes.    They were excellent.    The toast was a little dry, but I didn't wake up that morning looking for a great piece of toast.   The pancakes especially hit the spot.

This was my first pregnancy and every time I came to her that I thought something was wrong or had questions she acted like I was wasting her time and that it was all in my head. I ended up with hyperemesis gravidarum and was so sick I lost over 40lbs. It wasn't until after I spent time in the ER and was down at least 35lbs that she finally helped me get in home nurse care because I couldn't even leave the house. 

Another major problem I had was that they never seemed to relate what was really going to be taking place. This happened before and after I had my son. I would be told that something would be taking place, I would move everything around make sure I had someone with me or whatever else I needed just to show up and they just wanted to have a conversation about what was going to be happening. During this time I also lived in the West Valley and had to drive an hour to the appointment. They called me 15 mins before to tell me the doctor wasn't going to be in. I was already in the parking lot, but they wanted me to come back the next day. Again I was very sick and my husband had to take off work to drive me. 

At the end, before I gave birth every time she would check me she would make comments well if you are 5 centimeters we are just going to go over to the hospital. Everything was about her convenience. I didn't even feel comfortable calling her on the ""birth line"" they give you so that you can contact her once you go into labor.  

I wrote out a birth plan and she didn't even read it. She had no desire to even go over it with me and I really wasn't asking for much. Example: I stated that I did not want any students at my son's birth and she still asked me if one could come in while I was in the middle of labor. I felt pushed into having my water broken, which resulted in me having an emergency C-section, my son didn't have enough time to turn completely. The whole experience was very upsetting and traumatic and I don't think I would have had the same experience with a different doctor.

I was hoping that the worst of the experience was behind me after I had my son, so I went back. Horrible mistake. I was having a lot of medical problems after I had him. My weight was erratic along with several other things and again she made me feel like I was making it up and I was done trying to convince my doctor that something wasn't right.

Since then I have moved onto a different doctor and surprise surprise I have a thyroid problem and PCOS. Both things another OB was able to pick up on after a single visit.  

If you are going for anything other than to deal with Dr. Brass-Jones I say take your chances. She put my life at risk, my son's life at risk, she was rude, and she doesn't care what you want or how you feel as a patient. For the type of environment they are supposed to be  or promise their doctor is a horrible fit.",3

Their fried chicken wings was also a bit odd - the fried wings were not seasoned. Instead, I had to dunk it into a sauce that was close to a Ranch Dressing. I never had anything like that before and thought it was just OK. 

However, given that the restaurant was packed with satisfied customers gives me the impression that this should be a 4 star restaurant. Maybe I should have ordered Pho as my reliable indicator.

Service was wonderful, old school steakhouse feel. Sam, our server, was attentive, helpful and a fun addition to the meal.

The food was great. As an appetizer we started with the shrimp and grits...yummy!We both ordered the filet mignon, the onion rings, and the mushroom medley. Everything was al a carte but just the right amount of food. We both left satisfied, not overly stuffed. 

The in house photographer was a strange but fun added bonus. She actually took really nice pictures of us. The only part I didn't like was the fact that she brought them back to us as actual prints. It would make more sense to have them on an iPad or tablet and then print the ones people want. It seemed wasteful and weird to think about where the prints go if we don't buy them. We bought one and the lady who took the pictures was really nice and not pushy about trying to get us to buy them.",2
20832,3,1550707200000,"First time in Canada for business trip...experience goes something like this. 

...Agent by Air canada check-in area...

Me. ""I've never flown your airline, which (of the 4 lines) do I go to check my bag. I have an e-boarding pass and a bag to check""

Agent...use kiosk to get bag tag,  then line 2. I go to kiosk get error message that basically says ""bring this print out to any agent...""

Me..wait in line 2.....Agent in line 2...""oh you don't have bag tag, go to line 3."" 

Me...""No, I have this piece of paper that says to see you."" Agent says... ""go to line 3 over there. Yes, that really long slow moving line."" (Yes, she said that for WORD FOR WORD)

I go to this long line and immediately woman in front of me says ""this line hasn't moved in 15minutes"". (When Canadians get mad, you know it's bad)

All this while the 2 agents supporting this line move at a snails speed, 4 others near these 2 agents do nothing but laugh and I guess discuss last nights riveting curling match. 

Luckily my co-worker gets the kiosk to work, I guess because he knew something that none of the countless agents standing around knew?????  

Never fly this airline, ever. 

Best of all NOBODY CHECKED OUR ID ONCE. Any where in the airport. Not bag check, not security line, the gate. It was a domestic flight, but seriously? My buddy shoved his ID in the agents hand at that gate and she looked at him like he just handed her a note in sand-script. Just a quick glance and gave it back.

The place is not a bar and they only sell beer to go here in growler form.  The interesting thing is that most if not all of the beer is from North Carolina which is great that they are supporting the locals.  They have a huge chalkboard with all of their options as well as printed lists for those of us who are vision challenged when we forget our glasses.

They will gladly sell you a new growler of several different types or you can bring your own growler as long as it is clean.

The staff was super friendly and is interested in any beers you might like to see.

I ended up taking home a 32 oz growler of Deviant Dales from Oskar Blues in Brevard but usually I like to have a pint or so of a beer before I take it home in growler form so unless they have something that is in high demand that I cannot get elsewhere, I am not sure how much I will visit this store.",2

We started off with the #1, Goi Cuon Tom Thit (Shrimp and Pork Spring Rolls) which had no taste not even the peanut dipping sauce that accompanied them, the rice skin was tuff and chewy. We then had #21, Pho Tai (Noodle Soup w/Eye Round Steak). The bowl came out piping hot which I loved, but the broth was dark and GREASY, there was 3 tiny tiny pieces of Eye Round Steak. There was absolutely no taste in the broth. In addition, #25, Pho Tai Chin Nac was exactly the same.

Then get the seafood risotto. 

If you're not a fan of the aforementioned (like me), stay away from seafood risotto. It was just plain bad. The onion and garlic lingered for hours. The risotto was hard to the bite. From watching lots of Hell's Kitchen, I get that risotto is hard to get right but for $26, I expected more. The seafood was also far from fresh. 

Apart from the risotto, the service was great and I dig the decor and the open style kitchen.

We ordered our food earlier in the day because my dining group had another activities planned in the evening and were short on time. The food was ready when we showed up even though our party was not. Mercatto was very accommodating of our request.

The place is quintessential Cleveland, perfectly nestled in Tremont. It's yet another independently owned treasure that has managed to produce a product that is so simple yet so superior to anything I've had in a long, long time.

The shop's decor is perfect -- rustic, minimalistic, and yet highly refined and quite chic. Just one stop in and you'll realize how perfect it's name, Churned, truly is.

The ice cream is obviously the best part of Churned. Brown butter with lavender brittle, peanut butter and jelly with sweet brioche, and of course, the Cocoa Puffs and Cap N Crunch favors are all absolutely to melt for. In total, there were about 16 distinct flavors, all of which seemed to consist of two main sub-flavors jazzed together with hints of additional and highly creative flavorings.

Natalie Pomeroy from the office mediated all communication and did so in a timely fashion.  It was not unusual to get several phone calls or emails from her daily and always with a positive attitude.

A girlfriend and I stopped since we needed dinner and a study break.  The place is literally on the casino floor with no barriers between you and the slot machines.  The sports bar is also nearby so you can hear lots of cheering (or booing, depending on the game and people) if there's an exciting game on.

My girlfriend ordered the chicken tenders and fries.  I got the beef brisket sandwich ($8.99?), fountain drink (makes me wish the M still offered free soda), and fruit tart ($4.99, say what?!).  My bill was $16 and some change.

Note, napkins are only available at the counter where you pick up your food, although plastic ware and stuff is located near the self-serve stuff.

Our food came out pretty quickly, just enough time for the two of us to devour the delicious and beautiful fruit tart.  My sandwich was huge, I could only eat 1/2 of it.  The beef was moist and tender and covered in just enough BBQ sauce.  This wouldn't be a good togo or take home dish though because the moisture from the meat and sauce soak the bun.  It was good, not great, but good.
The fries were hot and good.  I liked that they weren't overly salty so you can still salt them to taste.  
My girlfriend's chicken tenders were ahhhmazing.  We couldn't finish all 5 of those huge suckers.  They were so moist and had a perfect amount of breading on them.  

Next time my girlfriend and I go back, I think we'll just get one order of fries and tenders to split between the two of us!  And I won't order a fountain drink.  Just not worth the extra couple bucks.  But I'll definitely be back.",2

37590,1,1550448000000,"I had teppanyaki dinner here last night and overall the food was unsatisfactory so I won't be back any time soon. I already had a bad experience at the Matsuda at the Steeles location which I gave 2.5 stars to. However, I tried to have an open mind and enjoy the food.

The parking situation was a little iffy because they have about 10 spots at the front of the lot which were all full of course and the space at the back is all owned by a school which had ""Private Property"" signs all over. I'm sure it's extremely rare for someone to get their car towed there but I couldn't help but feel agitated thinking about it.

The service was much better than the other location because it was much less busier. To put a disclaimer though...the group I went with had regular customers so I feel that my opinion on their service would be heavily biased since I felt like they went out of their way to treat us better. However, I can say with confidence that they are not understaffed like the Steeles location. Orders were not missed and the overall atmosphere was better.

I found the menu to be lacking in variety compared to other AYCE restaurants for this price. The raw fish was not good enough even considering it is winter season so the quality in fish is worse than normal. The beef tataki was OK. I did not order any hand rolls. The sushi rolls were really mediocre. The tempura was way below average quality because the batter was bad and the sweet potato tasted strange. Their miso soup again was really mediocre. However, the fish/mushroom soup which came in a large pot they specially made for us (perks of going with regulars I guess) was delicious. The saving grace of the meal was the meat they used for the teppanyaki specifically the sirloin steak. It was high-quality, tender and cooked to perfection. The duck breast was not bad either. The dessert options are similar to the other Matsuda which all come in the small glass like mango yoghurt, jello and various mousses. Ice cream options were limited to vanilla, red bean, green tea and mango. I tried the mango one and it wasn't as good as the one at Ten Ichi but it did not taste cheap and overly sugary at least.

To sum it all up nicely, this Matsuda has better service than the Matsuda on Steeles but has worse food and vice versa. I would not go to either Matsuda's because there are much better options for Japanese AYCE for the same prices that do not falter in service and food quality.",2

It was embarrassing to me that a simple project had gotten so complicated due to my own ineptitude.

Anyway, they were really nice about it.  They didn't howl at my expense, although I certainly deserved it.  The mechanic came out, grabbed my bike out of the back of the car, and fixed it on the spot (and it was way more complicated than even he thought it would be, I had screwed it up so badly).  To top things off, even though it took him a good half hour, he was reluctant to charge me.  I insisted and we finally settled on $10.

We absolutely love this place! Their gelato is the best around. That being said, I feel like this place has gone downhill a little bit. Every time we go, they have less and less flavors to choose from. Especially with advertising that they have 64 flavors, they should have more than 15 to choose from, especially on a weekend.

24303,2,1551225600000,"I was in Las Vegas for a business convention and arrived at the hotel midday on Friday. Originally, I was given a room on the 15th floor, but when I tried to turn in for the night at around 11pm, I was awakened by a group of shrieking hyenas in heat. Startled by the notion that I had checked into the local zoo and not the Hilton, I went downstairs to the front desk. On my way down, I was shocked to discover that the mild, classy hotel I'd entered earlier that day had transformed into a meat auction, where both the goods and bidders were walking advertisements for Ed Hardy and the discount section of Forever 21. After a brief chat with Ray during which I explained my bewilderment and my necessity for sleep in order to conduct the back-to-back meetings I had planned for the next day, I was given a different room, far away from the cattle auction. While this made my trip bearable, the disappointments from this so-called Hilton did not end.

On Sunday, I went down to the taxi stand at 10am for a cab and found myself in a line ten people deep. I waited over 15 minutes for a taxi. I refuse to believe that mid-morning on a SUNDAY is Las Vegas' rush hour. Apparently, the valet service wanted to sell a party bus to the unsuspecting guests, and a slew of cabs suddenly appeared only AFTER the Hilton charged $10/person to a party of 7 to rent a limo. Thanks, dude with glasses for making us wait in the heat while you lined your pockets. Truly, a class act one would generally expect from an establishment as well known as the Hilton corporation.

If you're a 20-something with poor fashion taste and questionable judgment in the opposite sex looking for a regrettable one night stand, this is the hotel for you. Otherwise, spend your hard earned money and precious vacation time somewhere else.",1

I eat sushi on a frequent basis and I always make sure I order the dynamite appetizer; a baked mixture of mushrooms,seafood, masago and mayonnaise... Sooo good (when it is made properly). I ordered the dynamite and it tasted sour almost like fermented milk. I ended up sending it back and the manager (I guess) came out and told me he tasted the food (which I took bites off of and spit back into the bowl btw) and he said ""I tasted the food and I just wanted to let you know it didn't taste sour.""
#1. Don't assume that just because I am black I don't know what a proper serving of dynamite is suppose to taste like.
#2. I come here all the time and it has never tasted like that.

#4. What were you looking to gain from telling me my opinon was wrong?
#5. Are you paying for my meal?
To add insult to injury he asked us how many checks we wanted, we clearly said one, the waiter comes back with two and when we clarify again that we wanted one, he slams one of the check trays on top of the other, slids them off of the bar and then lightly tosses our final check in front of us.

I think last time the trivia was a bit hard and it was hard to not notice the scores of people looking up answers on their smart phones.  Luckily the phone policy has been ""reinforced"" or it seemed like it was.  Trivia should be better if you actually know the answers!  Not how well you can use your smart phone.

Anyways - I got there early and ate at the bar waiting for my friends to show up.  The barkeeps were nice and also let me change a tv to watch a different sport than they had up there.  They have a ton of tvs so it's hard to miss any sort of sports action going on.

Had the fish tacos, which were nice... I liked that the tacos were ""pre-limed"" so it had a good citrus kick to it (without having to get your fingers all limey).  Maybe it's just the laziness in me, but I appreciate when the chef/cook/kitchen says, ""this is what you are eating... you have no options""  I think there is a boldness about it.  From there it can go either two ways - you absolutely hate what was given to you, or bask in it's greatness.

Taste wise, I thought it was okay. The schnitzel itself seemed pretty normal. However, what elevates these things are the toppings. I had the Jaeger, and also tried the wife's Parma... both were good. They also have quite a lot of garlic, which I love (although not sure how authentic this all is... it was very different to the schnitzels I had in Munich beer gardens)

It's in a strip mall behind a Coco's on the southeast corner of Thomas and 46th street, I believe. The sign is fairly visible, and I believe there it's only a couple of stores down from the Hungry Howie's pizza place.

The guacamole is great, and they have a salsa I have not ever had before - they're like marinated peppers that are just so light and refreshing. The only minor critique I would have at all about this place is that I'm sure this place could make its own tortilla chips - it seems like the ones they serve with their chips and guacamole/salsa appetizer are some store bought tortilla strips chips.

Anyways, I highly recommend their fish tacos. Definitely the best I have had in Arizona - and probably anywhere else as well. I prefer flour tortillas, but you can get them on corn too. The fish is not fried - which is great - and there's plenty of fish, veggies, cilantro etc. You really have to try it!

For a while they were serving tortilla soup - I would get it every time! I imagine now that summer is coming around and it is getting hot again, that is the reason it is no longer on the menu - but it's so good I don't even care! Bring that soup back - it's so good!

The carne asada is very good too - but I actually like the soup and fish tacos so much more that I rarely get the carne asada. That should tell you something!

I have not strayed beyond those items listed above. Whenever I think about doing so - I just cannot get myself to follow through. Must have those fish tacos and guacamole!!!

It really bums me out that whenever I go to this place, it does not have any customers (or if they do, it's only like one other person/group). It makes me afraid of the possibility that they won't stay open for business - while I would hate to have to wait too long in line to get the food, I would hate it even more if they were to have to close down!

Last night a bunch of us went for drinks and Totally 80s Trivial Pursuit plus a few rounds of Mastermind (remember that game??) while listening to the sweet, sweet sounds of ""Everyone's A DJ"" (a monthly DJ night where each pre-registered DJ gets to play a 20 minute set). Among the fine tunes I heard were Phoenix's ""1901"" and Stone Roses' ""Fools' Gold"". Like, whoa. 

So back to brunch. I ordered the Veggie Eggs Benedict, which was perched atop fried tomatoes instead of english muffins and smothered in orange chipotle sauce, a nice change from the usual hollandaise. On top of all THAT we had grilled mushrooms, roasted red peppers, wilted spinach and a side of hash browns and baby greens.

They don't actually clean the sides of the pool so there is years of dirty scum build up.  The change of office staff is ridiculous.. nobody stays or else they leave or transfer.  There are car break in's as well but I rent a garage so never leave my car out at night.  I did get my car keyed however one day that it was not parked in the garage.  Also, had a problem with the upstairs neighbors and had to call police several times..  Sounded like the guy was beating up his wife and kids.  The management is very reluctant to fix any issues.  They will put a band-aid on it without getting to the root of it.  Am sure I have mold in the HVAC system and have started getting a sinus infection.  Going to get the air checked to see for sure.  But the management will deny any problem exists.. that's just par for the course.  I highly suggest you look elsewhere if interested in renting.  The appliances are old and there is also no garbage disposal or screen doors on the patio.  The garbage fills up long before it gets emptied and other people that are not tenants and own business are able to use it as their personal dump because it is not monitored.  The other issue is there are way too many people at the pool that don't live in the complex and that is not monitored as well.  The pool should be for tenants and an occasional friends or something but it is so overcrowded and you'll have ghetto people that show up and swim with no swim suit and just wear a tee shirt and shorts... even saw someone swim with socks on... gross!  The management does not monitor any pool activity not to mention the cleanliness of the water.  So needless to say, will not renew my lease.  Shame because I have made friends here but they are all sure to move soon as well.  It's a shame that the owner doesn't know how poorly this property is being run.",2

I hate being a complainer, but it was delivered 40 minutes late. The pizza was very cold, and the pops were warm.

I think it might have tasted ok if it was hot or warm, but because it was so cold the cheese was all congealed and hard, and the crust was soggy.  I put it in the oven which helped a bit, but it was still not great, especially considering the cost.

We strolled in, took a seat and hit the bar! Yummy, spicy enough, plenty of choices, I just can't stop thinking about it today. There are a few choices for Ethiopian in Charlotte, I like them all. But I might be partial to this lunch buffet, because of price and selection.

47610,3,1550534400000,"Meh. We ordered the lemon chicken and the orange chicken. We took the lemon chicken back because the sauce was very weak in flavor and had lots of clumps of a clear gelatin like substance. Even the overall appearance of it was not appealing. Kept the orange chicken and worked our way through it, although panda express has more flavorful orange chicken than this place.

A little weary though because you can tell they obviously use the same batch of chicken for all of the dishes, just drench them in different sauces. Since the lemon sauce wasn't as powerful as the orange sauce, you were able to taste the actual chicken better, and it doesn't taste like the freshest chicken. 

Maybe it's all in our head since we decided to read reviews AFTER placing our order and while waiting for our food, but we definitely will not be giving this place a second shot. You're better off going elsewhere. Hopefully I don't end up spending the rest of my afternoon in the bathroom. Fingers crossed.",2

DO NOT come here for all you can eat wings unless you enjoy waiting 30-40 minutes between each 'round' (in fact, the third 'round' is an astounding 4 wings served in an ice cream bowl). 

Our server was friendly, but barely attentive as we had to flag her down to order anything, including refills. The odd time she asked if we were ready to order, she would reply with ""okay, just one second"" and proceed to manage other tables (so why even ask us?). 

This was one of those rare times I didn't bother asking for water because it would only distract our server from delivering food, but in hindsight sipping on water may have made the wait less bothersome. 

Even though this place was quite busy, apologizing for extensive wait times can go a long way and prevent reviews like this; I will definitely not give this place another shot -- stick to the downtown location!",2

Their noodles was pretty good and the meal combos that they have back then was reasonably priced.

But I have seen ""under new management"" goes up for a few times and now even a SUSHI sign went up there...

I almost didn't go in there, as my phone was low on battery, I checked-in while still in my car.
I got the ""Maverick"" badge because of this check-in.

(Maverick - Because ratings are overrated, because you go your own way - and because you'll never lose that lovin' feeling for your city's rugged good looks. You're dangerous. Yeah, dangerous... and there's a badge for that.)

Well... Let's see if the rating really works...

The waitress gave me a menu and a lunch special menu.
The menus are a bit worn(?) and as it's a noodle place, the section of menu for noodles looks ""dirty"" and fuzzy...
I guess the new management has decided to go with the korean/japanese restaurant than the noodle place.

End up having a lunch special - unagi tempura set.
The side dishes that came before the meal was not good...
The edamame, a few of them has brown marks on it...
The deep fried thing (I guess it's sweet potato fries with tempura coating?) was cold and with a sour sauce...
And the miso soup has a weird taste. Like a bad fishy taste...

The lunch set, the tempura was nice, it's hot and crispy.
The salad has a citrus (orange?) juice based dressing? I don't like it and I love citrus flavour...
The stir-fried vegetable under the few pieces of unagi (bbq eel) was cold, and lacks seasoning.
The bbq eel was cut like the ones that you see on top of rainbow sushi, those thin slices.
I didn't eat the korean noodle ""japchae"" as they were sticking together so bad.

This place could be great if they focus on one thing, ie. the tempura.
And if they are korean, may be they can change it into a fried chicken bar (oh, I don't see they have the LLBO sign)...",2

It's not on the strip, which was nice. If you've been to Vegas before and have already been there and done that, then I would opt for a hotel off-strip like this one. This hotel does not have a casino, but if you want to go to one, you can take the little stroll to the Palms on a moving walkway. 

We stayed in the mini-condo room equipped with a kitchen. But I don't cook, and with all the great restaurants here, what's the point? I guess it's just to say that you had one. The bathroom was pretty cool w/a flat screen tv and frosted glass all along it, which is sexy since the bathtub is on the other side of the bed.

33202,3,1550016000000,"I opted to have lunch here after enjoying some early Christmas shopping at Tommy Bahamas. I could not have been more disappointed. The Hostess greated me nicely. I asked her if there were any Vegetarian options on the menu. She said ""oh yes.  We have several great options.""  I was encouraged. I asked for a table on the patio. The hostess hesitated then said she didn't have any available. Would I like to sit near the open doors. I agreed and was seated. She removed the cutlery and napkin from the table and left me with a menu. Not sure why. Later when my food came I had to ask for cutlery and a napkin. While I looked over the menu I noticed three available tables on the patio- two 4-tops and one 2-top. The waitress came by to take my order and just as I was about to ask about the table outside the Hostess sat a couple at the 2-top. It was clear my being a single guest was a problem for them. Carrying on I ordered a glass of wine and asked what she recommended for vegetarian lunch. She said the veggie burger was very popular. She left to get my wine. When she came back I said I would like to have the veggie burger. She said they were all out. They haven't been able to get any for awhile. Really?  What now? I asked about the mango chicken salad. It said it could be served as a veggie dish. She said all they do is remove the chicken. The price would be the same either way. Yikes!  This just kept getting worse. I asked her to request the price be adjusted to reflect the removal of the protein. She spoke to the chef and came back with a yes. Thus my lunch was a plate of lettuce with some strips of mango. I enjoyed my wine and tolerated the salad just in time for the next blow. Rather than ask me directly if I would like some more wine or anything else, the server asked me if I wanted anything as she was heading through the door to the patio. It was as if she couldn't be bothered with a single diner .  Despite my awful experience I left a 15% tip and paid my bill. Tommy Bahamas you need to do much better than that!",2

For instance to blow up 6 balloons that I brought from home for my husbands birthday *12"" balloons, helium grade* it cost me $8. That's pretty ridiculous. Also I am in the middle of planning a baby shower and upon looking around I didn't see much for baby showers.

Let me break this sandwich down for you. It has fresh smashed avocado on a delicious bun with yummy rotisserie chicken. But the thing that brings this sandwich to the next level is horseradish beet coleslaw. Who has even heard of such a thing!? The horseradish adds such a delicious kick that you feel it in your nose. I cannot stress this enough, it is damn delicious!

And their food isn't the only thing that is top notch, they have superb customer service. The manager recognizes me when I come in and is always beyond friendly. When I had one issue with an order they listened to my feedback and then provided a free future order.

Thin noodles were perfectly chewy, definitely recommend going that route. In comparison, the thick noodles seemed a bit more soft without enough chewy bounce back.

Overall, an average BB tea place but more spacious.",3

37358,3,1549238400000,"This review is for the service department.

Positives
- Friendly service advisors.  I mean, really friendly.  Great customer service training for sure.
- Waiting area is a palace.  Hungry?  They've got you covered cooking up made to order meals here!  Seriously!
- Convenient.  Just off the intersection from Scottsdale and 101.

Negatives
- Price.  I get it, I own a Lexus but does that mean an oil change needs to cost $100?  
- Price Part 2.  Oh boy, we've hit the 20k mile check up.  In addition to the oil change they inspect the brakes and test the battery.  Thanks, but $200+?

Overall there is nothing wrong with this location which is why I'm giving it 3 stars but I think I'll use an independent shop for the service in the future.",1

32093,3,1550275200000,"Update time! We finally made it back for dinner last night and suffered only an hour wait. Soul is a busy place, let me tell you. While it IS very small, I can see why it takes so long to be seated: it's not a normal restaurant where one would order their meal, have it delivered, eat it, and then leave. No, not at Soul. Once we were seated we ordered a round of tapas... which did come out rather quickly... ate them... decided we wanted to order more... and more. This is a process in itself. Our group of 4 agreed on 3-4 dishes at a time, probably totalling 8-10 tapas and 2 cupcakes during our visit. Soul is known for their sushi, but I personally thought the lamb skewers, brussel sprouts, pork tacos and fried clams (the special) were my personal favorites. Sadly I woke up in the middle of the night with a HORRIBLE stomach ache- a lot of fried food, and while it comes in small portions, it is deceiving. Beware. We have been eating a lot of meatless/healthy/raw lately, so don't let the size of the tapas fool you. That stuff is heavy. Ah- and how can I forget the fried goat cheese? It was divine. No wonder my stomach hated me last night. :)",1

34699,1,1549843200000,"Came with a group of 15 late at night after a walk. They were closing in an hour, and one of the staff warned us that we'll have to order quickly because last call is in 20 minutes and restaurant is closing in less than an hour.

It's quite a large restaurant, as they have taken over two units. The washrooms are in the basement, and it's a long walk down a corridor to the other end. Can feel quite sketchy. 

Since it was late, the restaurant was mostly empty. The staff pushed some tables together so that everyone can sit together. We ended up staying past 10, and they didn't rush us out.

The menu is quite large. Rice dishes, noodle dishes, curry dishes, meat dishes, vegetable dishes, and so on. Interestingly enough, several of the most popular dishes on the menu used descriptions such as 

""Number 1 Ranked to be World's Most Delicious foods by CNN""
""One of the famous Thai dishes in United States""

The thai iced tea and thai iced coffee are quite a steal at $2.50 for a large cup. Would be nice if they didn't have so much ice though; perhaps that can be customized if you mentioned.

I ordered the Massaman curry with beef, and I would say it was quite good. Very light flavor, with a little heat. Some others said it was too bland or not spicy enough, but I thought it was pretty good for my tastebuds. One issue I had was the curry doesn't come with rice; you'll have to order it on the side.",2

And since I didn't know it was an issue I went ahead and paid the $400 appraisal fee.  Then when they couldn't find a lender they ignored my repeated request for a refund.

Our hotel concierge recommended this restaurant. Our party of six arrived and the restaurant was at about 75 percent capacity. There were three large booths open and set for dinner. The hostess told us we would have to wait 45 min for a table until people were done eating. We asked about the three large booths and they said they could not seat our party unless we took two separate tables and split the group. 

We asked why we couldn't be seated at the large booth and they said it was against policy to seat six people in a booth for five. It was obvious the large booth would accommodate 6 to 8 with ease, yet they continued to tell us that we would have to wait for the other smaller booth. Go figure... We know the cherry creek grill in Denver very well (I hear it's owned by the same person) and decided they clearly don't need our business at either location in future.

She had gone into septic shock and cardiac arrest before undergoing emergency surgery to remove her dead colon. We were told that she was being sent to rehab to regain her strength and learn how to care for her ileostomy. 
Immediately upon meeting her doctor here, we were told that this is not a rehab hospital and that she will be lucky to receive one hour of physical therapy 5 days per week.  They don't even sit her up in a chair. In fact there are no chairs in either of the 2 rooms she's been in during her stay of less than 48 hours so far. How is she supposed to regain strength if she's lying on her back for 23 hours a day? 
When my dad and I arrived this morning her ileostomy was full and leaking all over her incisions. One of her wounds us still open and packed with medicated gauze. It is crucial that it does not become infected and yet we find the dressing over it completely saturated and green! 
We've asked for treatment plans regarding PT and OT but have been told that there won't be any!
It will be a miracle if she makes it home alive. I'm flying back to Denver tomorrow and it will be all on my dad to see that she gets proper care. He is 70 years old and suffering from his own health problems.

We ordered the street combo of lobster, crawfish and shrimp; along with the house fried rice and two coconuts. The flavoring we had was a combination of all the different spices called the urban mix, and our level of spiciness we had was mild; if you want to make it more spicy you could add more spices on the side as well. The crawfish and shrimp were really good, but the lobster was the best part of our meal! The lobster was what filled us up the most, put a little lemon and lime on it mmmmmm so good. All the time while eating our house fried rice, which included in it shrimp and crawfish. The coconuts were young and freshly cut open for the drinking, then after our meal we ended with eating the coconuts!

We explained we were new and he went over the menu, gave recommendations, and left us to decide. When he came back, we ordered the grapefruit soju (SO DELICIOUS) and the Family Combo. This came with four different types of meat - half beef and half pork. It also came with several side dishes - a veggie stew, steamed egg, veggies, melted cheese, small salad, and several dipping sauces. The waiter helped cook all our meat, asking how done we wanted it (medium rare). My two favorites were the Marinated Skirt Steak and Short Ribs: These were amazing. Super flavorful and extremely tender. I would definitely order again. After three meats came out, we were waiting on our fourth (the spicy pork belly). Our waiter seemed to have disappeared and another waiter stepped up to take over. He cooked our spicy pork belly, which was delicious, but I'd definitely order something else next time.

There was three of us and I discovered this after trying to teach my child about adding and knowing how we spend our money. I caught the lady from overcharging and she gave me a lame excuse.

We ordered fried gizzards and livers. The portion size was enough for four people. And they were fresh and seasoned well. We also tried their fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was flavorfull and crispy. The cool part was the waffles, you can have them plain or you can add stuff to them or top them with nuts, fruits and drizzles. We had ours with pecans in them and topped with bananas. Amazing! We also tried their collard greens and mac n cheese. The greens were nice and tender and the taste was fantastic.

30098,3,1550275200000,"I intended to go to Sushi Star, but ended up at a Thai place. Looked at that menu, decided it wouldn't work out, then found Pho Ginseng. 

I didn't know what to expect. It doesn't look like much from the outside. I'm sure many people avoid it because there's just a little door and you have know idea what's going on inside. This is one of those situations where you shouldn't judge a book by its cover (or door.) 

When I entered, I was surprised to see a very clean and comfortable atmosphere, and the place was almost full with working people. It's like a secret high-quality hideout. I was even greeted upon entering, which is saying a lot these days. 

I foolishly sought traditional Chinese and Japanese food items (that's how we Americans are trained), but found none. It felt risky to order grilled chicken and rice because grilled chicken often tastes dry to me. But I took a shot.

The bad news is that I had to wait 15 minutes, but you get what you wait for. Since it was takeout, I took the food home not knowing what to expect. It looked appetizing when I opened the box, but that doesn't mean much (well, maybe it does). Either way, visual appeal was a good start. Then I dug in ... and I couldn't believe what I was eating. 

You don't often find clean and tasty at the same time. In most cases, clean is boring and tasty is dirty. But this is one of those rare exceptions. The grilled chicken with rice was excellent. And the salad could not have been fresher.

Bookmarking Vila a few weeks back I finally got here to an empty restaurant! I thought it was a little strange, that was until we met the Lubka!!! That's where our experience took off!!! After being sat and shown the menus we decided to go with all recommendations from the waitress and owner.

Starting off with some great house made sangria we ordered the Portuguese Chorizo and Snails! Wow..... These 2 starters we're simply brilliant, full of flavor and cooked to perfection. Highly recommended!!!

For our mains we ordered Portuguese Steak and Paella Portuguese style. Both were great, my favorite  had to be the Paella. It seemed a little like a southern style dish I've had before just with out the spice.

Now this is where Vila Algarve shines from the menu Desert: Mascarpone and Home Make Cake.... I don't know how to explain these 2, other than Epic!!!! I'm dead serious Epic!!! Texture, flavor and simply outstanding!! 

I would also like to say Vila is a very kid friendly restaurant with High chairs and a small menu for kids. The staff were fantastic with my one year old. Also they said they encourage people to bring along there little ones.

Also after 8pm they have some nice love music. I did say at the start of this review it was empty, once 7p came around the place started filling up quick.

This restaurant is going to take off!!! Having a very international staff and grounding in what it takes to make genuine European food, Vila Algarve is high end food with group and family like atmosphere...

The dining room is very open but cozy all at once; it wasn't very busy, but there was enough of a crowd to provide a nice ambiance. I find it really awkward to be the only two in a dining room so some background noise is always nice. Service was outstanding. Our waiter was friendly and you could tell he was well versed in the art of fine dining.

Their beer and wine list had something for everyone. I ordered beer, she ordered wine. They were of course very good... it's hard to find a bad drink in downtown Madison. I've also heard that their cocktail menu is creative and delicious though I did not order one.

(Quick note: Everything here revolves around the sea. From the name and decor to the design of each dish. If you like seafood this is probably THE place to eat in Madison.) 

We shared a scallop plate as our appetizer. Two nice sized scallops, pan-fried with lardons and little diced apples. The brown sugar and brandy combo brought everything together. Tender and savory with the perfect sweetness to it. My favorite dish of the night.

I then had a crab bisque. Quality stuff. The seafood here is just so good. I dipped a little bit of their homemade bread in it, and I don't regret the decision.

For the main course she had the rainbow trout and I had the bucatini. Her plate was simple. Vegetables and a whole breaded trout. Simple, but the breading complemented the fish so well. Gave it a small crunch to each bite of light, airy fish. My plate had mussels and a scallop, and one giant shrimp all served with thick spaghetti noodles. I usually avoid spaghetti, but tasted as great as all the rest.

Finally, for dessert we had an upside down pear cake (served warm) with homemade whipped cream. Again it was, like every other part of the evening, perfect. Especially with a cup of coffee.

43376,3,1548979200000,"Travelled to the Grand Canyon a day before, but I appreciated more the view of the Red Rock Mountain.  

After a night in Las Vegas, we decided to go for a nature trip.  You don't have to travel far from the city of Vegas to get here.  

Not only will you enjoy the mountain view, you can hike, bike and camp on the sites.  From each stop, you need to read and follow the signs to avoid accidents.  Be aware that it's a nature park, and wild animals can be visible.  Be prepared with the scenario.  But while we were there, I only get to see a wild deer.  No snakes or squirrels present.

Wear comfortable and non-slip shoes.  Bring lots of water and snacks.  There's unisex dry toilet / drop hole to use if you have the urge, say ""nature call.""  I don't remember seeing a water sink or paper.  Bring your toiletries with you.

Bring your portable charger because your phone might loss power from using it a lot and taking selfies.  Watch your step cause the trek route might be steep or rocky.

The park fee is per car, not per person.  Paid $7 with a Las Vegas license plate, party of two passengers.  The visitor center is the only place you can buy beverages. So, before you start your journey to all the sites, make sure to bring food and drinks you need.  The route is a 1-way, no turning back.  Respect nature, keep your trash with you in the car, please.",1
31620,2,1549411200000,"Tay Do was my destination one evening after flying into Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport. Was Halloween night!

There were 3-4 other tables of diners when I arrived. Not seeing a host/hostess to seat me - I grabbed a table and waited. About five minutes later a little lady came over to greet me and give me a menu.

I ordered the Pho Ga - their menu lists it as being a ""cinnamon broth.""

35 minutes later my Pho finally came out. By far the longest I've ever waited for Pho. I was close to getting up and leaving and finding something, anything to eat - when the Pho finally came out.

The plate of veggies/aromatics had no Jalapeños and no Basil. Instead there was fresh Cilantro on the plate - I've eaten Pho at a lot of places - I've never seen that. I asked for Jalapeños and Basil - apparently they serve neither. The lady who was serving me seemed confused, I told her that the vast majority of Pho places I go to serve/offer both of those items with Pho. About 5 minutes later she comes out with a small bowl with some sliced chilies - they looked like they were some sort of Thai or Serrano chile pepper. Whatever they were - they were very spicy! Just the way I like it! She seemed surprised that I took the entire amount she brought and dumped it into the broth.

The broth was very different than most of the Pho I am used to eating. I could characterize it as being somewhat ""rustic."" Not bad - just different. Chicken was tender. Noodles were not clumped. Cilantro, Bean Sprouts, and Lime - all appeared fresh.

Cons:
- No Jalapeños and no Basil
- The bottle of Sriracha sauce was obviously stored in a refrigerator. I prefer my Sriracha to be room temperature. There really isn't any reason to refrigerate Sriracha IMHO.
- I hope 35 minutes is not the average to get a bowl of Pho here. That's a long wait for a bowl of Pho!",2

On the left: The ""I Can Has Bacon Cheezburgher?"" cooked to medium-rare perfection on the optional pretzel bun. A solid and above average burger for certain. Not quite on the level of Winghart's Burger & Whiskey Bar or Burgatory Bar, but also without the price tag that comes with those burgers. Head & tails above any burger I've had at Tessaro's! 

On the right: The ""Kielrogieretzel Sliders"" - kielbasa, sauerkraut, whole grain mustard, and cheese-stuffed pierogi together in mini pretzel buns. Yeah, those were about as awesome as they sound, albiet alsightly overpriced for what you get. I think I've found a new place to add to the short rotation.

20484,1,1549756800000,"As you can probably tell by my recent reviews, I've had a hankering for Spanish food lately.  Decided tonight to try Morcilla, given the great reviews across various rating sites and its a Justin Severino spot.  As someone who has been to Spain and Portugal a great deal, I have to say I was really disappointed with the food just not being authentic Spanish in any way.  I found the flavors to be pretty bland sadly.  We ordered the following dishes:

Serrano Ham (4/5) -- Was good serrano, but the amount for the serving was pretty small as compared to the same priced versions of the dish in Madrid.

Bacalo Croquetas (4.2/5) -- These were probably the best dish we at Morcilla.  Nice size croquetas and good quality cod.  The honey sauce was good, slightly strong, but a good pairing.

Jamon Croquetas (2.75/5) -- Would not consider these croquetas.  These were like one inch diameter balls that had a very hard exterior breading and minimal filling.  The aioli they were served on was an ok pairing, but the dish was very ""meh"".

Brandade de Bacalao (2.75/5) -- The bread served with the dish was a like a hard crouton.  The bacalao spread was very flat on flavor.

Octopus a la Plancha (2.5/5) -- Definitely far from authentic Spanish.  The octopus was tough, meaning it wasnt cooked properly.  Plating was sloppy, when the authentic version of the dish is so simply plated.

Patatas Bravas (2.75/5) -- The potatoes were not very crispy, but were very oily.  The aioli was average.

Charcoal Roasted Creamed Corn (2.9/5) -- One of the dishes that I have never seen on a menu in Spain, but decided to try it with local fresh corn in the region.  The dish was again average. Seemed under seasoned and bland.  Also though the temperature was off for the dish and should have been hot rather than very luke warm.

Costillas de la Matanza (2.7/5) -- The meat itself was real tender and good quality.  The sauce used those is overly sweet.  The crunch black olives just seemed like an off pair.

Churros (3.2/5) -- Churros were very good with the cinnamon sugar mixture.  The chocolate sauce, again, just was not authentic.  Brought the dish done.

Sangria (3.25/5) -- Adequate, but not sure I would order again at Morcilla.

Had extremely high hopes and cant say I would go back for a second round given the other options of proven commodities.  I really wanted to like it since I am a huge Spanish food fan, but the blandness of the food just really missed the mark.

I do think the inside of the restaurant is very well designed.  Intimate and warm.

So to wrap it up, the food was edible but just was mediocre.  A lot of bland flavors, under seasoned, and the biggest just not being authentic in any shape or form.  High expectations going in, but probably would not return.",1

36306,1,1550102400000,"3.5 stars for our maiden visit.  When we return it will be to check out their menudo and pozole.  I round up to 4 stars for anyplace that serves pozole all week long.  Plus they are SUPER nice in there and place is clean and new and family run - so why not give them a bit of a break? 

We both got sopapillas (really just a large tostada using a large, flat fry bread as the base):  one red chile and one green.  The fry bread base itself was five star great.  The flavored chile and beef and refried bean toppings were solid four stars.  But then to bury all that tasty goodness with a heaping mound of shredded iceberg lettuce and lots a poor quality, unmelted, pre-shredded yellow cheese?  I hate that!   I wanted to scrap off all that lettuce and 'cheese' (I don't like to call those pre-shredded yellow bits by anything other than their real food name, which is 'TYC':  tasteless yellow crap - you know - as in they put TYC on everything at Taco Bell - I hate TYC and I hate Taco Bell).

My other critique is with their squeeze bottle red and green sauces brought to the table.  The green sauce separates with the heavier parts sinking down to the bottom of the squeeze bottle and the watery liquid rising to the top - so what comes out us mostly watery green liquid.  That is WHY you scoop out salsa verde and serve it in a little bowl rather than stick it in a plastic squeeze bottle.  These folks are not serving it correctly  - the sauces are too watery out of the bottle.  Plus - the squeeze bottle red sauce is too vinegary for my tastes (I prefer more of a chile or smokey flavor for my red sauce).

I hope the menudo and pozole are solid (I'll make a point of checking them out in the fall when it's slightly less than 160 degrees outside) - as I would like to support these folks.  But I can't get behind food items buried in shredded lettuce and TYC.",1

So, We looked on line and happen to find the car we had no order in Scottsdale. 

Contacted by email and talked to James Hedland, who said they did indeed have the car we were looking for. Filled out the on line application for Credit with them and my Wife and I hoped on a plane to Scottsdale. 

James actually picked use up from the airport in Phoenix and drove us to the dealership.  Are you kidding me?

Once there we went over the car with James and one small piece needed to be replaced, by the time we went to finance it was replaced. finance was a breeze.

James then took us out to the car and paired my wires phone to the bluetooth, set nav features, went over the basics answered questions, and set up our 60 day check up with our California service department.

We will be buying another VW next year and we will be making the trek back to North Scottsdale AZ. and buy another car from James H.  He had better still be working there :)

Once you walk in, it's very cozy, not in a bad way. Walking up a few steps takes you to the main bar which is stacked with different types of vodka. The little mini chandeliers hang in between large mirrors. Walking towards the back you notice a Soviet era military coat, love this! There are tons of couches and chairs to lounge on and it was no problem for our large group of 15 or so. 

The vodka selection is extensive but they may not match what is listed on the menu as we were informed that many on the menu had run out. But the bartenders were great! I watched them pour each drink and every one of them was more than an ounce of vodka. More like all vodka, splash of [blank], which is how all drinks should be.

There weren't as many vodkas as competitor vodka bar Pravda has but there are many different kinds. From the organic vodka from Oregon called Square One to the Roberto Cavalli Vodka. 

While seated, our server brought us little snacks. Some pickles, some bread and lots of corn nuts. I love corn nuts! The bread was gross, do not eat it but the pickles and corn nuts were so good, especially with a drink in hand.

Our server was pretty consistent with checking with us and bringing more drinks and remembering individual's tabs. It was a great atmosphere with splashes of USSR, there was even an ancient cash register in the back by the couches. There is a 2nd bar in the back but it only opens on busier nights.

Not an ounce of snottiness or douchebaggery in this place, although I'd have to come on a busier weekend night to really tell. But as far as I'm concerned, this place is better than Pravda, aside from the minimal vodka choices in comparison.",3

31384,2,1549497600000,"I just got off the phone with Michelle, an employee at Get Air. I am very disappointed and infuriated with not only their customer service, but the fact that they don't honor what they posted on the party packages. I called asking her about the 50% off party packages they were advertising; for her to say she will see into that and hung up on me. I called back and she acted as if it wasn't her who I had spoken with. She responded by saying there are a lot of employees, it could have been anyone. (Mind you, I called as soon as it opened at 10am, so there aren't even that many customers to which they need that many employees, but that's besides the point)
She finally answered my initial question that they don't have that offer anywhere. Which I told her I actually screenshot it. She said her manager was right next to her and said the same thing. She asked me exactly where that deal was, which I told her several times it was on their Facebook page. 
She then starts telling me in a rude manner other options I have, either Groupon or their actual packages in store. I replied with why they have that promotion and to call now for that deal if they won't honor it. If this incident happened with just a phone call, imagine if I actually book them for my son's party. Very unprofessional and a lying company. I will make sure to tell all the people I know to never step foot there or book any party. Thank you Get Air for proving to me you are not worth our time and money. Your loss! At least LOL Kids Club is around the corner and my son's bday party their was a blast! I highly recommend that place.

Update 04/29/18: Chad has gone above and beyond in accommodating my son's bday birthday that is coming up soon. I may have had a bad experience with the corporate office but Chad the owner has far surpassed all of that and found an awesome solution. I can't wait for my son's 6th birthday party now!!!",2

I couldn't stand up straight and when I was lying in bed and would go to roll over on my side I could barely do it. Dad called Helvig and got me in the same day. It was a Saturday he just happen to be there and made an exception to see me. Thank goodness he did. I have had three treatments I am all better now. He told me that I am over the worst of it so I don't need to come in anymore until I have an issue again. I feel as tho just because I feel better doesn't mean I should stop going I plan on seeing him every two weeks at least. I also had a burning down the front of my left leg that is now gone. There is a wonderful woman that does massage there as well that is great. Dana sue she rents a space from him but I think it's great to have someone right there that u can see.

42325,3,1550966400000,"This place is more like a 2.5 but can easily be a three if they get a proper barista. Coffee is very important to me for a brunch which is why the rating is so low though the food was good.

We went for brunch and it was pretty good. We ordered the Chicken and Waffles and the Harlem Benny. My guy enjoyed his brunch item but I'm a little more picky. I really think instead of serving the sauces in plastic cups, HU might invest in some nice steel cups or even just drizzle the sauces directly on the meal. The plastic cups just make the whole thing look cheap. I have a feeling the gravy served was of the packet variety, homemade gravy tastes a little more fuller than the packaged variety (I could be wrong).

My chicken was cooked perfectly and the waffle was soft and spongy, a nice contrast to the crispy chicken. I really enjoyed the scotch bonnet syrup!

On to the coffee. I ordered a latte and he ordered his regular black drip. His coffee tasted pretty awful, and it was just black drip. My latte was way too milky, not foamed properly and the espresso was weak (as in I didn't taste any).

Service was decent as the restaurant was pretty empty. So hire a better barista (or train staff better) and stop using cheap plastic cups.",2

I had the ""famous"" butter chicken which was quite tasty (and they allowed me to order the lunch special after hours, not bad), my wife had a chicken tikka sandwich. Both of us were quite happy, though as I recall it was the fries that she liked more than anything else, which seems almost strange.

My review here is to specifically commend the staff for accommodating a late-evening post-event celebration for our volunteer organization on 10/14/17.  They stayed open late for us (we booked this ahead of time) and the staff were cheerful and efficient.  Full menu was available even so late.

Our server was nice and to the point, got us some drinks, chips, salsa and guac faster than you can blink. They make the guac table side which is always fun, but they may want to consider adding a touch of salt in the mix.

I had the beef tacos and the beef was really flavorful. It had some avocado and either onions and tomatoes or something like a pico de gallo since I think there were some jalapenos in the mix as well. Either way it was good and fresh.  The rice side was good too, nice and aldente unlike some other places that serve mush. The two others had the cilantro and pollo salad and the mango salad and both were impressed and full. These salads were huge.

We sat and talked for a while and our server didn't bug us at all so that was nice too. I will go back to this place with my co-workers for sure. Keep your eyes peeled for little birds in the joint too...somehow they got in. No idea what that does to the health code, but I'm not bothered by it.",2

Everyone at Trump was extremely friendly and accomodating.  From the moment we pulled up, until it was time for check-out we were greeted with professional, smiling staff.  The room was clean and comfortable.

We had birthday cookies and a pitcher of cold milk sent to our room for our daughter and they were big, warm, and DELICIOUS!

The bed was so comfortable I layed down and was instantly asleep.  I think that's the first time I've slept without tossing and turning in years!

They will talk things out with you and not play around or take their time for useless things.

I'm never coming here again and I'll explain why. So last Thursday I came for dinner at 6:30 because I was going to watch Star Wars at the theater next door at 7:30. This place had good reviews so I stopped in and it was beautiful! The decor was nice and authentic the staff was friendly and the chefs even said hello. We were seated in a booth and ordered the teriyaki chicken and beef teriyaki. The presentation was beautiful I mean down to the placement. Our entrees came with a green salad and a soup. The salad dressing was amazing but they drenched my salad in it! Literally I finished all my salad and still had a large amount of dressing leftover in the bowl. The miso soup had great flavor but it had a weird little after taste to it. Now let's talk about what made me sick. My chicken teriyaki was THE MOST bland, cold, rubbery, tasted reheated, piece of chicken I have ever eaten. It had grill marks on it but I could tell it was NOT fresh. Imagine a piece of chicken that you grilled then kept in the fridge for a day then microwaved in a few days and left out for a bit. That's what this tasted like. I wish I was making this up. It didn't have any flavor no salt no seasoning absolutely nothing. I drenched it in teriyaki sauce to eat it. While I ate it I felt forced to take bites just to get something in my stomach but I stopped after a while. Why did I eat it and not send it back? 1. It was my first meal of the day and I was starving. 2. I was in a time crunch and didn't want to send it back because it would make me late for the movie. 3. I needed to eat in order to survive a 3 hr movie and didn't want to get food at the theater. I had someone else taste my chicken and they said it was the worst piece of chicken they ever had. Later that night at the movies I started to feel sick. When I got home I felt worse. I don't want to share what kind of sick I got because it's TMI but you can imagine. This place ruined chicken so bad for me I don't think I can ever eat another chicken teriyaki plate without gagging. Also the other person I was with said their beef was cold and tasteless while they were eating it. I don't know what went wrong, maybe they were in a hurry and didn't feel the need to make a fresh piece of chicken but that's something I would expect at McDonald's and not a restaurant like this.",2

Mind you the other flavours had my heart as well 

Once ripped open you can actually feel the buttery pastry which ends up melting in your mouth. The outer layer complimented it perfectly crispy and flakey,  especially the ends of the croissant which I personally left to the end to eat.

I began filling up the cups with ice, but the ice maker kept on going and going.  There were 3 employees taking a break, so I mentioned it to them and then to those behind the counter.  It took several minutes for someone to turn off the machine, but by that time the ice had started to melt and fall on the floor.  A young employee came over to clean up the mess, but didn't really know what to do.  A couple of the older employees came over to tell him what to do, but didn't help him at all.  The counter ended up getting wiped, but the wet and slippery floor wasn't.  My friend actually warned a customer about the slippery floor.  In the mean time, an older woman told the staff that most of the tables were dirty and we could see that the floor had not been swept.  That woman also told the same young employee that he should be cleaning the dining area. He just looked at her and said ""I have no common sense"" and walked away like it was a joke. He came back with a rag for the dirty tables, but we decided to leave after that.  There were so many staff members ""working"" but no one seemed to care how the dining area looked or that the floor was wet and slippery.",1

Took my significant other here for her birthday, and we were both very pleased. Smoked sampler was out of this world. She is a very picky eater, and she raved about their salmon dish. I tried the rainbow trout, which was presented in an interesting fashion (head, skin, and tail included), but tasted fantastic. On that note, I would say I have a bone to pick, literally, as I found several in my fish. Our service was excellent and very quick, and to top things off, when our waitress learned it was my girlfriend's birthday, dessert was on the house! It was a wonderful experience. One of my favorite seafood places I've ever been to, and I LOVE my seafood.

I understand what many said about poor lighting, but I would put my two cents in to say, it's not unusually dark... It was certainly dim, but for a dining room with not a lot of privacy and plenty of candles, I thought it was quite enjoyable...

Seeing as I want a blend of a natural birth in a hospital setting, this office and hospital weren't for me. While I expect the chances of my OB to be the one to actually deliver my baby to be unpredictable, Dr Boots told me it was about 50/50 that she would deliver. And while she said that she and the hospital is open-minded, she acted like neither have done many natural unmedicated birth's and didn't seem overly interested in guiding the natural birth hospital blend I was looking for. She was pleasant enough but nothing to stand out.

So I finally gave up, went and parked, and went inside. As we walked in, the girl at the register still wasn't paying attention until we were directly standing in front of her. I asked a couple simple questions about a couple items on the menu and the girl was very short and in my opinion flat out rude with us.

My husband and kids sat down at an available table while I waited my turn to order.  When it was my turn to order, the cashier told me that my family needed to get up from the table.  I could hardly believe what I was hearing.  I asked to verify, ""you want my family to get up from the table?""

To see this place grow into the busy bee it has, I am so thankful that I got to experience it from the beginning when they first opened. I wish they had recycling for their cups as it makes me sad that all that plastic does not even get recycled, but theres nothing I can really do about that.

Then had the nerve to mock us directly, and hassle our table some more. We were rushed, our food AND drinks were wrong, and were told verbatim ""I have a table of seven, so you need to order NOW if you want any food."" She scoffed any time we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled, and trust me, she never came back to our table so we HAD to ask.

The double order drive-thrus are meant to take two orders at one time, but they only seem to go back and forth between the two sides and it creates a bottleneck. I've never had a problem with the food being cold or in my orders being incorrect though. I've only been inside once. They do have the new self order kiosks, which are pretty cool.

The services is impeccable from the bus boys to the managers, everyone is so accommodating, it really makes for a comfortable environment. I've also had their stuffed lobster, which I'm not really a huge fan of, I've tasted better elsewhere, and the lobsters weren't impressive in size.

However, a week ago, we decided to order take out again and unfortunately, our experience wasn't even close to what it was the first time. Once we got home with our food, we realized that they had forgotten to give us our Greek Fries. I called them and spoke with a girl who asked me in an accusatory tone, ""Did you pay for them?"" - I found this ridiculous, as why would I call about my missing fries if I didn't pay for them? (This was after I spent $40 dollars on dinner.. .not likely I would lie about having paid for a $4 order of fries.) After pressing the issue some more, she agreed to have the missing fries delivered. We live a 5 minute drive away, and it took them almost an hour to get the fries to us. The lady I spoke to on the phone was rude and condescending when I called back to ask them where they were. She blamed me for giving her the wrong address (which is completely untrue, seeing as how I live at the address so I know what it is and she spewed off something that sounded completely different; it was more likely a result of her not paying attention), then she argued with me about what ""east of Coxwell"" means.  After a good 45 minutes of waiting, I called back again to ask her where the driver was, and to ask her how it could possibly take so long, and she interrupted and yelled at me and told me to let her talk and then lied and said the driver had a flat tire. Ummm... such a huge lie, as she named an address that is just down the street from my house and I went to take a look and there was no car there with a flat tire. 

Besides the horrible service, the meat was very dry this time around. Even if the food improves, I would never go back here again. There are so many other Greek spots on the Danforth, why would I subject myself to this kind of service?",2

My mom has been here on several occasions and has raved about it so we figured why not. Our stomachs had control at this point and honestly, soup on a cold day sounded very appealing. 

And it's not often you see both owners walking around the place asking you how everything is and if you could use anything. Really nice people who worked there.

Our waitress was killer awesome. She took our order by memory and we both ordered the corn beef hash that came with a bread roll, salad and two eggs for $7. Cool. 

When the food came out my eyes got as big as my stomach felt empty. The portions were HUGE! My sister and I could've definitely split one. The bread was made by hand I'm 99% sure and was delightful. I ended up with a salad (which was also huge for a side salad...nothing fancy but fresh and homemade dressing) whereas the sis subbed in some clam chowder soup and insisted I try it. I don't like clams...well...not of that particular nature anyway. ;) It was really delicious and had great flavor and consistency. Not watered down or anything that would remotely resemble an instant soup.

My sister and I easily ended up getting containers for our food as there was no way we could eat it all. On the way out, I couldn't help but admire the cheesecake that called my name before me. It was their chocolate one (cannot remember the name of it as I was so mesmerized) and looked super rich but divine. I had to have it. So I got two. No, that wasn't my inner fat-kid talking...I bought one for my parents to split ya weirdos. The lady at the counter was super nice and boxed up the slices in a safe-transport container...which my car appreciated.

This is a buffet Japanese seafood style. Plenty selection of sushi, sashimi, seafood salad etc. Selection extends to hot food and some non-seafood and hot food. They have miso soup and Udon. All self serve.  Good election of desert, and they even have Chocolate Fountain!!!! 
Quality is decent. And for the price you pay for seafood buffet, I'd say this place beats those pricey ones inside casinos. $22 for dinner will get you a large variety, satisfy your cravings and get full.

So then my sticks him out in their unseasoned and pretty flat and tasteless, so he has the manager come over and she replaces that steak, and I tell her about the whiny but waiter and the clueless hostess and also point out that the baked potato came out cold. It wouldn't even melt the butter. So she puts out those fires and apologizes, but I asked her to please train  The staff, as there is no excuse for sending out a cold big potato, or unseasoned steak, or whining about conditions waiters. You know, I was sitting there, and looking on yelp at other local restaurants that are their competitors and in the same parking lot just next to them is a steakhouse called Logan's with a lot better reviews. You know want to businesses firing their busboys that doesn't say it's a healthy thriving business, and there are reasons why. When the manager is only a 20 something manager you already know they're cutting corners on paychecks and you're really not gonna have somebody who really manages the business.",2

They were unable to refer me to any alterations places due to how new they were when I purchased.  So I called Barb, and she booked me for her home studio to go over what alterations I needed.  In the meantime, my matron of honor had ordered her dress from Alfred Angelo.  Oh boy, was that a disaster (which I covered in another review) - and they over sized her for her gown, and completely botched her alterations.  During one of my trials, I mentioned my concerns to Barb and she suggested that since I would be bringing my MOH into her studio to learn how to put my bustle together (since it was fairly involved with several layers) she suggested that I bring the MOH dress with us and she would eyeball it and make sure that it would make it through the day (my concern, since I saw the seams and was skeptical) in one piece.  She did an AMAZING job on my dress.  It was a corset, strapless that didn't move once in the full day and night I wore it.  Impressive since I insisted we visit Blush Nightclub for lap dances after the wedding!  My dress did not BUDGE.  In the meantime, she corrected a seam in the breast area that had my MOH looking like Madonna in that cone bra getup from that one tour from the late 80's early 90's.  She also replaced the cups and cleaned up the MOH dress, and didn't even charge a single solitary dime.  If you have to buy your bridesmaids their dresses at places like David's or Alfred, at least take them to Barb to do your alterations.  She charges much less, and does a much better job.

23283,3,1550188800000,"I've read ALL the previous reviews before my first visit last night. My partner and I decided to splurge for our anniversary. I agree with the majority of reviews. I have to say that although the overall expense was an order of magnitude higher than an average meal, this was not an average meal! I justified it like other costs when you go to Las Vegas - a dinner show, night club with limosine, or other wild adventures that you can only venture in Las Vegas.

For me it is a similar expense, since I have four kids and it always can end up pricey. For those on a budget, it is still doable. But since it it's easier to judge for yourself two of us each opted for the four course dinner. Some of the items you select from the detailed menu to fill in the menu have additional charge. We had no drinks except after dinner coffee and tea. Bottom line: $800 including tip.  So, if you are looking at value, maybe the 16 course meal is better priced.  Our four course meal was way too much food, though, so I have to guess that 16 courses would have put me in a coma.  You make your own decision. BTW, all the staff were friendly, not stuffy.  Of course I'm a happy guy so maybe they were just reacting to my smile.

My mother called me the next morning to tell me how sick she had gotten and I informed her that I too became violently ill.  It had to have been the fish fry.  That was the only thing that we both ate that was the same. I don't know if it wasn't cleaned well or was just bad fish in general. My mother ended up calling the manager of the restaurant and speaking with him (Saturday morning).  And appearently he wasn't very apologetic and did not offer to rectify the situation in any way. My mom gave him my phone number also to call me....and I never received a call from him.  I'd also like to add that I had my 19 month old daughter with us and am SO glad that I did not give her any of this fish....Not to mention I was 25 weeks pregnant with twins at the time and throwing up with diarrhea is not something any pregnant woman wants to go thru because of a bad meal.

Chopped Ahi Tuna Appetizer - piled in the middle with a ring, surrounded by some crispy chips, its a nice appetizer to try. Tuna was fresh and tender. No chewy bits. Chips were nice and crispy. Great to eat the tuna on top of the chip. 

Salmon Tacos - Two soft tortilla tacos with sour cream, guacamole, and a sauce (tomatillo? green tomato?) on the side. Salmon was a bit dry, more on the cooked side. My preference on cooking salmon at home, would a crisp sear on the outside, and the inside is still borderline raw. Keeps it nice and tender and moist. Overall, the taco was delicious. Will try a different fish next time ! 

Orange Roughy Fish Plate - BEST of the 3. ok a little side story. prior to this, my friend and I had seen Orange Roughy at a restaurant we ate at before. Didn't know what it was but had google'd it up and what not. Since then, we've been seeing it everywhere. Finally got to try it. Had ordered the fish plate with a side of sweet potato fries, comes with a cole slaw, and we were given two different sauces (indecisive and the one who took our order said she'll give us both to try). The sauces were a mango salsa and a garlic butter. The fish was nicely grilled. The texture of the fish was tender but not flaky like salmon. its more... stringy? iunoe how to describe that. medium texture, not soft like bass but not firm like salmon or tuna when fully cooked. The garlic butter is, like garlic butter. Very butter, with a hint, not too strong garlic flavor. The mango salsa, OMG you can give me a bowl of that, i can eat straight up or with chips or something. So bright and refreshing. Paired on top of the fish. SUPER WIN ! Squirt some lemon juice on top, and take a bite. its like a symphony of flavors. 

Will come back to try other fishes as well. Been recommended the fried cod tacos. Next time ! :D",2

We've only ever tried two things at this place, the oatmeal cream pie and the tsoynamis.  

The oatmeal cookie parts of the cream pie were great, but the filling was way, way, too sweet.  Actually overpowers the flavor of the oatmeal cookies.

Gotta just compare the tsoynami to other ice cream joints even though it's not technically ice cream.  It tastes fine.  A little icy (understandable with no dairy), but the hint of coconut along with the crunch of the mix-ins makes for a decent dessert on a hot day.  I would never call this a bad thing, but it just can't compare to real ice cream in taste and texture.

We were novices and got too filled up on the great signature rolls that they offered.  Get the NIGIRI first, then fill up on the rest of the other items that take previous stomach space.  ;-)!  Also, dessert was limited to one as well so you need to some allocation analysis to fit all you want to try in this meal.  The only reason why they lost a star is that we were kept waiting nearly 15 minutes in between our meal before our nigiri sushi came out.  They had a large party before us but there were four sushi chefs working so I think they lost our order.  Our waiter came back twice and didn't see our food on the table so he went back and forth to see what was the delay.  It took the hostess to check on our food before we got something on our table.  It was very strange but I guess we had an extra 15 minutes to digest our food so we could fit MORE!!

38286,3,1550275200000,"BEWARE STAY AWAY FROM MOORE CHRYSLER JEEP!!  WORST SERVICE IN AZ!!!  Absolutely the worst service ever!  Our sales rep was Bryan and we felt rushed the whole time possibly due to the holidays (Christmas)  At first he was pleasant but as time past he became very unprofessional.  The first time I was there we were negotiating a deal, however, I had to leave and it was close to closing time.  So he asked me are you coming back and I said I wasn't sure.  So he said well if you come back this evening than I have to stay here till you come back.  So then I felt bad and decided to come back the following day.  The following day we negotiated a deal for a Jeep Summit V8.  I had wanted one in white not black so he told me I would have to pick it up the following day because the owners wife was driving it and they had to get it from her and clean it.  So we go the next day (christmas eve) he was trying to rush through everything because he had to drive to las vegas.  As he was working with us he was also working with another couple.  The other couple couldn't come to a deal so when he would come back to finish up with us he was talking badly about the other customers to us.  I felt that was really rude!!  When the vehicle we purchased was cleaned, they brought it to us and we did a walk through which we found scratches.  Before I was about to leave off the property, my husband wanted to open up the hood.  When he opened up the hood, he noticed it was a V6.  By then I was just so frustrated, I didn't care anymore.  We did find some scratches on the new vehicle probably since it was being driven by the owners family.   They said they would replaced what needed to be replaced however it had to be ordered which can take up to a week.  I had also ordered a block heater for the vehicle since we were moving to the midwest.  So he apparently ordered the door panel that had to be replaced and the block heater.  
Two weeks later I get a phone call from Bryan telling me to bring the vehicle in since the parts arrived.  He told me to bring it in around 11am the next day.  I arrive at 11am and no one attended to me.  I stand around asking for help but they kept saying someone will be with you soon.  Around 45 minutes later, I am furious and demand for help.  Finally, we get help and I was told it was impossible to get the door panel on with out an appointment.  I find out that I never had an appointment....So frustrating!!!!  So we make another appointment for the following week since we had to reorder the block heater because that was never ordered just the door panel was ordered.  We take it back the following week at OUR appointment time which went very smooth surprisingly.  Fooled myself to soon...we picked up our vehicle when it was completed and I noticed it wasn't washed.  I've own quite a few vehicles and every time I took them to get maintenance they were washed.  I have a lexus and Lexus Arrowhead dealership blows Moore Chrysler Jeep away with customer service.  I love my jeep but I'm afraid I will never buy another jeep again from my experience.

44154,3,1550966400000,"I am updating this review not as a reflection on Dr. Washinsky's expertise and professionalism, but rather that of his staff. I had an appointment recently and was given a battery of tests. Though I'm on Medicare and have a ""Medicare Advantage"" plan, I asked how much they would cost me. I was told they were ""covered"" and would cost little or nothing by a staffer. Needless to say I was surprised when I received a bill for $700, my ""deductible"" for ""Out of Network."" Well, I knew he was ""Out of Network,"" but I absolutely asked that question and received the above response.

The reason I called was to make an appointment to get some prescriptions refilled and obviously I couldn't unless the bill was paid. I immediately sought another physician with good qualifications and ""In Network."" I found one who's, perhaps, not as good, though I can't really form an opinion at this point. However, I can say that when I made the appointment, the staff was forthcoming, checked my insurance and told me exactly what my co-pay would be. The physician was just fine and refilled my scripts.

I wrote a letter to Washinsky a couple of days ago, thanking him for his fine service over the past dozen years and explaining why I was making a change. This update could, of course, change if he responds with a ""mea culpa."" However, he has a very large practice and my visceral feeling is that losing a single patient, no matter how long term and how many referrals I've provided, it simply won't make a difference.

For me this is a true loss of a fine professional. You might think it could be ""overlooked,"" however, if the staff can make a simple mistake on coverage, it can also make others.

If there is a response that make a difference, well, I'll keep you posted.",2

The food was good and they have One of my favorite vodkas that Nobody else has in Arizona. The male bartender last night was a total tool and a complete ahole... I showed up at 6 and the show didn't start until 8 so I was there early because it was on my way home from work and decided to avoid traffic. I was eating and drinking and I around 7/7:30 people started to cash out at the bar and get up and leave they started to take the stools, but nobody asked me to move... When more people started coming up to the bar to order drinks I still just sat in my seat enjoying my beverage and even got another one. I was sitting at the end of the bar closer to the patio. Shortly after I heard the mail bartender say ""I can't believe we have a line because of one f*cking seat."" I wasn't so much surprised to hear him cursing because he dropped the F bomb and curse-words behind the bar more that he spoke regular words but I just assumed that's the type of establishment that is except none of the other employees did. I've run a bar before and I've been a bartender and if they didn't want people sitting at the bar after a certain time so that they could serve the numerous amounts of people walking up to get drinks they could have just asked and I gladly would have moved outside which I did after the bartender decided to be a complete and total asshole. I still left a 20% tip I'm not going to threaten that I'm not coming back or I'm gonna tell my friends to not go there because anybody in the industry knows that's just a dumb thing to say and the other staff members were just great and it's a really cool establishment and I'm glad I got to experience it but that mail bartender the one who's getting ready to leave for Denver apparently is a piece of sh*t.

The tables are so small that when the meal comes, you have to do a lot of juggling around to make room for the rest of the stuff that you already have on the tables.  A few more inches would have been a much better design plus the chairs are very uncomfortable.  The place has no soundproofing and is very, very loud.  It reminded us of a cafeteria much like a school.  We kept thinking we were in a factory--not a pleasant atmosphere at all.  We feel it is disgusting that whoever designed this place all they had in mind was how many people we can fit no matter how uncomfortable they may be.

I decided to go with the shrimp and pork wonton soup - which is actually soup as opposed to the other ""soup"" options which specify ""steamed"".  And also ordered the hot spicy wonton noodles under the ""dry noodles"" section of the menu.  

On retrospect I should have ordered one or the other because it was wonton overload and generally food overload, I barely made a dent in either and had plenty to take home.  That being said, I enjoyed the soup and was able to eat about 2 of the wontons.  I was imagining a small bowl of soup but this could dish feed a family of 4 or more!

I wasn't in to the hot wonton noodle dish.  I got the wide flat noodles (as opposed to the thin rice noodles) so not sure if that made a huge difference because it was the flavor that didn't make me swoon.  You can definitely physically feel the heat of the dish but I didn't think there was much flavor.  I was sweating and my mouth was reacting to the spice but it was spicy hot as opposed to spicy flavorful.  Perhaps the name of the dish makes sense then.

On the third time, I was on my way to an appointment with a client and my card had just been on vacation, so it was pretty dirty on the inside. Like an idiot... I let them pressure me into the $32.95 upgrade this time. The outside of the car was just average and the inside of the car was absolutely terrible. It looks like all they did was barely vacuum the mats. Console, dash, everything looked untouched. I didn't have time to have it fixed, so just lived with it. Here's the sad part... I was the only car there and they had about 5 guys all working on it... so I expected it would turn out great.

I didn't want to give them a negative review, so I emailed the company to tell them of my experience. Their response was to have the manager of the location call me and offer to re-do the wash. That would have been great if there wasn't all kinds of attitude behind the offer. I will keep driving the extra few minutes to get treated more fairly.

I can't say more about how wonderful our experience was with the taste and quality of the food, as well as the superior service. We look forward ordering catering from them for our next party.",2

Second star, for the welcoming staff. The front desk was warm and friendly. As you walk in, you are immediately immersed in the vibe. The bartenders smile at you, everything about this place is inviting. It's nice when everyone is welcoming and not just the one person seating you, or serving you. Makes a HUGE difference. 
Third star for the FOOD,  dishes nothing short of tastebud nirvana. We had the lobster rolls, which were a mixture of lobster nestled inside of a miniature sweet potato roll.  Ahhhhhmazing. We had the scallops, and okay my husband doesn't even eat scallops and LOVED them. I had the Mediterranean salad, beautiful presentation and simply perfect. We had the short rib Mac & cheese, a little too heavy for us, but delicious nevertheless. We also had shrimp cocktail, nothing much about shrimp cocktail as you know, however their cocktail sauce was delicious. 
FOURTH AND FIFTH star for David H, our server. Who was not only knowledgeable about the menu, but extremely helpful and patient while we decided what to pick of all the fantastic choices. Obviously 2 people can only eat so much food, so we wanted to choose 5 items to share. He was extremely helpful and pleasant.  There is nothing greater than experiencing fine food, in a luxurious atmosphere with an amazing server. So thank you David H. for providing us with an amazing experience. We will be back!",1

One son ordered pad thai and its was bland and nothing special the other son had the Vig burger and fries and ate the whole thing and rated it a 7 in his opinion....my husband had a burger he said it was delicious and gave it an 8.  I had the chicken sandwich and it was OK don't think I would order again - I would describe it as dry - needed some sauce on both buns. I also ordered the brussels sprouts and they were wet/mushy.  

Overall great vibe!  The staff was friendly!  There was plenty of parking and even a valet service. 

Outside dining area is large with lots of cozy sofas and a big grassy area (several children running around/screaming - seemed a bit odd ).  Lots of heating lamps and misters...A+ for this!!",2
