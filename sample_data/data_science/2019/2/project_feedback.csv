9,2,1549324800000,"DROOL. 

Every time I want Middle Eastern food (and I am today but Seattle sucks for such thing thus far)....I think of Haji Baba. Introduced to me as one of the first restaurants I ate at when I was a freshman at ASU (wow that was 6 years ago-- I'm old). 

What I miss most is the chicken shawarma plate that I would order with salad instead of tabooli and hummus (no offense to tabooli-- it's great here but I'm not a fan). Their hummus is good because it is made with the right ingredients and it's simple. Hummus should be kept simple.  The shawarma garlic sauce with the sririacha-- is a true delight.  

What else is good: EVERYTHING! Falafel, gyro, shawarama salad, all their appetizers. Their lemonade is homemade and not too sweet. It has a weird flavor that gives it a "" what is this?"" appeal. Also in AZ when it's hot, drinks = must because the water sucks. 

Don't  forget to get a baklava. They have like 6 or 7 diff varieties and they are all delicious. You can also check out their small market which is a part of the restaurant and has a wide variety of middle eastern random goods and spices. 

Big portions (I always had lots of leftovers), cheap food and a simple approach. I MISS YOU HAJI BABA and I promise I will go back to you every time I visit.",2
23,3,1550793600000,"Ok, I haven't gone there in person yet, but their website alone gets 5 stars! I noticed something odd, though and I hope someone will indulge me. 

I started comparing the photos of the restored house with how the house looked in the movie. They did an amazing job, by the way. I was paying particular attention to the shed in the backyard.  Call me crazy, but it's not the same shed! I found that strange since they supposedly filmed those yard scenes on location, in the actual yard. 

1) In the movie, there is no door in the front (just some tools leaning against it), but the ""real"" shed has a door (and it looks just as old as the rest of the shed, not added later). 

2) In the movie, the small window in the front of the shed is way over to the left side, right against the corner of the shed. But in ""reality"" its closer to where the door is. 

3) Lastly, the ""real"" shed as a second window, on the right end of the shed. But in the movie there is no window there. What gives?  

I'm really not a Christmas Story ""freak"" (honest!) I'm just a little too observant I guess. :)",3
26,2,1550534400000,"I got the Gotham pizza to go. It costs $32 (comped).  When I picked up a slice, the ingredients started dripping off the pizza because the crust is paper thin.  So thin that my pizza was pointing downwards as I tried to eat it.  I had to use a fork to pick up my food.  Overall the pizza is very greasy and not as tasty as Papa John's for triple the price.

Next time, I will just use my comps on that new burger joint next to the poker room.",2
31,2,1550275200000,"First time here, ordered the Mushroom bisque and crab avocado melt.  The soup was so delicious, it wasn't that hot but warm enough.  The sandwich was great as well!  Great customer service and the chocolate dipped strawberry they include in your meal was a perfect little treat!  The fall specials look yummy so I plan to go back soon!",2
33,2,1550793600000,"I moved to Charlotte about 5 months ago and like many women, dreaded finding a new hairstylist, nail salon and eyebrow guru! I was used to paying $30 + plus tip but I didn't care; I take a lot of pride in my thick brows! 

In my search, I saw EWC. I visited EWC in my hometown as recommended by my best friend, but just wasn't impressed. However, Casey's name kept popping up and I thought I would give her a try. I am so glad I did because she IS amazing! I've now trusted her with my brows 4-5 times and each time walked out extremely happy. 

I was so happy after my first appointment but didn't want to rush to write a review. There are so many times I've had a good service but go back and it's just not the same. Casey knows what she is doing, but most importantly, her work is consistent.

I am so relieved to have found Casey! I will most likely be moving out of the Ballantyne area in the next few months, but I will continue to come back to her for my brows!",3

37,3,1549756800000,"Poor customer service after the sale.  Bought a used vehicle from them and I knew id didn't have a warranty.  The speakers were blown which I didn't check because I trusted their inspection that showed everything was in working order.  At first they said they'd replace it for free and then they said I'd have to pay $100 toward the costs.  Now they are saying they won't do anything the remedy the problem.  They are not good for their word - make sure you get it in writing or they'll just try to accommodate you with words only not to follow through.  I just wish they were honest instead of making false promises to ""make things right"".",2
49,1,1549238400000,"If you want to feel like a spoiled princess, tell your man to take you here! Everything about this café is cute. The decorations, the teddy bears, the furniture, the pinkness of the whole place, and even the desserts. It actually feels kind of surreal. The best seats are the couches, it's comfy and cozy - great for cuddling ;)

The stairs to the café is located in the front and back of the plaza right on Yonge & Finch (same plaza as Crazy Wings). There is paid parking in the back, but because we always come here after 9pm, it's free parking in the front (on the streets). So don't waste that $3!  

Their menu is quite extensive in my opinion, at least extensive enough. The waffles were beautifully presented and really delicious! The princess waffle comes with fruits and a choice of 2 flavours of ice cream - green tea, strawberry, cookies & cream, chocolate, and vanilla. I love green tea ice cream, but I decided to go with strawberry and cookies & cream. Both were really good. The mixture of warm waffles and cold ice cream went really well together. None were overly sweet. My favourite hot drink from Café Princess would be the Sweet Potato Latte. As for cold drink, I love their Iced Green Tea Latte. Creamy and flavourful, sweet but not too sweet.

The best thing about this café is that they have board games for you in case it starts getting boring. Unfortunately, the board games are very limited and some have missing pieces. On top of that, each board game you bring back to your table, you will be charged $2.50. So I suggest you either think hard before choosing which game you really want to play or bring your own games (no charge).",2

We were on vacation in Toronto, renting a condo in the building where this Pizza Pizza is located, so it made an easy dinner in, after spending the day site-seeing.   The food was good.

92,2,1549238400000,Called to get a delivery and the girl who answered the phone tonight just was the rudest employee I have ever talked too! Not only did I ask to speak to the manager 5 times she actually denied me to be able to speak to her manager! She sounded so ghetto it was ridiculous they had her even answering the phones. I ask a question and not only did she give me an answer very rudely she yelled out the question for her coworkers to answer with them yelling back through the phone at me the answer! My friends and I have decided to pass over Nunzios as our weekly girls night in spot. NO THANKS we would much rather give our business to an appreciative company who appreciates there customers. Nunzios on Lorain is trash as well as there disgustingly ghetto employee.,1
100,2,1550880000000,A short walk and very cool to see. Nothing fancy but it is very neat to watch thousands of bats flying all around you. We were a bit late (the sun had already set) so we missed the big exit from the cave but this is definitely worth checking out.,2
103,3,1550707200000,I came here for breakfast today and had forgot my contact lenses. They were so nice that they actually told me what was available because I couldn't read the menu. The food was great! The service was awesome!!!,1
104,1,1550016000000,I went here with my friend and the restaurant itself it pretty nice. The upstairs patio is really cool. We got there during happy hour so our beer was only like two dollars when its originally $8 which was nice. I got the chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries to eat. The chicken sandwich was fried in a beer batter and it was so greasy the breading was falling off it wasn't that great and the bacon on it wasn't seasoned or anything it was just average. The sweet potato fries were strange it was like they made them out of the skins of the potato they were really thin. My friend got the grilled cheese sandwich with pot roast and she said it was really garlicky and the seasoning didn't go with the food. I probably wouldn't eat here again I would come back for happy hour though.,3
105,1,1550793600000,"I had just arrived in Toronto and stayed at the Hazleton I found this place just in front of the hotel It looked very busy.

136,3,1548979200000,"This place is horrible. We had two rooms and both of them had stopped up sinks. They came up to ""fix"" the problem but when they left it was worse! We stayed at this hotel during Memorial Day weekend and parking was horrible. We drove around the city for awhile and when we returned around 2:00am the parking garage was full and they said the spots left are for V.I.P only so we were forced to park a block way at Bally's :/ This happened 2 out of the 4 nights we were there. The rooms are dingy and very old. I will NEVER stay here again and if you want to have a great experience in Vegas you wouldn't stay here either.",2

Recommendation: Yes! Look here! A brand new, sparkling, pretty hotel.

Tip: The smoking balcony is a great place to hang out outside, as long as there aren't too many smokers out there. When we were out there sharing the space with smokers, we thankfully couldn't smell anything!

Review: Wow, a nice place to stay! Covered parking, multiple elevators, helpful staff, beautiful and trendy decorations and architecture, a well done continental breakfast, multiple pillow choices, multiple chairs in the room, USB charging ports everywhere.... The list just keeps going on and on! Having opened partway through July 2016, this hotel is brand new and has all the amenities and architecture to show it. I'd definitely look at prices here first if I plan on returning to Pittsburgh anytime soon. 

Only a few things I didn't like. One, the lobby wasn't on the entrance floor; you have to go up an elevator or stairway to find the lobby and welcome desk, which can be a bit confusing for tired or rushed people. 

Also, in our room the bathroom door was  a sliding door with a big pane of frosted glass. It lets light, smells, sounds, and steam through, which is not ideal for a bathroom. Couple that with the lack of a fan in the bathroom and I would say I've seen better bathroom designs. However, the sink had pull-out drawers, plenty of counter space, and was brightly lit, so that's pretty much the only gripe I have with the room itself.",2

I like how you can set how spicy you want your soup too because a lot of the other noodle houses here in Chinatown don't make their bowls spicy enough. It's also relatively new so there's no wait!",2

171,1,1550361600000,"This brewery is decent. The star rating indicates that. Yet again on our trip to Arizona we wanted to try a good brew pub after our visit to the ASU campus. We came across this place by Sun Devil Stadium and thought it looked fun. We then walked a few minutes after it opened and we were welcomed and took a seat. I decided to stray from my usual chicken tenders and got a brat instead. Luckily, we got a daily deal on that. There are TVs, they show the games. The best thing about this place by far is the view of the stadium. I have never been here on a game day but it would be really exciting before the game and hearing the roar of the crowd. Anyway, back to the food. I got my brat and I looked at it. It was very cold with no sauce. it still was good for what it was worth. The fries were good too. I was stunned to find they have no milk! What place wouldn't have milk?! Oh well. Still decent food with a view which is good. They did good overall, just make some minor changes and this place would be even cooler.",2
172,2,1550707200000,"Competent dentists and technicians, but disturbing dishonesty and bill padding. I had two small fillings required. They wanted me to pay over $1,000 after insurance for custom made Cerec inserts. I asked them why, and they told me that they refuse to do amalgam because of the mercury content, and that best practices today are to not use amalgam, which I could confirm at the ADA web site. Well, I refused the treatment and went home and looked it up, and here is what I found on the ADA web site: ""Dental amalgam is considered a safe, affordable and durable material that has been used to restore the teeth of more than 100 million Americans""...""Dental amalgam has been studied and reviewed extensively, and has established a record of safety and effectiveness"".

196,3,1550534400000,"First of all, if you struggle to find this place you're not alone. The address is 303 Centre St SE, but you'll find it inside a bigger building on 3 Ave SW right near the Centre St intersection. Follow the sandwich board arrows inside! The restaurant is the first on your right once you're inside.

The place is open from 11am - 8pm, with a specials list all under $10 on weekdays 2-6pm and Saturdays 11am - 6pm. I walked into an empty (tiny) restaurant at 5:30pm and asked for a spicy recommendation from their specials list. She suggested the Kongpao Chicken Combo, which is very popular. It was $8.75 + tax - I peeked and the usual menu item is $13.50.

My food was ready is less than 5 minutes and was pretty tasty! I had a generous serving of rice with chicken, onion, peppers and chilies. I was impressed with the chicken quality and the flavour given the price. Plus the veggies tasted fresh even though I don't see how they could have cooked it so quickly.

For dining in it's not much to see, just eight cheap wooden tables each with four chairs and their usual menu is all around the $15 mark. I'm not sure I'd ever dine in but I certainly see myself working my way through the specials list on future takeaway nights in.",2
199,1,1549065600000,"Pleasantly surprising.  They serve Royal (@ the Market), for those interested.

Being pretty hip to the coffee scene in PHX, I was a little surprised to hear of this new shop, having not heard of it's coming.  Maybe I didn't look around enough, but it felt like Nami just kind of popped up.

So I had my doubts, as I always will when giving a new place a shot.  The layout was pleasant, and the decor pretty rad; love the couch.  Parking seems sorted out a great deal better than when That's A Wrap inhabited the area -  good plus there.  Sweets looked great.

So I order my typical - drip and a 2x (on the side).  This gives me a general idea of the shop; milk drinks are for second and beyond trips.  Firstly, their demi-tasses are super cute.  Obviously hand-made, and hopefully local.  Loved it.  My drip actually turned out to be a pour-over, which is a plus to me.  A coffee junkie can appreciate a pour-over, where it kind of scares a person just wanting some ""coffee"" (see: I understand why you call it drip vs pour-over).

Straight up espresso is generally a quick way of determining bad-average-good.  Crema was nice though, consistent, and had me thinking I might have a decent thing here.  Taste was good, creamy and quite chocolatey (which seems the profile of the beans being used - the drip was reminiscent of the same).  Said and done (from a 'snob' standpoint), the espresso was good, not mindblowing.  I think the grind was right, but either the dosing could be moved up a tiny bit, or tamped a little harder.  Granted, this was the first and only I had there, so I can't necessarily base the entire shop on that one dopio.  All in all, I'm saying it was good, and while the extraction time was right, it could use a little more density.

The drip (see: pour-over) clearly used the same roast, which isn't a complaint.  The same chocolatey, creamy notes were abound.  I feel the dosing was very light, and should have either been a 12oz, or more grounds used.  I actually felt I was drinking a water heavy coffee.  Not terrible, but certainly not great.  I have a sneaking suspicion if the measurement was a bit closer, it would have been a much better brew.  Pour-overs are an art first, for sure, then a science.  I think they have potential here.  Maybe a better pot would help with this brew method as well.


-- I'll be back.  My experience was neither mind-blowing nor off-putting.  I'm hoping after they get into the swing of things and get the kinks ironed out, this will be one of the cooler stops in PHX.  Certainly a great concept and whatnot.",3
202,3,1550102400000,I have been going here on and off since it has opened its doors. The owner is so nice and she even opened up a clothing boutique next door to the tanning shop. Very cute stuff. The pricing is very reasonable and they always have coupons out.,2
210,2,1551052800000,"Nothing fancy but it sure is good. The first thing that you'll notice when walking in is that you order fries, hoagies, and salads at the farthest counter and everything else at long counter closest to the door.  The burgers with everything on top (including egg) are good. But of course they are famous for the mountain of fries with the big package of ketchup they come along with. They are greasy and fattening and that's why I love them so much. Other stuff, like the steak hoagies and, of course, hot dogs are good too. I think the hot dogs have a natural casing on them, so they firm exterior that you have to bite through, which some people don't really like that much.

Still one of my favorites is the salad but of course at a place like this it's no ordinary healthy green salad. You can get it with chicken or steak on top. With a bunch of other good stuff on top; cheese, boiled egg, hot pepper, tomatoes, green peppers, etc. But the best part is a great big mound of french fries that they put on top. It's so good!! I know putting french fries on everything isn't for everyone, but on the bright side you can tell all your friends you had salad for lunch and not be a liar.

The staff can be kind of meh sometimes but usually don't mind making small talk. As a woman, I probably wouldn't walk in here after 11pm alone but the staff, from what I've experienced, are friendly enough. There is a small seating table on the first floor with more tables available on the second. They also sell several types of beer. This has always been a great late night place for nearby college students but I love it anytime of the day. MMMmmmmm.",1
212,2,1551312000000,"- Ideal location (next to Bellagio, Paris, Miracle Mile Shops...),
- Very comfortable rooms (stands comparison with high-end hotels on the strip),
- Calm atmosphere (there is no onsite casino),
- Proper service,
- Good prices. My average nightly fee was $159+tax for a 4-night stay and that was during the very busy week of spring break/march madness.
I can only recommend a stay at the Elara. The place is still in a transitional phase from being the flagship Westgate timeshare property to a Hilton Grand Vacations, the current decoration doesn't mirror that of traditional Hilton properties, but it's no big deal, the Elara is a great value.

I can't put 5* however for the following reasons:
1) Check-out time is 10:00am with no extension possible ... this is Vegas, what a sadistic rule!
2) The water is strange, a bit creamy; You get like an all-in-one shower and body lotion with a 'can't-wash-it-off' feel. Now, I know that this is Vegas and I should be grateful that water is freely available, so I wouldn't complain if it was not for the fact that YOU CAN'T DRINK THE TAP WATER AND THEY DON'T PROVIDE BOTTLED WATER IN THE ROOM, whether for free or for purchase, there is no mini-bar. Being able to drink something in the room is a base need of a hotel customer. 

One more thing about water. Why would a hotel room that sleeps two and with no stove need a family-size dishwasher? Well, we used two cups to drink our coffees in the morning and placed them in the sink. When we came back to the room the dishwasher was on!! It's a shame, hotel management needs to educate cleaning personnel to water conservation! I almost gave 1* to this review because of that, but angry reviews are not helpful ones. I hope the hotel management is reading that.",2

Fridays the have their feature brisket, which is super moist and tender. Totally recommend this.

Noticed on their menu they have a tomato ramen $10.75 that included a scallop and one piece of pork.  Was very excited to try it out since I never had anything like this at other ramen restaurants.  It was better than I expected.  The scallop was the best part and it looked to be freshly shucked and not those small bay scallops.  The soup tasted like tomato soup with some Asian spices.  The noodles were nice and chewy.  The egg was done well with a creamy yoke.  The pork was a bit dry and flavour of it was overpowered by the soup.  Would definitely get this again.,2

224,2,1549843200000,I've been here twice. The rooms are very large. The first time I came my sister and I stayed on the 2nd floor and we were scared by a ghost in our room. Totally unexpected! I liked the pool and the gambling was good. Buffet is alright. Italian restaurant was really good! totally recommend.,1
232,1,1550707200000,"Stopped in for breakfast while in the area. 
Excellent food, service and clean.
I had the Chicken Fried Steak with hash browns and two eggs.
Everything on the plate was excellent.
My only complaint was with me. I spilled gravy on my shirt and my shirt did not appreciate it as much as my taste buds.",2
235,3,1550707200000,"Best spot ever. Happy that I found a place that has bomb cold brew. On my last trip, I got cold brew with sea salt cream. It's a little bit on the sweeter side, but I didn't really mind it. The babe loved his hokkaido with boba as well, it was sweet but had a subtle taste to it. I realllly wanna get the cold brew again on my next trip, but I walked in there wanting to try atleast 5 other things!
As far as the service, it was really quick even though it was a full house. We were able to grab a table right after ordering. I wish this spot was bigger and ""study"" friendly with big tables! (Yeah, no, I will definitely just people watch and search random things on my laptop)",2

I love spicy food and on their 1-10 scale you're taking your life in your hands at anything above a 6, but even if you go really spicy you still taste the food. I've never been disappointed in anything I've had here, I can speak only of noodle and beef and chicken dishes but others in my group have spoken well of other dishes. It's not too pricey I think our last bill was around $60 plus tip which is good for 4 people. 

One more thing I wanted to point out,  on nights we were there there has been times where a guy that rocks the easy listening tunes with an acoustic guitar entertains the crowd and I love it.",2
240,2,1551139200000,"The worst experience we have ever had. We ended up not eating the 3 dishes we ordered and we didn't pay either. Terrible chicken/waffle, actually it doesn't contain that much chicken maybe an ounce. Greasy Batter is 5 times the thickness of the chicken and so damn dark unappetizing color looks like dog poop. The same for the jerk chicken. The mushrooms melt is inedible. Service was slow and salt dispenser had a bug inside. Water served at room temperature in warm glasses and the beer wasn't cold enough. Manager apologized however disagreed with our opinion and didn't charge us. We are frequent dinning out family and we are not new to Toronto restaurant scene. By any means sub standard food quality and quantity and flavor. I think we should have the choice of scoring zero star.",2

They fill up a small tub and stick your feet in it while you're sitting in a make-shift pedicure chair. The ""lounge"" is not a lounge what so ever. It's a tiny, closet sized room. It's only you and the person doing your nails in the room at one time. And it's a good thing because you couldn't fit another person in there!
The place was very clean and professional looking and I greatly enjoyed the nail technician and the conversation we had. But for the price, you can go somewhere else and get a much better pedicure...",3

I wish they could of have a few trash cans. I know it is not the Cosmo or Aria but it might need a bit more upgrades like the showers, carpet, furniture. Not saying they are but again, Hilton just bought out this once owned Planet Hollywood and are in the process of a major overhall change.

I was hungry so I went inside & was seated right away! I ordered the chips & salsa appetizer. That was the best salsa I've ever had in my life! Fo sho! It was ground up fine in a spaghetti sauce consistency- no big chunks of onion! 4 the main course I had the chicken- fried steak. Its a favorite of mine! It was off the chain except, like other times, I bit in2 a chewy chunk of fat a couple times! Besides that everything was really good!

The waitress was gracious, immediately sharing recommendations when she learned it was our first visit.. and continued to help us thru as we ordered addtl dishes later.

The dishes were visually presented such as in a high end restaurant and I don't think pricing is out of line at all for this style of food (Japanese IS expensive).  The garlic miso clams in risotto was so clever in presentation and extremely rich and savory (cilantro alert!).  We just enjoyed our meal from beginning to end.",2
253,2,1548979200000,"I have dined in this location multiple times and their food never disappoints. 

Food: 4.5 out of 5 stars... So far I have tried their lumpia, fishballs, chicken adobo, crispy pata, seafood kare-kare, caldereta, beaf steak, nilagang baka, pancit Malabon, pork barbecue, and chicken barbecue. I would say that their crispy pata, chicken adobo, and barbecue (both chicken and pork) are probably the best ones I've had. These are Filipino food that I rarely crave and usually just grab small pieces when served but after tasting theirs, I now crave for them. I loved their pancit malabon when I ordered it to dine in the restaurant but when I ordered a party tray for new year's eve, there wasn't enough sauce in my tray (still tasted good though). Their seafood kare-kare is also a bomb but I just wish they peeled the shrimp skin before cooking because it's pain to peel them coming out of kare-kare sauce.

Service: 4 out of 5 stars... Their service is way, way better compared to other Filipino places I have visited. Servers are very nice but service can be slow sometimes (hence minus one star). When I came to pick up my party tray orders for new year's eve, I appreciated how the staff has packed them to make sure nothing gets splattered during the drive and they even gave me nice box carriers so I can carry multiple food trays all at ones. I, however, had to wait for more than half an hour after my designated pick-up time before I was able to get all of my orders. 

Place: 4 out of 5 stars... Again, it is way cleaner than a lot of Filipino places I have been to. However, I think the ventilation is not adequate enough because the kitchen smell really gets into the dining area. Their bathroom is also clean but feels like a sauna! They are also located in a relatively safer and way nicer neighborhood as compared to most Filipino places.

Prices: 4.5 out of 5 stars... slightly more expensive than a lot of Filipino places but I completely don't mind due to way better quality of food.

Overall, I will definitely keep coming back despite their location being slightly far from where I live.",1
255,2,1549324800000,Place is less than stellar. I got the chicken kabob salad and it was less than stellar. Fries were gross and very soggy. Place is mediocre at best and they charge more than any other greek place around here. I wouldt go here again.,2
257,2,1550016000000,"I love the originality with their signature toppings and their ice cream. Also, the owner (the guy) is very helpful and nice.

I ordered the matcha red bean mochi with matcha/vanilla tiffany blue soft serve ice cream.  What I like about Dolce is the toppings are fresh (mochi and red bean) and the ice cream is not too sweet.

I would be coming back to this place again to try the other flavours they have and their candy milkshakes",2

I have 2 big and hairy dogs and let's just say Justin had his work cut out for him cleaning my 10'x13' sectional couch with chaise lounge! It took about 5 hours to complete the job which was more than I expected but he did the impossible so I can't even complain! My couch looks like new again and even threw in the area rug as part of the cleaning!! I am so relieved that they were able to fit me in so quick and did such a great job.

Please Note: This is just not a restaurant. You can also go to smoke hookah if that is your thing. I don't smoke, but I noticed when I go in there the smoke from the hookahs doesn't disturb me, and make want to run away from it like cigarettes and all to the opposite side. or make me cough when I wait for the food.

276,2,1549065600000,"Evening of 7/28/2016
This place is a dirty disaster. 
First of all, the staff was blasting gangsta rap, it was so loud that I had to ask the guy at the counter to repeat himself several times while taking our order. They were out of watermelon and several ingredients for the hummus sandwich. Tables inside were not clean (and the loud music continued) so we had to sit outside in the summer heat. 

The Thai wrap I ordered not only came with wilted, overly marinated lettuce, and dry chicken, but I found a plastic clasp in my sandwich, you know the kind that comes on every loaf of grocery store bread that keeps the bag closed? Yeah, that happened. I took it back to the counter immediately and the staff only said ""oh, sorry about that"". I guess they're ok with making harmful mistakes in people's food. Biting into plastic and almost swallowing it, was not fun. 

All other food in our order was ok, absolutely nothing special. Mostly slapped together and not worth the $30 I spent at all. We didn't order smoothies, but we also will NOT be back to try them, either. Pretty bad on every level, especially the service and atmosphere. Yuck, yuck, yuck!",2
277,3,1550620800000,"got takeout from here the other night with the boy and was pleasantly surprised. don't know if i'd sit down and eat in-house (quite small and with all the pickups it was really busy and cold) but definitely our place to go for takeout. 
i got the tofu with veggies and garlic sauce...tofu was done just right and the veggies were nice and crisp still, just the way i like it. the sauce wasn't overly-oily and had a great flavor, and the rice was perfectly cooked.
the boy got general tso's chicken (extra spicy) and loved every bite of it.
prices are totally fair (about $8 for each dish and we had leftovers for another meal the next day) and the service is awesome.  
though this is for sure ""americanized"" chinese food, it definitely hit the spot and we will return.",2
282,2,1549584000000,Soup dumplings are soooo good. U should definitely try their bubble tea!!! Pork belly is kind of sweet to me. Noodles are good choice for coming to the store.,3
287,2,1549324800000,"They just rolled out a new menu that I am not a big fan of. All breakfast sandwiches, burritos, and wraps were removed from the menu. With the exception of the pastries, everything is now build-your-own.

In addition to a complete overhaul of their menu, they were completely out of a handful of ingredients they had listed on their new menu. I was so overwhelmed with their extensive list of ingredients and options, I ended up just getting coffee (which is always a winning decision here).

I most likely won't be eating here again. If I wanted to build my own breakfast, I would have just stayed at home. Restaurants and cafes are supposed to share and suggest what THEY'RE good at making, not what ingredients they have for me to choose from.

Sorry Urban Beans, as a coffee shop, you get 5/5, but as a cafe, I'm now giving you 1/5.",2
288,1,1549065600000,"I booked & paid for my non-smoking room 2 months in advance. Upon arrival @ 4:30 pm (30 min after the standard check in) my room was still not ready at 6:00 pm. After I went to the front desk to inquire they did however give me a smoking room. 

I walked into my room which had very hard linoleum floors. I looked for a place to charge my devices but, all outlets were in use and there were no extra outlets you typically find at all hotels today. I needed to unplug multiple lamps to plug in my multipe devices so they could charge.

After I sorted through the ""re-wiring"" of my room I went to take a shower at 6:15 pm. I was only able to take a 2 min shower as the water was so cold. 

After my night out I went to sleep and woke up so cold because the comforter is very thin. 

When I woke up and attempted to take a shower at 7:30 am the shower had no hot water. I could only manage to comfortably wash my face and wet my hair in the sink. 

The cost of my king bed room was $470! There was not room ammenities / appliences. There were no outlets to charge your devices, thin blankets, I didn't get the room reserved, &there was NO hot water! It was bare bone. 

I will never book a night at the Flamingo ever again!",2
290,2,1549584000000,"Very fun and trendy vibe.  Loved the drink menu options, but I made a bad choice getting the ""The Pink Drink"", very sweet (I was warned) and just not what I was expecting.  The Waldorf salad was ok, but not much flavor at all.  My entree was recommended, it was chicken stuffed with crab.  Only ok.  Huge serving, it was probably enough for two.  Seemed like two chicken breasts breaded and fried, with crab in between.  Very good but not great, I would have preferred a smaller more tasty portion.  All in all a nice dinner, abiance was fantastic, but I must have made bad ordering choices because my meal was not as great I expected it to be from the looks of this place, it was pretty packed!  I'd try it again.",2
295,1,1549929600000,"I popped in today for my first time after dreaming about corned beef sandwiches for months. 

And I was sort of disappointed.

While the staff were really nice, the food quality just wasn't there. The corned beef was really soft and almost slimy. And for $10, the quantity wasn't there either. I mean, you go to... even Pickle Barrel, and you'll get a healthy (heh heh heh) amount of food placed in front of you. Here, though... for $10, you get a pretty small sandwich and a solo pickle wrapped up (kind of lazily) in some saran wrap.

Overall? I might go again, but definitely not for the $10 meat sandwich. They have salads and soups which might be worth while? Oh. And what took it from a 2/5 to a 3/5? One of the staff says ""beauty"" after everything you say.

""Mustard?"" ""Yes, please."" ""Beauty.""

""White or brown?"" ""Brown."" ""Beauty.""

I was polite and even tempered given the situation and she still told me to go downstairs because I "" didn't have a key"" therefore wasn't supposed to be on the hotel floor.  I paid for 4 nights but she didn't seem to care, then called security. They came up and told me to leave as well. I just tried to explain but they told me it wasn't their problem.   RUDE! Long story short the hotel manager short breathed us and sent us to front desk to the same rude lady.  I just wanted to get in my room, and an apology would be nice!!!",1

I got literally a slice of corned beef in each deck.  What a joke, at druxy's for half the price I get 3 times the amount.  It's as if they used the third slice of bread to keep the weight of the sandwich up.  After complaining (which I never do) to our non-existent server, they gave a 10% discount, on the sandwich only.  I freaking dollar, but they were probably expecting me to go across to metro and buy some corned beef from their deli instead.

Try the cantaloupe: it has pieces of cubed cantaloupe in it. So refreshing. Prices: two bucks fifty per taco, three per if you order tongue. Try them out and enjoy!",3

I liked the spicy aspect of it I think they might use jalapeños, for not being a cornbread fan thumbs up for sure. I had the rotisserie chicken with mole amarillo. I'm always apprehensive about big pieces of chicken some rely on the sauce because they are dry as the Sahara! NOT here it was moist and delicious and the partial skin that remained had a nice crispiness to it. Wild mushroom meatloaf, wow I guess I haven't tasted meatloaf since I was a child at my Great Aunt's house, I didn't know it could be succulent and slightly pink in the middle and not brown like a hockey puck! Who knew? Delicious. Only complaint was the ""seasonal vegetable"" broccoli I love broccoli; However usually when you get broccoli at a restaurant the pieces are separated so you can pick one up at a time with your fork right? This was a head of broccoli connected at the bottom in one blob which required cutting leaving the base that no one eats on the plate. Not a fan of that, otherwise thumbs up!",2

338,1,1549065600000,"I picked this hotel because I was running the Rock n' Roll Marathon and I needed a quiet, nonsmoking room, with a kitchenette to cook a pre race meal, and a large tub to soak in post race.The Trump is beautiful from lobby to room to view to spa to pool, but their service is beyond lacking. I know service, good, bad, and indifferent. I've dealt with the full range of customers from happy to abusive and unreasonable for 12 years. Accidents happen, but how problems are resolved makes the difference between a positive and negative experience. 

The room was beautiful and well decorated. The TV in the bathroom mirror was a nice touch, ended up switching rooms and it didn't work in the second room but you couldn't see it from the tub anyway. The whirlpool tub was by far the best part of the room. It was huge. My boyfriend is 6'4"" and was able to stretch out in it. The towels and robes were soft and thick and didn't leave any lint after bathing. The view of the Wynn/Encore and Fashion Mall was stunning especially at night. The Spa is amazing; spacious, luxurious treatment rooms, showers, and a wonderful lounge area with teas and water. On the down side, neither of our cell phones had use-able signal beyond the lobby (AT&T and T-mobile), the bathroom floor was sticky.

 The bell/doormen were friendly, welcoming, and recognized me after the first day. The spa staff was professional and met my expectations. Where things went wrong began with housekeeping and ends with management.

We checked in and unpacked putting most of out items in drawers and left do some shopping before dinner reservations for our anniversary. When we returned to our room three hours after checking in, housekeeping (I'm assuming) threw out all our toiletries and the food I brought to cook (I didn't notice the food until we switched rooms, and by that point I felt like I was such an inconvenience to them I just let it go). After filling out security paperwork, management offered to refund the mandatory resort fee, a whopping $15. The desk manager did call our restaurant for us, at my request, and we were given a ride in the house car to the restaurant, unfortunately I felt like we were lucky to get that instead of having to take a taxi, or the nice leisurely stroll up the Strip as we had planned.

Security was professional and accommodating in trying to resolve the situation, but the desk manager made us feel like ""problem guests"" and that everything being done was above and beyond excellent customer care.

The GM did not sit down with us face to face, we had to argue over the phone about what had happened and what they could do for us. Eventually, the GM agreed to a room upgrade and a late check out. We were satisfied with that and just wanted to put it all behind us. 

The late check out we were begrudgingly promised didn't go smoothly either. We packed in the morning, left for lunch and some gambling,  we returned to checkout and were locked out of out room. After sorting that out I got the bill and the resort fees that were supposed to be refunded were still on the bill. All in all, it was just a big hassle.",2

My debit card was about to expire and I was deployed so I tried calling the number to update my card information before my payment date. I called and left messages and never received a response. I then called corporate and I guess they're going through a merger with a another company so they couldn't update my information. They told me they would leave the store a message on their computer. Still no response. Finally got someone when I called (third day of trying) asked if I could update my information, it was just my expiration date and the three digit number on the back. She insisted I do it online or I needed to come in. Ok, I can do it online but I need all of my information like my gate code and unit number which I don't remember off the top of my head. After making my roommate back home dig through all of my stuff we finally got the info only to see that I was being charged $132. A notification would've been nice.

The chilaquiles were just ok. Definitely needed more salt, more salsa- just more flavor in general. I would return and try something else.

I find the staff to be friendly, unpretentious (this is Yorkville) and funny and the decor is nice with a faux kitchen for decoration. The main thing that stops me from hanging out here more often (with laptop in hand) is that they don't provide free wifi. They are doing themselves a great disservice because of this.

I was ok with the agreement but wished I didn't need to call them 5 weeks later to confirm that my project had been completed for 2. Eh. Good things take a while?,2
366,1,1550793600000,I had been here once before and I thought it was okay.. But since it's close I decided to try again and it was awful. The girl was not friendly at all and all she did was gossip with the other lady. I tried asking a question and she was rude. Then she was buffing my toe nails and buffed my skin. It hurt so bad and I had a a cut for awhile after. I would never go back ever.,1

389,3,1549238400000,"I can't recommend this company highly enough. Eco-Fresh is based in Scottsdale. They specialize in green carpet, area rug, and upholstery cleaning throughout the valley.

I moved into an older condo in February. The previous owner had been here 20 years, owned pets, and was pretty lax about cleaning.The day before I moved, I had Eco-Fresh in to take care of the carpet as well as my area rug and sofa. 

Eco-Fresh uses Green Seal Certified products, and there's nothing but a ""clean"" smell after they've finished.The techs were punctual, competent, and friendly. The charges were exactly as estimated, and the results were fantastic. I had them back yesterday to clean the sofa (it's vintage, the upholstery is unique, and my cat lives on it). The service was again impeccable, and the results again perfect.

Philip, June, and staff will answer all questions about alternative cleaning methods and are very responsive about scheduling.  If you're interested in greening your home, or if you have rugs and furniture that need gentleness, this company is a great choice!",2
393,2,1549238400000,"Met up with some of my favorites for lunch...Terri R, Suzy H, and the current Duchess of Fix8, Shirley B. 

Fix8 Fitness Cafe is located in Henderson off Horizon Ridge. Their specialty...clean eats.  Your choices are healthy ones of course. You can select off their menu, which include Steaks, Fish, Turkey, Chicken, and Salads. This joint even has Loco Moco's. There's multiple combos to choose from, but I decided to customize mine to a large order of steak (8 oz clean / no seasoning), mushrooms, and some greens.  The steak was prepared medium, was tender, and full of flavor even though it was clean. The broccoli was also tender, if that even makes sense.  In my opinion, the prices are fair considering the portions and the staff here is great. I will probably be back since I'm in the area every once in awhile. 

My Wishlist:
-Although you can customize your order, the prices should be adjusted if you decide to take something off the combo. I deleted the rice and instead of giving me the option to pay less, I was only given the option to substitute. In fact, I paid an extra $1 because I chose broccoli. I guess broccoli cost a full $1 more than rice.
-Add Bison and Ostrich to the menu

1st visit- waited 20 MINUTES for a waitress to come to our table to greet us because they all were in a ""meeting"". Another 45 minutes waiting on the food and another 10 minutes for the waitress to finally bring us silverware. Service awful, food was good. I ordered a chicken philly and spin dip.

2nd visit- service was better, food was terrible, sent back for being burnt, came back out burnt again... how difficult is it to fry French fries? 

3rd/final visit- 45 minutes to get a mimosa at brunch time... wasn't crowded at all. Left to go eat elsewhere",1

I tried the chicken tacos (good), tostada salad (really good), tortilla soup (decent) and chicken nachos (decent). I would like to drink an entire carafe of their green salsa. Is that weird? I don't care.",2

The Arizona chicken rolls are an appetizer that can't be missed. They have a wide variety of beers brewed in house so they are always fresh. The atmosphere is welcoming and energetic. This is a great place to catch a sporting event or bring larger groups. The venue usually plays host to a college town crowd and is usually busy but never overwhelming. Service is usually very good. If friends are visiting from out of town, this is where we will go every time. Four Peaks is a Phoenix area staple as far as I am concerned.",2

Leo gave me a beautiful tattoo at an amazing price and made sure I was comfortable at all times. Very professional and friendly! Not your typical cocky tattoo shop. I highly recommend them and will definitely come back for more ink!

I walked the strip looking for quotes and I was given a price that I thought was reasonable compared to an off the strip price, what I would've paid at home. We printed off my ideas in the shop, paid a deposit and set an appointment. When I arrived for my appointment a few days later, Leo was set up, ready to go and seemed as excited as I was for my new tattoo. He was quick and light handed...I have no scarring from someone grinding a needle into my skin. Just a beautifully healed tattoo with great shading.

Chicken Pot Pie Nuggets - pretty good... Kacey loved them.. I enjoyed them. Decent flavor, great texture. 3.5/5

Inside Out French Onion Grilled Cheese - pretty much same as above. I wasn't thrilled but enjoyed it. 3.5/5

Bacon Wrapped Bacon & Egg - awesome!!!... my favorite plate of night. Got this off server recommendation and it did not disappoint. Very cool presentation... server recommended doing in one bite but was a little big to do that.. tried.. and failed. LOL Still a fun dish and would order again and again. 5/5

 Buffalo Burger - maybe it's me & my untrained palette but I did not like this at all. Probably the wrong thing to order looking back. Should have read the menu more. The flavors didn't go well for me and I ended up throwing half of this away. I'm sure there are people that love this but for me... meh. 1/5

18 Hour Citrus Braised Veal Cheeks - really, really tasty. Great flavor & cooked perfect. Worth $34? That can be debated... I don't have anything to base that price off of. Never ordered Braised Veal Cheeks before... would have like to see more meat at that price though. 4.5/5

Cookies & Milk - ummmm... it's hard to go wrong when you are serving fresh, hot cookies. The chocolate chip were delicious but could have used few more chocolate chips. Outside of that it was great. 4.5/5

Service was good, ambience is really cool... love the decor. This is another strip restaurant that I would love to frequent if it wasn't for the price. Great for tourists... not priced for your average local.",2

All of the reviews raved about their happy hour which I'd be missing since I wouldn't be off work in time. We went down anyways for dinner since the food reviews were pretty good. 

I was expecting this place to be a restaurant but its TOTALLY more like a bar. The tables were tiny and the music was blaring. We ordered several dishes for dinner which barely fit on the table at the same time. The food was good but I was expecting a normal sit-down dinner which we didn't get.

Case in point - when everyone raves about happy hour at a place on yelp - go there for happy hour, not dinner!",2

The owner, Tony is extremely knowledgeable and polite which really adds to the experience.

Its got a great hipster vibe, a roll up door for summer patio coffee, beautiful exposed wood beams, and wood lined counter.

The coffee is out of this world with many options. I personally had a blend directly delivered from Brazil. I also had a rose flavored donut which tasted like it was made just for me.

I've gone to a couple other places to get my Brazilian to test out the waters but most of them was actually pretty painful compared to the wax they use here. The staff has always been really friendly and welcoming. They never push you to purchase more waxes even though they do have some good deals.

Their Brazilian wax is only $33!! And I think first time customers get a discount... Not sure though but still check them out. :) It's rare to find places that cheap with such good quality.",2

This was my first time here. When we arrived the outside was a little deceiving, meaning old looking. But when we entered the inside was nice. The theme was rustic. One suggestion is, we asked to sit by the window and we noticed right away that our table was on a slant by the window. Maybe you could look into fixing this. Expect to pay about $30 a plate here. There were a few less expensive options but not much. At the end, with our bill we were given a coupon which was a nice touch.",1

The only thing was that it was a large group of us and we had to write down our orders on pieces of paper, which somehow got confusing.  Then we waited a long time for the food to come.  
So the gist is, they are not well equipped to handle large groups last minute.  But i should think everything would be fine if you go with a small group of people.",2

In the summer their tomatoes seem almost home-grown which is a big plus.  The food is good and the portions are large.  This is not a Mickey D's substitute, it probably more closely competes with Five Guys and I think it is better, and a better value.",2

We were one of only three tables in the restaurant and we were left waiting a long time for both water refills and our check, each time our server was talking and laughing with another employee at the front of the restaurant. The dining area was very clean but restrooms and what I could see of the kitchen didn't seem super sanitary. The food was good, but nothing that's going to blow you away. My favorites were the yellow lentils and stewed chicken. Pretty sure the ""lamb"" we were served was actually goat. We frequent a birria (Mexican goat restaurant) and goat has a distinctive flavor, as does lamb which we frequently eat at home. Goat is also quite a bit less expensive than lamb. We didn't bring it up to the server but would just like truth in advertising. A little pricey for the amount of food you receive, especially when you consider the complete lack of ambiance and slow service.",2

I tried to talk to a brainless robot named Nathan DeHaan but after 2 hours of him rolling his eyes at me, giving me dirty looks, and completely disrespecting me I knew it was time to leave.

The employees are incredibly rude, and they will lie about your food almost arriving, so you won't cancel your order. Once the food arrives, it's cold.

However, this review is not based on yogurt, it is based completely on my issues with gift cards at this location. I have been to this Yogurtology location three times now. I have tried to use two different gift cards (from two different people) each of those three times. Unfortunately, they have not been able to accept my gift cards during any of my three visits. No one seems to know why, but I am thoroughly frustrated. Once they told me that their computers didn't accept gift cards yet, another time I was informed that their computers were down altogether, and the most recent time I was told that my gift cards didn't have any money on them. I find it difficult to believe that I received two gift cards from two separate people and neither of them have a balance. The girl working there was polite enough and suggested that I go up to the Scottsdale location where my gift cards were purchased and ask them. That's more effort than I'm willing to put in at this point.

The crepe was very thin and light. Inside it was packed with thick-cut savory apples, bacon, and cheddar cheese. But the stand-out dish was the potato one. Home fries topped with veggies (asparagus, peppers, onions) and amaaaazing goat cheese. Like, I've had goat cheese, but this! It was tangy and creamy, but almost like ricotta in texture. And it was plentiful.

Quality maple syrup was served with our crepes. I poured half onto the dish and sipped the rest. Why isn't this stuff served in the states? I'm tired of the thick corn-syrupy crap. This was thin, sweet, and rich.",2
598,3,1550620800000,"Oh man, I'm torn on this place. 

I used to go to the GameWorks on the Strip when I was kid. I mean, I even remember going to the original grand opening and losing mind because it was so amazing, two stories of video games! That's a lot for a 14-year-old boy to handle. Now this new GameWorks location is in Town Square and it's not like the one of yesteryear, but more of a sports bar fused with a Chuck E. Cheese. 

They added a few new things like a full bowling alley, which looks amazing, a huge bar for the alcoholic pinball lovers, and a few hundred TVs. I like the lay out here also; there are two main entrances on each side of the building, which is super convenient, and the length of the bar is great because I don't like feeling like I'm sitting on the guy next to me. The have an okay mix of games, but I feel like they need to incorporate more of the classics. They have ""Donkey Kong"" and ""Centipede"", plus a few others, but this isn't enough of the old school favorites. I hate to say it, but my age and demo will be the main customers frequenting this place and if you don't up the nostalgia factor here you might be setting yourself up for the ultimate, GAME OVER. The other side of this is most ""little"" kids or hardcore gamers would rather stay in their room and play ""Call of Duty"" with some other kid from Germany. They don't want to be bothered with socializing or paying for something they already have at home. I'm voting for Super Mario 3!

Once I was done playing Skee-Ball and destroying some T-1000s on the Terminator shooter game I needed something in my belly. I still had stuff to do that day so I ordered a Cesar salad and some fries, you know...keeping it lite. These were good by ""Barcade"" standards. The salad was big and fresh and the french fries came with this cocktail sauce infused ketchup, pretty tasty! Of course I had to order a cocktail before I left, ""One Moscow Mule please"". (keeping it lite) This was actually the shining light of my visit. Sweet, tangy, and refreshing with just enough vodka and ginger. 

All in all, it was an OK experience and I feel like they are still working out some of the kinks, hence the three star rating. It's definitely not the GameWorks that was stuck in my memory, but I will be back to give it a second chance. Plus, who else will dominate all the little kids on the Pac-Man Air Hockey game.",2
603,2,1549152000000,"I experienced over a one hour wait to be seen for a first visit. Dr. Jeffy performed a very quick and incomplete skin check, barely looking at the skin under my gown.  She was very aloof and did hardly any speaking besides asking me if I wore sunscreen. When I asked her about a specific spot on my skin, she said ""oh that is nothing"", yet on the portal,in my record it appears that those areas do indeed have a name, yet that was not explained to me.  Her staff called me with biopsy results and started the conversation with 'now don't freak out"", I find this very unprofessional. When I returned for an excisional biopsy the door of the procedure room was opened and closed several times during the procedure. I was not able to see if someone entered or left the room, which is very disconcerting when you are in such a vulnerable position. I was seriously concerned about maintaining any kind of sterility, not to mention my privacy. Sorry, I cannot recommend this office as is not at all caring or compassionate and is clearly more interested in cosmetic dermatology than medical care.",3
607,2,1549756800000,Giving one star only because the food was decent. Other than that this place is a joke. Missed a movie because the food took over an hour and the waitress was clueless.

612,3,1550620800000,I went in and looked at the menu. There was very little options. It was like a lunch ayce restaurant. The price was expensive considering the food selection. The sushi was average. I just wish they had more options. The service was bad. The server was rude and not welcoming.,2
622,1,1550620800000,"It probably speaks volumes about me that Mantra Masala's tagline as ""Healthy cuisine from India!"" really put me off this restaurant for a long time.  I wasn't sure I wanted to go out for ""healthy"" food, but after two years of living a stone's throw from this restaurant finally a craving for Indian without the strings attached of driving around town won out and we gave it a shot.

Overall I am pleased we did. There's no buffet on offer here, but the dinner menu., while small, features some tasty fare. I enjoyed my Chicken Tikka Masala and the samosas were different (and rather heavy) from what I am used to, but really excellent. 

My wife enjoyed her Shahi Paneer and we both loved the papadums and naan.

The portion sizes are fairly standard for an Indian Restaurant, so don't expect USA sized portions and the prices are pretty reasonable without being bargain priced.

Mantra Masala isn't my favourite Indian place in town, but it's certainly convenient and a worthy contender for if you live nearby.",2
633,2,1550102400000,"Bargain service for maybe $35, but a ridiculous rip off for the $70 I was charged for gel/shellac manicure and regular pedicure. The massage for each of my services was literally 60-120 seconds, using cheap lotion. I asked for my nails to be square with rounded edges (to reduce corner Sharpness,) but found myself filing my own nails that night to fix them. (Seemed like she was more interested in my eyebrows, than my nails!) My technician also cut my toe with the cuticle cutter, and I ended up with my toe wrapped in a Neosporin soaked bandage in order to prevent infection and stop pain. They economized on hot towels using one on arms and one on legs to remove lotion only; not to wrap limbs for muscle relaxation and to open pores. This place was a referral from the Concierge at the The Hotel at Mandalay, as I had asked for a referral in the area because i was attending an event in that area. I brought 3 friends with me for the same services, and we were all done in 1 hour. Ultimately, we received express service at a strip mall nail shop at resort prices, and I was injured to boot! Dissatisfied is an understatement!",2

637,3,1550361600000,"I've been to Padre's twice now - once for a full dinner and a second time for a margarita and a bite. I really like the bar area, find the service to be friendly and attentive, and think that certain dishes on the are top-notch. On the downside, the dining area (as opposed to the bar) is dull, the parking is tight, and the margaritas aren't all they're cracked up to be. 

Both times we've gone, we've really loved the food. The cilantro mousse was a really interesting and different accompaniment to chips, and the black bean soup was a flavorful and rich starter. As far as main dishes,  the duck tacos are absolutely outstanding. Wow. We ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside. I'm not a huge steak person, and I love the way their duck combines the juiciness and charred texture of steak with the lightness of poultry. Both times, we also had super-friendly servers who were very attentive. 

We did not fall head-over-heels for the margaritas, though. We tried the $5 Padre's Margarita and found it to be way too sweet. Not the worst margarita we've had, but nothing outstanding either; I much prefer the house margaritas at Z Tejas if I'm going to go cheap, or the fresh-squeezed/hand-mixed ones at McCormick's if I feel like splurging. 

We also weren't huge fans of the dining area. The first time, we chose to sat there, whereas the second time we were offered a table since the bar area was full. It's just kind of closed off and uninspiring, with ugly gold ceiling fans and no windows. Atmosphere isn't everything, but it would be nice for the dining area to complement or highlight the inventiveness and passion that clearly goes into the food. 

A few final notes: 

1. Parking is tight, and even if you're lucky enough to find a spot in front, good luck getting out of it. I had to do a three-point turn just to pull out of the angled spot! 
2. There appears to be a big patio on the left side of the building. I'm not sure if food is served there, but it looked like a really pretty spot to have a drink and talk.
3. Happy hour is M-F from 4-6 pm in the bar area only. Beer is $2.50, margaritas are $3, mojo martinis and wine of the day are $5, and mojitos are $6. There is a special 6-item bar food menu with prices ranging from $5 to $7.",2
645,3,1549238400000,"First let me say our waiter was FANTSTIC!  Now I have to say the people in the kitchen don't measure up to the wait staff. I had the  KiNG PARMESAN DE EGGPLANT which in the menu is described as ""We take an abundance of beautiful eggplant prepared for it's finest hour and cover it with Italian and Parmano cheeses, special marinara, fresh basil and gently lay it over angel hair pasta. It's served alongside our garlic bread and made fresh daily, so get yours before we run out!""  NOPE!  Let's start with the ""abundance of beautiful eggplant"" which in reality is a thin pile of two way over cooked pieces of soggy mush.  It was just this side of slimy gross. How you can do that with a pan-fired item is beyond me.  Next let's consider the ""special marinara"" which is next to non-existent in this dish.  There was not nearly enough to give even a thin coat of sauce to the pasta.  Now let's  talk ""angel hair pasta""  Al dente it ain't!  Overcooked to just before turning into mush it was.  Maybe that is so it has the same texture, or lack thereof, as the eggplant.  It was so over cooked I could not twist it on to my fork!  It just wasn't about to put up with such a technique.  The spoon they put on the plate when they serve you the meal was there, I now believe, for scooping up the overcooked pasta, not for helping to wind it onto the fork.   Now let's talk ""our garlic bread"".  Large crunchy crouton is a more apt description.  This gum shredding morsel was way beyond stale. There was not one speck of soft bread in it.  Why there is a line waiting to eat at this place is a total mystery to me.",2
646,3,1550448000000,"Pulled in to the parking lot and there were no spaces so our initial thought was, ""They're busy. We'll come back some other time.""

We order a few minutes after that. I built my own omelette and she ordered the Eggs Benedict. Everything came out fast and correctly and Sharon was an EXCELLENT waitress. I highly recommend this place!",2
665,1,1549152000000,"I want to give this place a 0 Star if possible. This place has hype and was curious to try but I would not waste time here when there is so many options now in TO.
We ordered a lime tea drink and mixed fruit drink that had overly complicated names. The cashier didn't even know the drinks and there was confusion with the cup sizes since some drinks only come in one size and special cups that were more expensive. (Money grab)
The worst was the wait. We waited at least 45 mins for two drinks when there was only 4-5 people inline up. This place is famous for line ups because they are artificially created with super slow service. Workers were chatting with each other and took their time with drinks. What usually takes mins to make a drink took 30 mins!

The over medium eggs were perfect, the side of potato were averarge, not bad So , all in all decent.  The coffee was hot and fresh and verry good.  The waitress was friendly and okay.

I called and made an appointment and was told that this was for an outside plumbing problem but they would be happy to come out and give me a free estimate.  Great, I thought, thinking it couldn't be much more to clear a simple bathtub drain.  I had the day after Christmas off so I made an appointment that day between 8 - 10 AM.  The service person arrived at 10:30 and didn't call to let me know they were arriving late.  He ran some water in my tub and then said he would have to use his snake (or whatever it's called) to clear the drain and that would be $200.  To which I exclaimed ""$200, why didn't the phone person tell me it was going to cost that much?""  He said the phone person was not a plumber and didn't know.  I'm sure she knew what it would cost if had to use the rooter to clear the drain.  I hate it when someone assumes they can get away with this sort of thing!  Really.....how else would they clear a drain???  With a toothpick????  The funny thing is, he didn't even take the time to take off the drain plug and look.  Had the man done this like the service person from Option One Plumbing & Rooter (who, by the way, will clear your drain for $49.50), perhaps he would not have had to use his rooter.  They wonderful young man from Option One used his rooter just to be on the safe side, and still only charged me $49.50.  I would not recommend this company AT ALL!!",2

The food, of course, was the star of the show.  We came with a few (15ish) friends and got a variety of their entrees, including the steaks (for the guys) and salmon (for the girls).  The steaks were great, and you couldn't go wrong with the 16oz prime rib or the 8oz filet.  They also had an ""ultimate steak"" option which we were not man enough to try.  Essentially, you share with anywhere from 2-6 people, and on average each person would get about 20oz of steak, as well as a couple sides.  Maybe next time, we'll tackle this challenge.

  Even though it is taking longer to get the treatment here than at another dental office, it is worth it!
  We were quoted over $8000 for her dental work through several dentists. At Midwestern, we paid a fraction of that cost. My daughter had no dental insurance at the time, so the cost was a very big factor in my decision to have her treated here.
  The doctors are top notch and the students we've dealt with have all been eager, caring, and have gone above and beyond to make both my daughter (Who was 8 when we started her treatment plan) and I comfortable. 
  It can take a while to get an appointment, but it is worth the wait! 
  The campus is clean, as is the clinic. I recommend Midwestern to just about everyone I know.

Only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars was no bacon donut and/or cream filled.  Both of which I was looking forward to trying. All in all though, one dang good donut.

774,2,1551052800000,"A homegrown garden grows when it's cared for with love and by people who want it to thrive. The vegetables, herbs and fruits only survive if they are watered, given nutrients and protected in severe weather. In addition, the best of gardens have a green thumbed gardener overseeing the entire operation. The Phoenix Public Market reminds me of a cherished homegrown garden.

Just as if I was walking through a friend's house into their backyard of homegrown products, I walked into the Phoenix Public Market and immediately took in a whiff of fresh herbs, produce and products welcoming me inside. Freshly picked fruits and vegetables sat in the middle cooler and dairy, more produce, meat and other refrigerated treats such as hummus lingered in the left-hand cooler. In the back cooler, locally owned products such as Sweet Republic made their home in the freezer and then throughout the rest of the shop, locally owned delights sat on the shelves. There's everything from Desert Smoke BBQ sauce and Tracey Dempsey Originals, to locally owned cracker companies and plenty of dairy. It's easy to spend awhile exploring each and every product.

Now it's time to pick from the ""garden"" and talk about the restaurant portion of the market. Here they make everything including breakfast, salads, sandwiches and plenty of baked goods. Today I went for the fresh Turkey sandwich. My-oh-my was it delicious. Freshly roasted turkey hugged chewy wheat bread and fruit jam as well as a herb mayo spread kept the turkey and bread together. It's a simple sandwich but something about the combination of ingredients makes it much more than just simple. It tasted like a garden on my plate especially with the tomatoes and lettuce that accompanied it.

After my meal, I continued to sit in the grocery store and do some work while looking out on the Downtown buildings and beautiful vines growing on the market's patio. For a split second I forgot I was in 113 degree weather in Phoenix and pretended like I was sitting in a cool 75 degree San Francisco day; or better yet, a fresh garden overlooking an ocean. Finally, I finished my day with a meeting inside the coffee shop (Royal at the Market) and before I left, I browsed the outdoor Public Market that goes on every Wednesday night. It was a wonderful afternoon and the reason I love to live local so much.

This is clearly someplace where you can spend the entire day daydreaming and imagining you're in a garden. It's a pleasant atmosphere to do work in. The staff is extremely friendly, but they let people do their work and chat when guests are ready for a conversation.

** Some other highlights of the Market include a Chef Series where you can learn to cook and eat the food, wine tasting events, Food Truck Fridays (with many of my favorite local food trucks like Short Leash Dogs!) and of course the thing that started it all - the Public Market (come on Wednesday night and Saturday mornings)",2

One of the ladies does a hard sell on you when you ask for the 20 buck an hour foot massage.  She upsells you the $35 for the body and feet massage even though the foot massage I see includes some of the same massage as the $35 for the head and scalp. My friend and brother who only authorized the basic massaged appeared to frustrate her.  The scalp massage was abrasive for my brother and I.  When finished, I provided a $20 tip and asked for $5 back and to keep the rest.  not only did she demand to keep the 20 on the table but asked for an additional dollar because she massaged me for an hour.  Yeah. that was why I paid you the hourly rate for. The tip is extra and not supposed to be negotiable.  She looked at me angrily and demanded a 35% tip. Apparently they charge a low price and expect you to tip an outrageous amount to make up for it.  This place is shady and I recommend going somewhere else. I will never return.

I ordered Beef Stroganov, frankly excited to see it on their menu. (I have not had this dish for a long time.)  The table ordered iced tea. We returned them as the tea tasted that they forgot to put tea in the mix. There is the slighted hint of tea flavor, perhaps from tea made earlier in the day.
My Beef Stroganov finally appeared. It came with a sliver of bread. The meal was so salty that I was only able to eat have of it.

I got the house Tonkatsu ramen, which was so good. I like how the noodles were cooked perfectly. The meat was a bit fatty for my liking, but still very tender when eating it.

Warning for those who not a fan of the yolk being not fully cooked, who was my mom, it is a bit runny. 

As for the service, the girl that was serving us was absolutely the sweetest. She was always smiling and made sure that our tea cups were never empty. We also sat for a bit and we did not feel like we were rushed out of there at all.

886,1,1549065600000,"My husband and I visited Amelie's Bakery before a concert nearby.  
I work closeby and I know Amelie's is very good as I had ordered cookies and lattes before.

We were extremely disappointed during this visit.  the 2 pastries we ordered were just awful.  I ordered the Napoleon.  the cream inside was FROZEN.  I'm sorry, this is a bakery???? what is wrong with this picture.  My husband ordered apple crisp.  it was HARD ROCK.  couldn't even eat it.  He took it back and they said. 'oh, you should have asked to be warmed up'.  so, we said, ok, warm it up.  sat there with our lattes waiting.  10 min. later, they apologized and said it will be ready in 5 minutes.  they forgot to warm it up??  even after warming up, it still wasn't good.  

I hope they improve soon.  we love the lattes there, but being a bakery they need to have better quality pastries too!",2

We had the crab nachos, guacamole, and wedge salad. The nachos and guacamole were good, what you expect. The wedge salad however I felt had no mexican flavor at all and frankly was full of random herbs on top and 50 different types of seeds. I was expecting a delicious wedge salad but unfortunately it was too 'fancy' for me. Normally i am okay with the price I pay but for this particular restaurant I felt it was extremely pricey. Not to off put anyone though it was mexican food but without authenticity and instead a modern upscale flare, if that's what you're into check this place out.",2

For appetizers, we have had the street corn, poke, the make your own guacamole, and the chips and salsa. All were amazing! If you have room after the main course, the tres leches is awesome and is definitely worth a try. 

    For those who are of legal drinking age, the sangrias and margaritas are the bomb! Service is always good and they usually have a DJ playing music which is fabulous. It's a bit dark in the restaurant and the music is loud, but it sets almost a club-like atmosphere I personally do not mind. 

   We always make a reservation about two or so months in advance. Their reservations fill up fast. If you are a foodie, you will love this place.",2

Went to Haji Baba with my wife.  My wife and I got a kabab combination, order of foul, and an order of kibbeh.  It was good.  This is the standard Middle Eastern/Lebanese fare.  It is a place that you go for good food.  The restaurant is pretty casual.",2
900,3,1549843200000,"NOTE: I can't say I recognize any of the staff members in the photos that have been uploaded, but I will simply review my experience during the summer of 2014.

I walked in to the shop on weekday, seeing that it was clean, was moderately busy and was fairly well kept. The clerk at the desk was happy to make a booking for the following day. When I came back, the clerk greeted me warmly and asked me if I wanted a tea. She gave me a steaming mug of green tea, which was a pleasant way to start my visit.

During the weekdays, I could see that the majority of clients are older ladies. I could also see the staff work hard and everyone is always happily chatting with their clients. In between their clients, staff are also cleaning up and keeping the shop orderly. They were even professionally dressed and you could see that there was a dress code (business casual and black).

My hairdresser, Amy, was very considerate and washed my hair to start. She even asked me how I wanted my hair blown dry. I was unaware that there were different options, being someone who has liked my simple straight hair and never wanted anything different. She listened to my requests and gave me exactly what I wanted. She even gave me a helpful shopping tip for my sister's wedding!

I left a generous tip for my hairdresser and was also happy to pick up a bottle of KMS Silk Sheen (I'd lost my previous bottle). I'd go back if I wanted something fancier, although I feel $50 for a basic wash, cut and dry is fairly steep. I believe they focus on speciality cuts but are happy to receive a wide range of clients.",2

906,1,1550361600000,"If I had one word for this experience, it would be ""strange"". What a strange place, and a strange evening... That said, the food was delightful!

I live right around the corner from this place and have run past it so many times... we finally decided to give it a shot with some friends, looking for a quick dinner before taking them to the airport. When we parked, the place looked empty, but an ""open"" sign illuminated the front window. We gave it a shot and walked in, only to be greeted by an overwhelming ""WAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"" of what seemed like a contact alarm system on the door. A lady looked up, understandably startled, and we inquired as to whether they were open, since the place was empty, and we seemed to have set off an alarm. (It stops as soon as the door is closed.)

She informed us that they were indeed open, and told us to sit anywhere. We stepped out onto the patio where she came out to take our drink orders. She took quite a while getting them back to us, but we could hardly blame her, as she appeared to be the only one working there. We ordered some guac, which was heavy on the cilantro, but otherwise, very tasty! We began to worry a bit about the time, as we needed to get to the airport soon and had only JUST placed our orders... but since the waitress was in the kitchen cooking our orders, there was no one to whom we could express our haste. She returned a while later with all of our meals, which were (to her credit) piping hot, overwhelmingly fresh and DELICIOUS. I will ABSOLUTELY be back here again (when I have more time)! It was probably the best burrito I've ever had, and I remember being struck by the freshness of the ingredients - there was so little grease and it didn't feel runny... just really, really delicious. A few minutes after we wolfed down our food, we paid and continued on to the airport. Our friends made their flights (however closely) and we all agreed that the place had been totally worthwhile! 

This woman was fantastic - I couldn't believe she did it all herself! That said, there's no reason to have only ONE person in a restaurant. Maybe we were there at an awkward time... but at least the food was delicious!",2
908,1,1549497600000,"This is the my visit and first time staying here.  It's nice and clean.  Not a lot of traffic of people.  Rooms  are nice and roomie.  Why I gave them the lack of stars is we requested a roll away bed for our 4 yrs old and they said they can't because it's part of their policy. The room was big enough to accommodate one but they couldn't provide one.  This is the first time I've encountered this issue.  I can under stand if the room is too small.  All they could give us was a crib.  This is also the first hotel I've had less than 4 pillows on the bed.. Which is kinda odd.  I didn't really want to bother for another request since we were already denied for the roller bed. The ice machine on our floor kept running out of ice. My husband had to go on another floor to get ice.  Other than what I've listed, it's was a quiet stay.  I hope the hotel will fix these issues when and if the next time i would stay there again.",2

935,3,1549843200000,"I have had a lot of dental work in my 32 years of life. A lot of bad dental work, some good dental work. When I had pain in my nose cavity of course I was worried. I got 2 opinions from general dental offices regarding the pain and was told that I was going to possibly need my two front teeth pulled with implants. No way did I want implants. The 2nd dentist I saw referred me to this office to see what Dr. Christensen thought. 

The office is located on Sahara in a reddish building next to carmax. There is assigned parking right out front for dental patients which is nice. The dental office is warm and inviting. I was brought in with a small wait and had a CT/3D scan of my mouth and a series of x-rays. The technology is really amazing. I could see my whole jaw and teeth in 3D. Dr. Christensen reviewed the diagnostics and advised he could treat the area without taking out the teeth. Boy was I relieved. 

I went in a few weeks later to have two root canals redone and my mouth cut open to put in bone grafts. I took some sedation pills they gave and the 3 hour procedure literally felt like 15 min. Dr. Christensen and his assistant Stephanie really put me at ease. Anytime I felt pain, I would raise my hand and they would immediately put more anesthetic in my mouth. Dr. Christensen has a comforting way about him and low voice. I have been to other dentists that talk about random stuff when doing your teeth or chattering back and forth with their assistants (prob why I have so many dental problems). That was definitely not this dentist. 

Dr. Christensen called me the next day, which was a Saturday morning, to see how I was feeling. He advised me I would probably feel worse the next day, which I did. 

The follow up to get the stitches out went well and overall I am feeling good about it. We will continue to follow up to make sure my mouth is healing. 

I would definitely go back to this office or recommend this dentist.",2

usually get the beef combos and additional meats to share with a large group and they also give a bean paste stew and steamed egg which are both delicious. the meats are all really good - if I had to choose one, it would be the boneless short ribs

service is very friendly and they cook your meat for you. when it gets busy they don't come around as often, also wish they gave more refills on the corn cheese

interior is nicely done and well thought out - they incorporate pieces to give the space a Korean street style vibe and love that they play kpop music with music videos playing on the tvs

they also give free snack (popcorn/slush/etc) while you wait and they have mouthwash and toothbrushes in the bathrooms! Extra stars for execution and thoughtfulness of this restaurant",2
957,1,1550275200000,"Daaaaamn, SOHO, where have you been all my life? A family friend told me they have the best chicken & waffles in town, but I'd just never made it over to try them. On our six-month marker, my boyfriend surprised me with dinner here; because it was a Tuesday night, we were seated quickly, & though there were a few other tables filled, the ambiance was generally quiet & low-key.

We split the Jalapeno hushpuppies served with ""comeback sauce,"" which our served described as ""Probably a mix of mayo & ketchup?"" It was better than it sounds, I promise, & the hushpuppies were perfect - lightly spicy, very crispy, & not too dry, like hushpuppies sometimes are. We were also served a few pieces of fresh, hot bread with house-made seasoned butter & some kind of jam (I forget what kind) that I would've eaten with a spoon if it were an option.

Needless to say, we were carbed-up & happy by the time our meals arrived, but we'd left plenty of room for dinner. And good thing! My boyfriend ordered his fried chicken ""evenin' style,"" served with mashed potatoes, braised collards, & sausage gravy; I,. of course, ordered mine ""mornin' style,"" with a rosemary waffle & Ohio maple syrup. The other option, which I'd love to try, is ""late-night style,"" with pulled pork mac 'n' cheese, & smoked cherry bbq sauce. I KNOW, RIGHT? They're all served with boneless chicken - a breast & a thigh. I don't like dark meat, & getting it with all-white meat wasn't an option, so my boyfriend & I swapped - all-white for me, all-dark for him. A good trade, but I wish I could've just ordered it the way I wanted it.

That said, everything was delicious. The waffle was hot & soft, & the chicken was perfectly done, with the crispy coating so fresh that it was sliding off of the meat. I was too full to eat all of it, but I took one of the breasts home for leftovers the next day. Just as good afterward!

SOHO has a number of interesting-sounding items on their menu that I'd love to go back to try - but honestly, the mornin'-style chicken was so tasty that I don't know if I could bring myself to order anything else!

Minus one star for the very slow service, because only one server seemed to be working that night, & she was also playing hostess - crazy! Though she was very friendly & accomodating, the fact that she was flying solo meant the service was understandably under par. I'd still go back, but I hope they don't make a habit of being so understaffed.",2
963,3,1549929600000,"As much as I love cars, I'm surprised that I always drag my feet to maintain them... Don't get me wrong. I take the cars in for oil changes and services, but just behind schedule.

I've gone here for servicing and oil changes since I first got my Jeep Grand Cherokee last spring, and they've treated me quite well each time. There is a waiting room with a tv, and a fancy machine (no not that table top kind.... the tall machine that stands about 4 feet tall and looks like a giant coffee vending machine!) that dispenses Starbucks. You have a choice of two types of blends. There are also usually pastries and bagels with cream cheese on hand as well in case you haven't eaten anything yet when you wait for your car. Nice amenities, check!

My service guy is Travis, and he takes good care of me when I go there. He's honest whenever my car needs something changed and lets me know when the car is just fine. He's not pushy in anyway and always friendly whenever I'm there. If he is busy, usually someone else greets me when I drop the car off and checks to see if everything is okay or what my concerns are. Customer service good, check!

Prices for service? They are basically about average compared to other Jeep dealerships. I know, I know, you're going to tell me how people's wallets get, for lack of better words, raped whenever going to a dealership, but right now my Jeep is under warranty, so I'm going to go there for now. Moore Jeep always floods my emails with coupons or deals. Heck, there's even a Yelp discount for going to this dealership, so that always helps with lightening the bill.

The prices were mouth dropping, affordable pricing but such quality with the food. I had the burger, tuna burger, and poutine. When I lived in Canada all I did was sample poutine and 595's is very very authentic tasting. They just need to add more cheese curds and they'll be solid! The burger and tuna was cooked to upmost perfection. Weird that I paid 2$ for ONE slice of bacon on my burger though.

Drinks ordered Mother Earth beer, powderfinger and after the gold rush. The after the gold rush drink was disgusting and the server was so so nice to me and offered his own drink called the Trinidad sour. THANK YOU ERIC! He was literally psychic because I didn't complain about my drink and he knew i didn't like it. Eric gave me the best service I've ever received at a bar/restaurant.

974,2,1551312000000,"I remember Mad Greek being featured on Food Network some time ago, but I totally forgot about it on my recent trip to Vegas until my mom brought it up, except with her Chinese accent she pronounced it as ""mah greek."" Naturally, I was thrilled to finally try this place out. Mad Greek serves other classic favorites such as burgers and pastrami sandwiches besides their famed gyro. Apparently there are several Mad Greek locations all centralized near or around Las Vegas. Here's the dealio:

Have been here twice within a span of two days. I went to the one in Baker as well. The first time to check it out, and since I wasn't hungry enough for a gyro, I got a strawberry milkshake, a pistachio baklava, and a spanakopita to go (yes, definitely wasn't hungry). Here I was expecting to be knocked off my feet and my socks rocked the hell off by the shake ('cause apparently my mom has tried it before and loved it--she rarely likes food). It tasted...not really like a strawberry milkshake. The strawberry flavor was completely off and tasted very bland. Ok, way to mess up a strawberry shake.

The pistachio baklava was all right, but had way too much syrup in one layer, so you ended up with this effect of an imbalanced, overpowering sweetness as you chewed through the pastry. The spanakopita...well I have had much better back in the Bay.

The second time I came back I tried the gyro, and my mom ordered the chicken gyro. The fries were soggy and not crispy. The gyro meat, yogurt sauce and rice were all ridiculously overloaded with salt. Not sure how people could stand that level of sodium on their pallet. I wolfed it down despite the saltiness, my determination to finish it driven only by the price (10 bucks) I paid for it; the gyro was, in fact, a huge disappointment. I love gyros and have tried a number of them, but this one was definitely far off from being the ""Best Gyro in the USA."" The chicken gyro was actually quite tasty and less salty.

As the juicy cherry on top of my whole experience here, the prices were ridiculously pricey. Almost 5 bucks for a shake; 10 bucks for the gyro and rice or fries, 4 bucks for a fruit cup that didn't even taste fresh or sweet, etc.

Extra star for the interesting decor and funny ass signs posted around the place.

Service was excellent. Attentive and friendly without being overly so. Our calamari app was lightly dusted and delicious. The tomato/mozz caprese was good although the tomatoes were a little flavorless, odd in Ohio in August. 

Two of us had the farmer's pasta which was terrific. The grilled vegetables added a smokiness to the dish. The fettucine fresh and perfectly cooked and the light wine sauce pulled the elements together nicely. The portion itself looked a bit small in the bowl but turned out to be the perfect serving size. The lobster roll got a good review from one in our party and the salmon ordered by the other person in our party got a thumbs up between mouthfuls. We finished our meal with the warm peach, caramel tart with vanilla ice cream and practically fought over the last bites.

The Thai Iced tea was yummy! The bathroom was clean and sanitary. T

What could improve

The atmosphere is nice and the music was good. They have a lot of TVs so I think it might be a nice place to catch a game.",2

Popped in here after perusing their butcher shop that's located just a block away and decided we needed to try something. Had the burger and couple glasses of wine...it was one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life: Canada AA rated American beef, cooked to perfection with amazing texture and construction. Staff very friendly and hospitable (minus the host, he was actually quite rude when we walked in at 5:30...the place was empty but he considered not seating us due to the incoming evening reservations - eventually he let us sit at the bar but said, ""you need to be gone by 7:30""). Very cool space as well.

1047,3,1551052800000,"2nd highest rated restaurant on Yelp?  Is this a joke?  This place gets 3.5 Stars from me, which I hope will help drive down the ridiculous rating!  Here's why it gets 3.5:

+++PROS+++
1. For the type of food, the prices are good
2. The service is excellent.  They handled our group of 20 or so Yelpers as smoothly as they could have.
3. Lots on the menu, plenty of options for all, even those annoying vegetarian friends.

---CONS---
1. If you're going to call yourself a ""Really Really Nice Restaurant"", you may want to invest in things like, paint on the walls, a janitor to clean your bathroom, etc.
2. The most important thing, the food, simply wasn't that great.  Just good, not really or really really good.  I had the scallops+pork belly, gnocchi, and lamb chops.  The gnocchi was the best of the bunch. 

To be perfectly honest, there's too many good restaurants in Toronto for Gio Rana's to be a destination location for me.  The high Yelp rating and great expectations don't help either.  Overall, I liked it and would return, it is just not up to the rating or hype, and not in an area I would go out of my way to have a meal.",2
1053,1,1550880000000,"Recently my husband and I with friends decided to try Giada's. What a disappointment. There were very few people in the restaurant and we were seated right away. Our waitress finally came and asked for our drink order. It took nearly 20 minutes before they finally came. She then took our dinner order. Nearly45 minutes later our dinner arrived. My husband had ordered spaghetti and meatballs and the spaghetti was overdone and barely warm. I had ordered the meatballs as had our friend. I had the white sauce and my friend had the marinara. Our meatballs were more meal than meat and were barely warm. I called the waitress over and sent them back. When she brought them back she said to be careful the plate was very hot. The plate was indeed very hot, but my meatballs were not any warmer than when she brought them the first time. I'm not sure how the plate got so hot and the meatballs and sauce were still so cool that the sauce had a ""skin"" over the top of it. No one ever came to clear the table. We had to request our bill and ended up getting up to find out where we should go to pay. To sum it up....the service was poor, the food was below par and sadly we will not be returning.",3

Overall, the experince I had here was fantastic!  This is for locals and they did not have all the fluff for the out of town visitors that some of the other shooting ranges have.

Talked with Management over four times during a twelve week period of time and no action has been taken to resolve conditions(2013).  Mission statement implies that their motto is for remembering a life with dignity.  I believe dignity supports fixing problem areas.  The original vases for our parents have been missing for years.

One visit I had the ham croissant breakfast sandwich which melted in my mouth - so good. The other time I had a quiche and it was cooked light and season well. Also had the fruit tart which is the best I've tasted in town! Perfect crust, fresh fruit and not too sweet.

Very good drinks that include a nice selection of wine to a martini with dry ice so it bubbles. The best thing about the filet was the nicely charred crust and that it was on a 400 degree plate so that every bite was as good as the first. The baked potato was good not great. Duke is a great server who can help you enjoy your time there. The only reason I didn't give it 5 star is because i have had better Good less money.,1

We got double of things we ordered, and were missing some other items.

Food-wise, the beef short ribs (kalbi beef) was good. Very juicy and tender (and fatty). The salmon sashimi were large, thin slices but were falling apart. It tasted fine, and was really soft. The maki were less impressive and were poorly presented. The filling to rice ratio was good, but most of the black dragon roll was missing the unagi (eel) top! How they could forget to put the unagi on the rest of the roll, I'll never understand. The ends of the roll were uneven and looked rushed. The spicy salmon sushi had an okay-level of spiciness. The wasabi came in a pool of water. 

Free parking (plaza) and cheap $21.95 dinner price on weekdays. They speak Mandarin and English.

Overall, it was average and good enough if I'm in the area because of it's low price.",2

Remind me to never ever again get a tuna sub from this place. It was like eating slimy cat food on a tasteless roll. 

Bad on me for even attempting this. As I do not eat red meat anymore I needed something to have for dinner on the long flight back to NYC and tuna seemed like a decent enough choice. Service was pleasant and quick enough. Basic airport prices.

I ate basically half of the sandwich and wanted to hurl. Left the other half under my seat on the plane. I bet that was a fun surprise for the cleaning crew!

For under $10 you can get multiple sandwiches which come with a very fresh salad with collard greens, peppers, and baby corn sprinkled in - very refreshing when a complimentary side salad is more than green lettuce from a grocery store. The baguette was fine for my ham and cheese sandwich but wasn't the best in town. Still, a nice option for lunch in the area. They have an outdoor seating area as well as a half dozen tables inside.

I am only giving one star because I like the out side dining. long story short...... from the beginning the hostesses acted like we where inconvenience by coming in to the restaurant. we had three adults and two kids and asked to sit outside. The young hostesses acted put out then grabbed one kids menu and our adult menus and walked off so we fallowed, no please fallow me or right this way,  just walked us out tossed our menus on the table and walked off. sticking the high chair at the end of the table by the swing door that the servers fly in and out of. let me tell you how nice that made dining. Then we did finally get a waiter and asked for crayons for the kids that the hostess forgot, The waiter was nice seemed a bit lost but nice, we ordered and there started the long wait finally getting our food thinking it would be hot because the plates were but the food was luke warm and all our food had not flavor. The fish was bland and my sister got the fried cat fish and it was soaked in grease, my king platter was horrible I couldn't even eat it, the sides where cold and again no flavor!

1137,3,1550966400000,"Recently my friend told us to try Paramount and little did we know, they were opening one closer to home. They just opened their Erin Mills location on November 15th.

We decided to try it out last night. Boy, was it busy! Driving by, you can already see the crowd waiting inside (thankfully there's a decently sized indoor waiting area). I thought they were joking when I was told it would be about 10 minutes...and I still think they were (just to keep us around). We ended up waiting 15 minutes, so it wasn't a bad estimate.

We were told to check out the menu, then order and pay at the counter. We returned back to our table and were given fresh pitas that were warm and puffy, which we enjoyed until it cooled down. It took 15 minutes for our food to arrive at our table, which was not bad considering how busy it was.

We wanted to try a bit of everything, so we ordered a plate of Chicken & Beef Shawarma and a plate of Mixed Grill. It was an incredible amount of food for two people, but it can definitely feed up to four. Each plate came with a lot of plain white rice (the other option was fries), some pickles, a little bit of lettuce and tomatoes, and delicious garlic sauce (don't forget to bring a pack of gum!). Out of all the meats, my favourite was the shish tawouk. The marinated chicken was very juicy and it was cooked perfectly. (The shish tawouk plate is something I will definitely order next time!) The BBQ beef was nice and juicy, slightly but not overly chewy. I'm not a big fan of kafta, but the kafta was not bad. Considering it is a Middle Eastern / Arabic restaurant, I was expecting the shawarma to be one of the top reasons I would dine here again. However, I was pretty disappointed with the shawarma meats because they were both dry. The temperature and the texture of the meats tasted like either the plate itself or the meats had been sitting in the kitchen for a long time. 

The staff were all very friendly and quick at everything they do as they were trying to clear the tables as soon as possible. I thought the restaurant was a bit noisy, somewhat similar to a bar and grill with a lot of chatter plus the clinking of cutlery and plates.

All in all, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is even just slightly interested in Middle Eastern / Arabic cuisine. It's a nice, friendly environment, the portions are big, and the shish tawouk is great!

One more thing... Our friend also told us ""one cannot leave without having their baklawa"". I have never been a fan (maybe because I've never had well-made baklawas), but we still decided to try their entire assortment. The first one I tried was the cashew-filled baklawa and it just melted in my mouth... It was a tiny bit too sweet, but so delicious. Our friend was right. I'm not sure I will ever step out of there and not have a bite of their baklawa before I leave!",2

1158,1,1549929600000,"I found this place on yelp in the search for okonomiyaki in Markham and stumbled upon the okonomiyaki fries. The fries, first of all, are huge and should be shared between 2-4 people. Being sort of an okonomiyaki snob, the toppings and presentation were true to the okonomiyaki name, but for some reason, they salted the fries. This made it too strong. There's no reason to add salt because of the already salty kewpie, okonimiyaki sauce, katsuobushi. Still a great dish, but I feel like leaving out the salt and also adding bacon bits would make it a winner.

Also tried the azuki cream smoothie. If you like red bean, you'll love this. Naturally sweet with a strong red bean taste.

I might come back to try other dishes. The menu is pricey, and I'm not big on pasta, but sometimes you want a little quality, presentation, and a relaxing atmosphere when eating, and you don't find that often in Markham.",2

The regular cocktail menu is more interesting, but I got the side step. It was pretty well balanced but wasn't amazing. 

I went with the sliders, which were juicy, and they came with a good amount of fries. With the 64th floor view, it was a good value.

Walked in here and was immediately greeted. I asked for a table, I was told to pick wherever I wanted to sit, so I picked a booth. When I first slid into it, the booth felt a bit sticky. The sort of stickiness you get from when you have grease sit over time if you don't clean it up. I instantly felt turned off, thinking the establishment was already dirty. I then noticed the floors which were a light grey carpet color. Not sure that was a bright idea for the amount of traffic you would be getting for a restaurant, but it looked stained and dirty. I thought to myself, if they don't clean their seats and floors....then they sure won't be cleaning the kitchen either. I brushed off the thought, but I immediately felt grossed out when I saw a waiter serve a food of plate to a couple of guests while wearing a blue glove then went to wipe some things down with a dirty rag then served up another dish while wearing the same glove. I wanted to leave at that point but I had already placed my order in. 

My fiancé got bacon and eggs, while I got the country fried steak. The bacon was burnt and so were the eggs, it had an after taste from the grill that tasted burnt. The country fried steak was all right, it was made pretty thick with breading. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.

I think this place was ok for what it is, $10 for bacon & eggs seemed kinda pricey. I'd say this place was a one and done stop for me.",2

1190,2,1549152000000,"This is a review of the service we received, not the food.  At a fine dining restaurant, part of the experience is the excellent service one comes to expect. Apparently it was missing here. We had a reservation for two and we were promptly seated. However, we were seated next to another table for two in which the guy at the table decided to do the romantic thing and instead of sitting directly across from his date, he pulled his chair to her side.  Which meant that as soon as we sat down, he was looking straight at us. It just wasn't comfortable and in a fine dining restaurant where seating is tight, the staff shouldn't have allowed this couple to do that. 
 
The service got worst. Our waiter kept paying attention to this couple and never really served us. He never introduced himself by giving us his name nor tell us what the special of the night were. When this couple finally left, we thought we were going to get better service. DREAM ON!  They seated another couple, which was fine, but this couple  was immediately given their bread and that's when we realized we never got our bread. In fact, we had to ask our waiter if there was any reason why we didn't get any bread.  (We actually got our appetizers before we got the bread.). By the time the bread came, our entrees were also ready. 

Throughout the meal, the waiter came a few times to pour us water and that was basically the extent of his service.  Even then, when we asked for a second bottle of sparkling water, it never came until we asked for it again. Not once did he ask us if we enjoyed our meal. He barely spoke to us. He seemed like he didn't want to be there. 

This was also my birthday dinner and the experience almost ruined my birthday. Needless to say, we couldn't wait to finish our meals and get the hell out. We almost felt like tipping our waiter just one penny to show our dissatisfaction. If anything, our waiter merely took up space.

This is not the type of service one gets treated to at a fine dining place like Bobby Flay's restaurant.  Compared to the excellent service I got the night before at Emeril Lagasse's Table 10, the service here was lacking and almost non-existing.",1

1208,3,1551052800000,"I usually go to Regal Cleaner on 7th Avenue & Missouri because it's a flat $2.25 for any item you bring in, and I like cheap. But I work in north Scottsdale and figured I would try to get an errand done on my lunch break and brought my dry cleaning to Delia's. They had a 35% coupon online, so I figured it wouldn't be that much more than Regal. Wrong.

For two blazers, one skirt, and one top it was $20 with the 35% off coupon. Maybe that's cheap to people in DC Ranch, but for the same price, I could have gone to Regal and had two drinks at happy hour at Windsor on the way home. What's worse is the quality wasn't even that great. One of my blazers had some weird creases, and they hung my skirt by safety pinning it onto a shirt hanger. I guess the cutting-edge technology of skirt hangers hasn't made it up to NorSco yet.",2
1211,1,1550016000000,"Névé stands out from the many other cafés on the Plateau by focussing on serving carefully prepared high quality coffee.  They serve coffee made from 49th Parallel beans (which can also be purchased to brew at home). There are also cookies, patisseries and sandwiches available, although while reasonably tasty, these don't represent quite as good value as the coffee.  

The interior seating is a mix of shared tables and benches, intriguing-yet-precarious bar stools fashioned from bicycle parts, in addition to a couple of comfortable couches.  The couches are bathed in sunshine on sunny days, and provide a perfect vantage point for people watching.  Névé's clientele reflects the neighbourhood, relatively young and trendy.  There is free wireless internet available, and it appears to be a popular local café for laptop users.    

Basically the draw at Névé is the coffee.  Besides that, it's a pleasant spot on the Plateau, like others in the neighbourhood.",1

It's family run (by a great family),you build your sandwiches with a highlighter, it's hard to ignore the deserts (the cream cheese ginger cookie...

1225,2,1550275200000,"ShowStoppers targets an older crowd. Look, I love musicals and I've seen dozens but the ""show stopper"" tunes that were selected for this production are from old-school shows like Chicago, Caberet, Annie Get Your Gun. Don't expect to see songs from Wicked, The Book of Mormon, Lion King, or any contemporary musicals.

We had just arrived in Las Vegas an hour before the show and I was going to use this as an opportunity to nap (the tickets were ""free"" in the hotel package I booked). The theater was really high tech - great lighting, fancy curtains (seriously check these out), and beautiful sets. All of the performers were extremely talented and kept me awake during the entire show. My favorite performance was You're the One that I Want from Grease.

The lead female singer has an incredible voice and stage presence. She was the Show Stopper!

That said, if you're in Las Vegas, there are much more interesting shows you can see. I'd recommend Le Reve at the adjacent Wynn Theater if you haven't seen that yet.",3

I enjoyed the list they have available for dietary needs such as vegan! The list was very helpful! Also the way the labeled everything was truly helpful! Since it was my first time there they provide me with a free Trader Joe's reusable bag- which I already used to return some library books. While I was checking out the cashier also informed me of some products I should try my next visit and how the manager at the store has been vegan for years!

1236,3,1549152000000,"Thailicious?  For sure!  Took the wife out here with the intention of ordering way too much & taking some home. Mission accomplished. 

First, the crab with cream cheese puff pastries. Nice balance of the stuffed crab & cream cheese. The sweet sauce on the side added tremendous value.  Our chicken Tom Ka Gai soup was exactly the way I like it.  Perfect amount of coconut flavor, mushrooms & some green herbs, and served at a temperature ready to eat.

Next, entrees...I always try the Pad Thai at new spots. This one looked great & tasted better. Went with shrimp, which was seasoned just right & the soft noodles cooked to perfection.  

Last, but definitely not least, the Green Curry.  I love curry & this is my new favorite.  Layers of flavors with a subtle heat that built as I ate more. Liked it so much that we ordered another with an Avacado Curry to go.  Sooooo yummy.

Finished off with the vegan cheesecake.  Never had a vegan cheesecake & gotta say, it was tasty.  Non dairy whipped cream on top, with some fruit and chocolate sauce.  Perfect sweet ending.

The portion sizes are on the larger side, and the flavors are spot on.  There were extra peppers and spices brought to the table to further season to taste, if need be.  Really though, it wasn't needed. Highly recommend enjoying some meals at this comfy spot.",2

Came at lunchtime and we were seated right away.  Our server was nice but was sooo soft spoken it was hard to hear him.  I went with the meat and 3 and did the fried chicken with mac & cheese, creamed corn and sweet potatos.  It was all good but not great.  I prefer the style of the sides at Rooster's and the creamed corn wasn't really creamed.  The corn bread was awesome though.  I did have to ask about them because our server never brought them over till long after our food arrived.

My aunt did get a run down of the restaurants mission statement from our server and overall they seemed to really enjoy themselves.  I was treated so can't comment on price, but didn't seem very expensive.",2

My first impression was how hot it was inside as it seems they didn't have any air conditioning on. All the fans were going which gave it at least some air flow but all of us were sweating and fanning ourselves with the menu. We were sitting right by the door and asked if they could close it since the hot air was blowing in. They closed it, but then eventually opening the other side. Ok...

We ordered the spinach dip, volcano nachos, boneless buffalo wings, and the chicken fajitas. I could have had better food reheated from Applebee's. The food quality is very low and obviously is just reheated from a package. Not worth the money at all. 

The manager on duty was apparently stressed out because at one point she was screaming at someone on her radio to get another server to the patio. All the guests were looking at her.

Good cocaine, hobos sleeping on the sidewalk outside Bellagio, and racist Pokemon card dealers. Life is cray on The Strip.

That said, the strip is also an incredibly cool place to walk. Endless sights and all sorts of characters everywhere you look. I was lucky enough to walk the strip on a cool winter's night. The lights were all lit up and the brisk night air was alive with that Vegas atmosphere. It was absolutely one of the most memorable experiences of my life, thus far. Nothing that I have experienced is even close to how awesome it was on the strip. And I didn't even walk the whole thing!

Though there were a lot of families out, walking the strip, it's not really someplace that I would take my kids (same goes for Vegas in general, to be honest), due to all of the aforementioned (not so PG) colorful characters. Of course, if you do, it's certainly something that they're bound to remember. Just don't let them get their hands on any of those ""Pokemon"" cards that they hand out there.

All in all, walking the strip will always be one of the standout memories of my time in Vegas. Whether you're in Vegas for business or pleasure, I'd make it a point to get out and walk the strip at least once.

On a side note, it really helps to share pockets on those chilly winter nights! That was one of my favorite parts of walking the strip!",2

Normally I like spicy food (and so does my eldest son) but since we wanted to share with my youngest and my wife we only asked for a spice level of 3 (on the 1-10 scale the waiter told us) - but both the Lamb Curry and Shrimp Saag were too spicy to eat! I can't recall paying $14.99 for a small entrée and then leaving 80% on the plate (and no one wanted a to-go container on it). My youngest ordered Chicken Biryani with the least spice possible (1 on a 1-10 scale) and it was too spicy for 3 of 4 diners to eat. The waiter was good - and he put in the orders correctly, as the receipt reflects the correct spice levels - but the cook made every entrée radically spicy. If they said up front ""every meal is super spicy"" that would be one thing, but to pretend that you can tailor the spice level and then serve the spiciest rice I have ever had (when the customer ordered the lowest) doesn't work. Also a bit pricy - $15 entrée does not include even steamed rice (extra $4). So in the end it was more expensive than other Indian food here in Las Vegas, and less edible.

I was told by the sales guy that the delivery time is around 4 to 5 weeks. In the 6th week, hearing nothing about the ordered item, I made a call to the store. They told me it will take at least another 5 weeks with no warranty! The sales guy rudely tough me how to read the fine print in the invoice telling a custom order is non-cancellable and does not have delivery date guaranteed. There was nothing custom in my sofa other than the color we chose! This was another trick they get you into a sh*ty contract. The guy told me the manufacturer may have some delay for materials delivery from China. He may have told another lie now about the material delivery or then about their stuffs are all Canadian. I have read now from tons of people having the same problem with Chesterfield furniture. Again, DO NOT BY ANYTHING FROM THIS STORE! The sales guy was Randy Dorsey.",2
1467,3,1550707200000,Good place. I had the bacon cheeseburger with bacon.  Ordered the onion rings instead of the fries and that was the right choice. Nice staff. Burgers were good quality and they deep fry the bacon so it is delicious and crispy.,2
1473,3,1550620800000,"I just don't understand the Pinkberry hype. My husband and I were tempted by the Salted Caramel yogurt. While it was tasty, I was just not wowed by the selection of toppings or the price. I just know what I like. We were told we could have ""unlimited toppings."" Well, as luck would have it I chose these delicious looking milk chocolate crispies. The lady serving said they were $.50. So they essentially do not have unlimited toppings. I just prefer the self-serve method of yogurt where toppings are indeed unlimited and you can get as much or as little as you want.",2
1483,1,1550880000000,"The customer service was great. However, the food was meh. I only liked 2 of the sauces which is the biggest part of fondue. I ordered the signature which came with chicken, beef, & shrimp. I had the oil to cook in which came with 2 types of tempura. I was not crazy about either one. Most of it got burned in the oil and stuck to my cooking utensil. The best part for me was stuffing the mushrooms with green goddess sauce & frying them at the waitresses suggestion. Other than that all the meats were pretty bland.

I had the Wisconsin cheese fondue. There was something about the smell & the consistency that I found off putting. Even now I can smell it & it's not a good thing. It was way too mushy for me & I wish now I would hv sent it back. 

Desert was okay. I can't remember the kind of chocolate but it was lit on fire at the table. That was pretty cool. It had some type of nut in it. It was difficult to pick up the nuts and the different sweets on the dipping utensil at the same time. Just imagine picking up nuts with a tiny 2 prong fork. I just ended up dipping the treats & eating the nuts after with an actual fork.

The decor is very nice but that's not that important to me. For me, it's about the food. I've had some great food from some hole in the wall spots but for the cost of the food here I expected lots more.  

The chocolate martini was delicious. Other than that, I'm glad I experienced it but I'm not in any hurry to go back.",2
1494,3,1549497600000,"The result of a $100 priceline gamble. Called in for a free upgrade to a suite and a late check out at 4 PM!!!! Is that even a real check out time?

The rooms were beautiful, with a great view of Las Vegas. The beds and couches were comfortable and the hotel service was top notch. The bathroom had a TV embedded into the mirror. Two facet showers, tubs, flat screens in every room. 2 complimentary bottles of water and free wifi.

Bar downstairs turned out weak drinks. Crystal and gold plated everything in the hotel lobby. Shuttles to Ceasar's palace and the Wynn. Slow valet.

Their pizza via room service was delicious, though we were all starving.

For the bang for your buck, this place is legit. The average cab cost to PH/City Center is $12-14.

1512,2,1548979200000,"We have a two story, 2000sq home, that was in bad need of some TLC. Crash of rhinos was just what the HOA ordered lol. Our stucco was peeling, the paint was faded and lackluster, the fascias were multicolored, and the pop outs where the same drag color. We got several quotes, and though Mikes was not the lowest, it was very close. Mike stood out however for his professionalism and friendly demeanor, as well as his knowledge about what was going on with the house. He was also the only one who was honest to us in regards to the particle board that make up the underside of the patio. 
The 7 year warranty was also a great selling point, as was the paint concierge service mikes wife Kim offers. Not having to submit every paint scheme to the HOA and not having to research the dozens of different colors was well worth the extra $125! They were the only ones who offered this fabulously little extra perk and I couldn't recommend the concierge more. 

The wait time until they had a open slot was longer than we hoped for, but that's just because they do the job right. They power washed the house twice, and repaired the peeling stucco first. After allowing it to cure they finally painted our house, the exterior fence and fascias. The job was done well and in a timely manner by guys who were friendly and professional. They missed one small spot, but upon mentioning it to the painter guys they immediately corrected it with no fuss. Everything else was do e to expectations and came out looking great. So much so that our neighbors hired them as well. 

Thank you for a job well done.

Definitely the exterior painters of choice for Phoenix in my opinion.",2

This is basically a very high quality mom & pop restaurant, frequented mostly by locals.  ""Mom"" has always been there whenever we have come in.  The menu is diverse and the food is just a great.  This is not ""diner"" food, but food that someone takes pride in making.  I love the house salad (it's hard to make stand out salad, but this one does) and the filet mignon tips.  Awesome.

Prior to stepping foot in this establishment, I always wondered how Kirei stayed open because it always looked dark and empty inside during dinner time! I must admit that the darkness in fact kept me away from trying them for a while... but I've gotten over my skepticism and dined there a few times since. Kirei might not be my top choice but I would not unfriend you if you suggested to go there. The self-confessed sushi snob in me of course frowns because they are not authentic Japanese, but hey, I've finally started to accept that I live in Toronto and not Vancouver or Japan! This is adaptation at work, guys, check it.

They have a daily special consisting of some kind of drink/roll/sushi. I can't give you the whole range because it so happens that everytime I go in it is a drink + salmon sushi/sashimi for $6. Not bad! Servers are friendly and attentive. Food comes up at a decent pace. I don't think it's an especially inexpensive place to dine but I think that comes with the territory of edging the financial district and St Lawrence Market.

And yes, sometimes we get so lazy that we do order takeout from them as well (party tray take out date night for two... whaaaattt!!! don't judge). Fish quality is alright, the assortment is nice, price is fair, and they are quick. I would recommend that the next time one of you folks dropped the ball on your turn to cook and want to not be in the dog house ;)

1597,1,1548979200000,"Being new to the Phoenix area we were looking forward to finding a Thai restaurant, since we eat Thai fairly often. Going off of the Yelp reviews, we decided to try Swaddee. We ordered the Tom Ka soup with tofu instead of chicken, and the Pad See-ew with soft tofu, and the veggie rolls (to go). The veggie rolls were tasty and larger than we're used to, which was a nice surprise. The Tom Ka soup was a little more sour than we're used to, but overall still tasty. However, it was almost $11 which we felt was about double what it should have cost. The Pad See-ew was the most disappointing part of the meal. The flavor was fine, nothing special but not bad. However, it was pretty dry and sticky, like you'd expect from a cheap college Thai take-out joint.

Overall nothing really stood out. We had high hopes since the meals were on the pricey end for take-out, but we've had far better Thai for half the price. We'll keep looking for a better Thai place to become our local go-to!",1

If you join their mailing list, you get some pretty great coupons too. You don't need a lot of money to shop here which is awesome because for me, going to an art supply store is like a kid (or myself!) in a candy shop

1618,1,1551312000000,"I heard about Hair Happiness as I was searching for Japanese salons in Toronto. Indeed after reading reviews on Yelp, decided to give it a shot! Overall, amazing. My stylist was Rie, who has worked in Tokyo salons before. I requested for Rie after seeing ""before/after"" photos on Hair Happiness Instagram page and really liked her cuts. Hence decided to trust my (waist-length) hair with her!

Parked for free at Finch and walked up the tiny little stairs on the 2nd floor (above a pub). Rie greeted me with a cheerful smile and asked to take my coat. Explained my hair situation to her and what style I was looking for; particularly, long voluminous layers. She was very confident and seemed to understand exactly what I needed. After shampoo/massage (although quite short-lived), Rie diligently sectioned my hair and started snipping the ends with scissors. I haven't trimmed my hair in nearly a year, hence leaving a lot of split ends; so I appreciated how she scissored everything very carefully.

While she was drying my hair, she would offer me tips on how to style my bangs, dry my hair, add volume, etc. Another staff member helped her dry my hair since I was the only customer there at the time... felt nice to have two people drying my hair for me. After drying my hair, she went back to trim my hair in more detail.

Pretty pricey compared to other Asian salons, but given the careful trimming by Rie, I would definitely go back - but maybe skipping the shampoo/massage bit and save myself $15.",2

Most know that I eat steak unlike many others that live on this planet. I'm not only honored but extremely happy that as of yet this steak was the best steak that I have ever had so far.
As chef Jean-Georges mentioned on a commercial for the steakhouse in my Bellagio suite, every decent Chef can cook a steak, but what complements it are it's sauces or condiments. Many will agree with this, and few will disagree. But those who know where to get great cuts of meat, aged to perfection, know that salt-and-pepper and a good grill will always equal to a good and some even say a great steak. But what put this steak over the top, was the chef's recommendation to try his house sauce. I am not talking about some sort of steak sauce/barbecue sauce. I am talking about his signature steak sauce or juice as some may describe. Along with trying this steak with the other three common sauces normally used on steaks, his shined through with brilliance.
Accompanied with a very well matched and seasoned subtle mashed Yukon Gold potatoes and a Caesar salad that I will never forget. This made for, if not the best but, one of the best meals I have ever had in my lifetime so far.",2

1695,3,1550188800000,"probably my favorite place that i have stayed at in vegas so far (i have stayed at the signature at MGM, Riviera, Venetian, and MGM Grand).  The rooms are pretty big, we got the 2 bedroom suite which was just the king studio suite attached to a 1 bedroom suite by the doors that you can open to connect the rooms.  i feel if we would have gotten a corner room it would have been different and better, but this room still worked out perfectly fine.  we had 8 people, so there was enough sleeping room for everyone easy with their being the 2 king beds and the 2 queen pullouts.  I will say though, the sofa itself seemed a lot more comfortable than the queen pullouts, and 2 of my friends who were in the room agreed to it also.  

the smaller room (king studio) is smaller with just the king, a queen pullout, and then a typical hotel bathroom, a small kitchen with dishwasher, mini fridge, and microwave and then floor to ceiling windows and a TV.  

the living room of the 1 bedroom suite was very nice with the full kitchen (however you do not get pans to cook stuff unless you own the room?  wtf?!  i feel sorry for the guy downstairs cause i gave him an earful when they told us that when we wanted to cook bacon).  it has a very nice granite/marble table that is perfect for beer pong, however that table is really hard to move cause it weighs a ton.  then there is the huge L shaped sofa which has a queen pullout, 2 TV's, and the projector that goes against the shades when they are down.  I will say though, the ice maker in the freezer of the room is very slow.

the main king bedroom is attached to it's own bathroom and then to the living room.  that bedroom has a king bed, and some weird recliner thing that i was extremely comfortable along with its own TV and then the jacuzzi tub right next to the bed.  then you go into the bathroom which has toilet, shower, sinks.

overall, the 1 bedroom suite part is very roomy, the king studio is a little cramped, but the rooms were really nice, layout was good, amenities were nice.  the projector made it really nice for watching football since it was a little too cold for the pool

parking was not a problem at all, we just parked in the general parking.  go to level 3 of the structure because then you can walk right into the lobby of the westgate towers without having to go through the miracle mile shops and it makes it easy

check in is not supposed to be until 4pm, but we ended up getting in at 3:30am on friday and were not supposed to check in until later.  we went to the front desk to see if we could check in early but they said not at the moment but to check back at 6am and they would see.  we came back at 6am and they said we could get our reserved 2 bedroom suite if we wanted which we did, but they also gave us the option of waiting until 11am at the earliest to upgrade to a higher floor for $11 a night, or a penthouse for $100 a night, but some people in our group were dead tired so we just took our normal room.  i will probably take advantage of those options next trip though.  Valet was not there to have bell hops take our bags up at that time in the morning though which was a bummer because we had a ton of booze and other bags to take up, but it took us maybe 3 trips so it wasn't too bad


overall, i would absolutely stay here again in the future as the rooms were huge, prices weren't bad, staff was nice, location on the strip is pretty good too.  only things i didn't like were the supposed cooking utensils only for owners, and having to show your key everytime you want to go to your room. but i guess that is becoming the new thing as many hotels in vegas do that",2

Not too sweet.",2

The shooting games are fun and competition between friends and family is always a great time. The scenarios are pretty real and with the upgrade you can get a feel for what police have to decide on in their everyday job. The drinks are average food is better then typical bar food but still not a restaurant.,1

It's super reasonably priced for the beef sate and bbq chicken meals (what we normally get). It's only $7.95! 

Their lunch special menu is front and back, so there's many options. I definitely recommend this place.",2

Yes you are officially a Roberts taco shop addict like me :-) anyways if You are in the area and want a quality Roberts to visit this is your place! My only thing is that these particular items on the menu have went up and they will definitely nickel and dime you for all of the normal things that should come on a burrito or whatever else such as sour cream, guacamole, cheese etc!

The bartender did an amazing job, she was spot on with our cocktails.  Frequenting bars around the area, I have not found a better mojito any where else.  A definite must have!  The Cosmo was not too shabby either.  Add this place to your late stops for a quick dessert before heading home.  (Secret they don't encourage changes to the food, but if you ask nicely, they will do custom orders)  Don't walk run to humble!  Perfect for late night dates!",2

The food is so so.  But not very expensive during the half price appetizers special.  

A good place to meet up with friends when we live in various parts of the GTA.  Off the highways makes this an excellent spot.",2
1774,2,1550534400000,"I LOVE this place. It's a great little Mexican restaurant on Notre-Dame Street, ideal for lunch. To start, I've ordered the flautas (chicken or potato), which are served with queso fresco, red onions, radishes and lettuce as garnish. It's two per order and they are crunchy perfection!

Their speciality is the torta (a Mexican-style sandwich). I've tried the chicken, the steak and the vegetarian tortas. Surprisingly, my favourite is the ""Malinche"" vegetarian torta becauce the smoked mozzarella cheese pairs perfectly with the chipotle mayo, avocado, tomato slices and watercress. YUM. Each sandwich costs $10.95 before taxes. It's not cheap but I really enjoy it and find it very filling.

Do not overlook that jar placed on every picnic table. It's filled with homemade, pickled jalapeños, which are a delicious addition to the tortas or quesadillas and bursting with flavour.

I've also visited for breakfast on a Saturday - I thoroughly enjoyed it! Packed with flavour, my vegetarian breakfast quesadilla was delicious. Guacamole, pico de gallo, eggs and smoked cheese - what a winning combination! Their coffee is also amazing.

They also serve churros as a dessert option, which are delicious deep fried pastry rolled in cinnamon sugar. I love that they are constantly adding to their menu and changing up the decor of the restaurant.",2

Keep on going J.C, you are so so good for the body.",2
1795,2,1549411200000,"I will admit that I overlook things frequently, thus my mistake of constantly calling this delightful food truck ""Torched Goddess"". By either name, this has got to be the best mobile dessert truck ever. 

We originally had the Sea Salted Caramel and Pistachio on a Food Truck Friday downtown and were instantly hooked. The treats come in regular and small sizes - $4 and $2 respectively. Great price for how delicious and how much crème brulee you get. Upon placing your order, Chef Eric busts out his torch and caramelizes your treat right before your eyes. The top, my favorite part, is crunchy and delicious. The custard is smooth and a taste explosion in your mouth. You want to cry when it's gone, but luckily Eric is there to torch another treat for you. 

They've got over 30 rotating flavors, so we've also tried the Vanilla and Raspberry - both amazing. However, the Raspberry was a little overwhelming with a very strong berry taste. Also recently had the Coconut and you know my addiction to coconut... I was not disappointed! Coconut has to be my FAVORITE crème brulee flavor EVER. Husband agreed and tried to steal my precious away from me. Luckily, Torched Goodness locations can be found easily via their website or you can order online for delivery/pickup.",2

I had to tell the order taker my order a few times. And the person who brings out the food threw away my receipts so I made him dig them out the trash because he just assumed that I didn't want them. The food was hot. They didn't give me enough ketchup packets for my onion rings though. Typical fast food place with areas they can improve in with appropriate feedback.",3

Lobby looks great and the casino floor is fine.  i had a nice person at the reservation desk but my brother had a different experience with the female at the reserverations desk.  She was quite rude and not friendly all .  My brother told her that he didn't want to stay at the North Tower and she didn't listen to him.  My husband butt in and told her so she listen this time.  Don't stay at North Tower since that faces the Fremont experience stage.  You can hear music till 3am.  The windows are not sound proof.  The room looks nice but not enough outlets, the doors are old doors and won't close correctly, lack of water pressure, no cold water only hot water, no soap provided, no bed covers and skirt for the bed.   We paid $70 during labor day weekend.  Next time we will stick to 5 star casino.  In addition, you have to check in at 12 noon no earlier than that.",2
1817,1,1550620800000,"I stopped here Sunday about 1 PM for their lunch buffet.  It's $`10.99 and it's a good price and well worth it.

I was told to sit anywhere I wanted--all the tables are for four people so I had a large table to myself.  Rani came and cleared the extra place settings and asked me for my preference of naan.  In addition, he asked me about drink other than water and I ordered and iced tea.

My first plate was a small plate with one large samosa, palak paneer, and some chana masala.  The palak paneer and chana masala had a nice zing to them but it wasn't too spicy that someone would not enjoy them.  The samosa was filled with potato and some peas.  It was very tasty and the crust was flaky.

For my second plate, I got some chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, and basmati rice.  You'll notice no photo for this dish.  I enjoyed the first one so much that I just started eating and no photo.  The chicken was good.  I especially liked the chicken korma so when I went back for a third, smaller plate, I got more chicken korma along with goat curry and some sautéed cabbage because that seemed so different for an Indian restaurant.  All was good.  I made a final trip to have some gulab jamun to end on a sweet note.  

The restaurant is not very large but it's very pleasant.  The food is good.  I'm glad we have another option for Indian food on this side of town.  Service was very good.  I'll be back.",2
1818,3,1550102400000,"The chocolate theory... if you cover any edible items (poop doesn't count) in chocolate it will taste good.  Apple wood smoked bacon covered in chocolate...?  Yeah, the theory still stands.  This Godly product tasted really good.  First it's sweet chocolate then it hits you like punch to the FACE salty smokey bacon.  Oh baby!  Nice and savory.  

5 stars is for the imaginative nature of this chocolatier and the extremely friendly service.  If you ask to try they will gladly provide with or without buying anything.  The chocolate dipped tortilla chip sprinkled with chili powder was second favorite.  I didn't try the curry but my friend Michelle T. said it was the best!  

All the chocolate bars (like the size of a Hershey) are $7.50  Not too bad if you split it with friends.",2

My first visit here and it may be my last. I came here for lunch today, and went straight to the cashier area to order take out and the older guy behind the counter barely acknowledged me. 

I only ordered one thing.. banh mi beef sandwich. I told them no jalapeños. And of course the first thing I see when I open up my food.. jalapeños. The bread was not fresh, very chewy in a bad way. I do like how they sliced the beef thin, but it was also very dry.  

I may just stick to Hue Thai in Chinatown.",2
1832,1,1549670400000,"It feels wierd to write review for a fast place but when you get good service it should be acknowledged. 

I come here occasionally for dinner when I work late and don't feel lile cooking. The food is good, for fast food. It s always fast amd hot with friendly service. I came here for breakfast for the first time this morning. I enjoyed the breakfast, I got the chicken biscut and hashbrowns. The biscut was flavorful better than any other fast food place.

Why am I giving a fast food resturant 5 stars? Well the polite friendly service makes it go from 4 to a 5. They always say my pleasure. They also will give you extra condiments with out charging extra like most other fast food resturants. I will always come here if I am craving fast food.",2

We had a coupon for another location apparently, the manager came out and said ""next time.. look at the location on the email"", like we were stupid.

1856,2,1549756800000,"I was looking for a Hawaiian restaurant near my office in Old Town and Maui Dog came up. What an interesting concept, Hawaiian style hotdogs. I was amazed at the sheer number of positive reviews for this place, yet I've never heard of them. So into my Yelp bookmarks it went for the perfect afternoon to go here. After an amazing visit here (and 2 punches on my regular customer card) I'm hooked. 

If you think you'll leave hungry since it's just a hot dog, no you're wrong. I always get a brat and it's filling! I've now had the Island Dog and Hanalei Dog, my lovely date the last time I went had the Island Dog so I was able to have the best of both worlds. I also get the volcano spiced version. It's has a perfect amount of spice to it, so for the average eater, don't get it lol! 

As for the sides: 

I had the tater tots. They are great to share, unless you have an islander sized appetite then get your own. 

Shave Ice. They do it right here. We split a crazy concoction where they added a bunch of awesome flavors. They build it right. After adding some flavors, the ice melted down a lil, so they added more. Then top it off with ""crack"". We had a bunch of funny jokes around it but it's condensed milk. This place also doesn't disappoint considering your in AZ. 

So if you're reading this considering to go, make dinner plans tonight, or tomorrow for lunch. They need the biz and your stomach needs the flavor. It's tired of eating that frozen crap you keep in your office freezer. I hope to fill up my regular customer card sometime soon.",1

The place was dead on a Friday night, so that should have been our first clue to run the other way.  Margaritas were awful.  Chili's or On the Border makes a much better margarita than this place.  We got the volcano nachos to start and those came out at room temperature and about 25% of the shredded cheese was not melted.  My son got a kids meal with veggies for the side.  The veggies were nothing but onions and squash.  Rest of the meal was bad as well.  $70 tab.  So brutal for what we got.

I ordered the pulled chicken club sandwich and it came with two sides. I picked the spicy slaw and fries. The spicy slaw has a decent kick to it, so unless you can handle more than a 5 on a scale of 1-10, then beware. I loved it! The sandwich and fries were great as well. Good flavor on the chicken.

Great food, but had a terrible large group experience. Last year we had our staff Christmas party at Cibo and had such a good experience that we decided to book at Cibo again this year. We had about 35 guests and did the family-style dinner. Wow, were we surprised when we each received HALF the quantity of food compared to last year and each paid fully TWICE the price as last year!! Unbelievable!! Last year we each paid $40 each (includes gratuity, etc.) and this year we each paid OVER $80 EACH. Seriously, Cibo... who do you guys think you are??  Teatro? Ceasars Steackhouse? Ruth's Chris?  You guys serve pizza and fancy pasta... Albeit very good pizza and pasta. So we will definitely NOT be having our staff party there next year. Too bad, because they are a great restaurant with great food and atmosphere. Hopefully they can make some changes. 

**UPDATE - See Below**

I have changed my review from one star to five stars. The management of CIBO contacted us directly to apologize for the confusion and for the miscommunication of extra charges at peak times. In addition to this, the management gave each guest a $25 gift card and also offered to pay for a free ""pizza party"" for our staff.  Wow, VERY IMPRESSED with their manager Megan. Bravo CIBO. You went over and above to make it right. We now have good reason to book there again!",2

Then when it came time to pay, I had to deal with a computer interface which was demanding a preset selection of tips. The food we did manage to obtain was edible.",3
1962,1,1550102400000,Good food good size portions at a very good price will definitely come back.  Was very happy with the friendliness of the staff and the prompt service,2
1962,2,1551139200000,Such an amazing experience!! Ms. Asselta was so helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. She helped choose the best wine to complement my meal. And Michael the manager was terrific! I can't wait to return for date night! :),1

My wife and my two kids went and we all had different dishes, all was excellent. We had ceviche, campechana (seafood coxktail) carne asada huarache and chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Servings were big and service was great. Saw alot of molcajetes served at other tables, will try them next time we come to Vegas.",2

My only gripe was  my fries were so salty I had the brush each one off.  And my husband wanted coke to drink and it wasn't working. These reasons cost them a star.",2
1974,3,1549152000000,"Seriously such a nice panera. Opens early (6am) has a little cafe area by where you order (think a individual study sesh or quaint chat with a friend) & then more traditional seating (larger groups, more room to spread out) by the pick up area.

This one serves breakfast until I wanna say 11ish? But all other items are available at all times. You Pick 2's are so pricey now! But you can choose ANY half sammie and upgrade to a bowl of soup vs. just the cup.

Wonder what that ""no meal upgrade"" means on your receipt? It means you passed up the chance to get a bakery item at a *special* price. Don't make that mistake again!

PS - Get a chai latte, you'll thank me later.",2
1976,2,1549929600000,"I admit, I am not very adventurous when it comes to beverages. I drink black tea with honey in it, and not much else. But... I'm very glad I had a meeting scheduled here today! My colleague and I met and she guided me through the process. She highly recommended the boba and the woman behind the counter allowed me to try before I added it to my order. I went with the black tea, lemon flavor, no milk, lychee boba and it tasted like a delicious and fun Arnold Palmer that had the joy of the boba bursts! So, next time I go I may be more open to the other flavors... but, this kind was so good I might stick with it too!

There is a small case with sweets, but I was so focused on what I would order I didn't make note of what all was available.They also have the same rewards app as Sushi Fuku - so be sure to put in your number to get the rewards!",2

She got the items that we needed right away and was super efficient.  Found out that she is getting transferred to the Desert Ridge store.  This is what an ideal employee should be, friendly, engaging, helpful and efficient.  She exceeds all those.  Great employee!  Desert Ridge should be happy to have you!",3
1989,3,1550793600000,"I go to Devour every year, and always look forward to it -- it is my favorite food event in AZ. I loved the venue change to DBG this year. The setting was beautiful, and the space allowed for a much more relaxing, enjoyable day with friends. It had gotten far too crowded at PAM, where it was more like a food frenzy. The pavilions with shade and comfortable furniture made for a nice place to lounge with friends and take a break from all the food. And, as always, the food was amazing! And the wine! And the tequila! Can't wait for next year!",2

We waited for the next flight 3 hours later. I still have a chance too get home to LA. I'm a culinary student, I need to get back in time for class at 2:00pm. Standby flight at 12:30? We waited at gate 10. Watching everyone board even folks that literally ran up 2 minutes before their so called policy time of 45 minutes. I have already let two attendants know I'm on standby. Well here we go. First they let on an elderly woman on standby. No problem. Now a young lady also on standby with her eye seeing dog walks up with appear too be her brother maybe. Not knowing she and her dog?? We going too get our seats. Cause she bought one for her and the dog. I don't hate dogs are blind people. I hate BS. So the attendant calls my name and my wife name? We are excited cause we are going to get on the plane. Maybe make my culinary class after all. So the attendant walks us both down to plan entrance. She has a small discussion with the other attendants. They are speaking about the lady and the dog they let on before us. We can hear them talking. So she asked me over into the plane. Says sorry we only got one seat. You two got too decided right now who's going and who's staying? I said you told us we on board. She said Sir I never. Then said well? I said no I'm staying with my wife of 29 years. The people clapped as we walk back out the plan entrance with our heads held down. The attendant still was not sorry. We felt humiliated and embarrassed. No standby or brand new reservations. Stuck in Las Vegas. Hopefully they will keep their promise in 4 hours from now. I will probably not fly with American Airlines again. This was so rude.",2
1991,1,1549929600000,"I just happened to grab a quick bite here with a girlfriend and honestly, I'm glad we stopped by. The sushi was SUPER fresh, the prices were VERY reasonable and everything was very tasty. I would go back in a heart beat!",2
1994,3,1549238400000,Interesting concept but a little too overpriced for what you get. The place is very cozy and the service is great. What stood out are the Korean pancakes for $12... huge margin on those for the restaurant... very little value for patrons.,1
1999,1,1550966400000,"This was my 2nd time at Wag n Wash. 

I walked in at 6:45 PM yesterday, the store was completely empty aside from me and the 2 workers.  

""Can I help you?"" the young bonehead asked. 
""Yeah can we get a wash started.""
""You can if you can do it in 12 minutes,"" the idiot employee representing this small business says. 

This place closes at 8. Now there is a sign in the store that says ""start your wash 1 hour prior to closing."" But hey... I, a customer was there in person, not over the phone and the joint was empty. I have worked in animal care for a large rescue and I have cleaned up after 30 animals all by my lonesome in less than one hour. So Wag -N-Wash and your band of idiotic employees, surely 2 employees can clean one bath stall in less than one hour to accommodate a customer. I would have happily cut my bath short and kept it to 30 minutes, leaving these ""workers"" with 45 minutes to clean 1 stall. 

""We're open tomorrow,"" idiot says on my way out.

This is the future of our country. Lazy, brain dead fools with zero customer service skills, zero drive and zero work ethic. NEVER again Wag-N-Wash. Never! Owners get a clue. You're allowing these flunkies to run your business.",3

You lost a long time customer and all our family.",2
2014,1,1549670400000,"We just had dinner at RX boiler room in Mandalay Bay. I had the Colorado lamb shank and it was excellent. My wife had the salmon and it was cooked perfectly and delicious. My son had the catch of the day and his was very good as well. The food was excellent, the services up entirely different story.

When we were seated we were seated right underneath a speaker which was blasting for the entire room. Since we were the only ones in that room we asked if he could be lowered such that we could have a conversation. Someone came out did something and lowered it from 10 to 9 1/2. 

Our server Derek seem to be interested in conversation with other servers than taking care of the customers. Even getting the bill and paying it was painful.

In summation, food was a five, service and ambience one average is a three.",1

Ok so I was trying to get some pastries/cookies in their cases and there were flies in there! Ewe gross! I saw a guy drop a roll and put it back in the case! 
Second, the nasty men in there whistling and eye balling at women was gross! Wth? Really?????
The butcher dudes are pretty rude to just about anyone who doesn't speak Spanish. Well that's pretty much all the staff. 
The produce section smells like something is rotting! Just gross. The floors are dirty and the feel of the place is just yuck.",2
2016,3,1549065600000,The owner Annie is super sweet. There's usually never a wait and they get your food out pretty fast. Everyone here is nice in terms of service. Very clean facility. I always take my family here and they all love it. Perfect place to go in cold or rainy weather pho season,2

I picked it up, looked at it, and the sales staff member would not leave me alone - kept asking me questions ""Where are you from?"", etc and just hovered over me.  I would have purchased the phone cover if they just would have left me alone.  They are clearly paid on commission.  I will not be back.",2
2023,1,1549756800000,"I'll be candid: I came here to mange the flesh of wild animals the flesh of which I had not previously manged. So I was pretty disappointed when venison (that's carnivore lingo for deer flesh) was not available. Luckily, the baby seal was. I'm not actually sure if the seal was a baby or not, but I kind of hope that it was. Anyway, it was the highlight of the menu for me. We also ordered the Nordic shrimp in day lily juice (a little odd, but good, nothing too exceptional); smoked mussels (excellent); beef with malt cream, mushrooms and potatoes (pretty fantastic); beef scoter (solid); and arctic char (good). If I could redo anything, I would have tried the sucking pig instead of the Nordic shrimp. 

Apart from the high-quality, wild cuisine, the atmosphere and service were the perfect balance of classy and comfy without pretension. My only complaint is serving size. For the price, I think 10% larger portions would have been nice.",2
2025,2,1551312000000,"If you travel to Pittsburgh, you cannot leave without having Breakfast at Deluca's. This is a piece of Pittsburgh history, and the food/environment is truly wonderful! They are still running this place the way they did 50-years ago. Family run diner that is worth your time, and the small penny that it will cost for a large meal. I highly recommend going early on Saturday morning, grabbing breakfast from Deluca's and then exploring the Strip District.",2
2031,2,1550620800000,"The selection of food is better than Celebrity Hot Pot and the meat slices are finely cut and fresh BUT I didn't like their service and the servers are definitely not the friendliest. Also, they messed up the amount of order we had (they gave us more than we asked for, not sure what's their intention - I don't like to waste food but if you're giving more than I asked for I can't finish them) and they didn't bring all food we ordered. There's also a ""hidden"" charge, on the menu, small clear broth is ""free"" but when we got the sheet of paper to select our food, the small clear broth is $1 (I know it's just $1 but still I don't like how deceiving the menu is).",2
2033,3,1549670400000,"I have a longstanding rule - I only eat sushi in coastal states.  However, because of the Yelp recommendation, and the fact that it seemed the only decent restaurant anywhere near the Embassy Suites, I decided to take 3 work colleagues to Yasu.  I must say that we all enjoyed it.  I thought that the specials were well though out, well prepared, and very tasty.
As mentioned by others the service was a bit slow, and for those of used to old-school sushi places where they just place fish on a plate, the presentation was fussy.  It was also very difficult to take the lid off of the trash can in the men's room (and to be clear the ease or difficulty of doing so is not one of my usual criteria for judging a restaurant, but it was so difficult I thought it worth mentioning)

Ovverall I would definitely recommend this place and I would definitely come here again",2

2051,1,1551052800000,"My best friend was visiting from another province, and I debated on where to take her. Since Levetto had really good reviews (which are well deserved) and an interesting take on Peking duck, I decided to come try this place out.

Since there was only two of us, we shared the Peking duck pizza and a salad. The salad was huge. There was nothing particularly special about it other than its size, but there's no complaints coming from me about more food.
While the Peking duck pizza was clever and tasty, I thought there was an excessive amount of scallions on it. It really took away flavour from the rest of the pizza, so I ended up scraping most of the scallions off. Otherwise, great new take on a cultural food!

I came right as it opened so we were the only customers at the time. Service was friendly and quick. This location is a bit small, so I wouldn't recommend it for larger groups, but the food is definitely good.",2

I've been to this place a few times and every time I usually try something new. Each item Ive tried has always been tasty to say the least. 

However, since I live so close to MTO Cafe, I usually end up placing an order for delivery to get my fix. Prompt this delivery service it is, there is always something forgotten in the order i.e. Green drink, salad along with the chicken and waffles, a side mashbrowns, the list goes on. 


Nevertheless, it's always a very tasty, somewhat healthy, way to remedy my hangover, or simply stay home on the weekends for brunch. The second location just opened at the new summerlin mall, I will likely check out this location as well.",3

The woman cooking on the grill was obviously new and absolutely miserable from the moment we placed the order. 
The sausage was burnt black so we asked her to recook it.
More misery and comments from her and other workers.
The re cook was raw and undercooked, dangerous when dealing with pork.

2122,2,1549497600000,This has been my favorite place to eat for years for lunch or dinner.  They have delicious sandwiches which you can get either fries or pasta salad. I love both but I go for the pasta salad since I need to watch my weight. Their daily specials are great with my favorite being the fried baby flounder on Fridays. The tartar sauce is homemade and needs to be bottled and sold. It's so good I get extra to dip the fries that come with fish. (This is the one time I do get the fries). You can also get the twice baked potato instead which are the best too.  The fried shrimp with the flounder is also great. I think the batter they use on the fish and shrimp for frying is so light and makes all the difference. Their wings are excellent; my favorite is the Greek style wings.  Their pizza reminds me of the old Godfather's style pizza. Very thick and gooey with lots if cheese. This place is not for you if you're watching your weight even though they do have great salads with fresh made dressing too.  YUM!,2
2123,1,1550880000000,"Found mention of this place in a Newschannel 5 article online. Free scoops for the first day of Spring! Aside from the amazing deal, this place is a must-visit. The gelato is delicious and the prices are extremely reasonable. We sampled a few different flavors: caramel tasted amazing, but should've been labeled ""salted caramel"". Butter pecan was very good, but had a slight citrusy flavor. It was actually a pleasant surprise and helped lighten up the flavor a bit. The ginger snap flavor was well-balanced, with just enough ginger to complement the creamy sweetness of the gelato.

The wait staff was extremely friendly, and despite being only 30 minutes from closing time, they seemed genuinely happy to have us there. They enthusiastically told us about their ingredients (fresh, local, organic when possible and vegan at times as well) and offered up suggestions on what to try.

One final note: the flavor selection featured a surprisingly large number of chocolate variations. Chocoholics take note!",2

2131,2,1550880000000,Please take a minute to look at your process. You evidently need to revamp how orders come out. I waited 8 minutes for one drink. I use to come to your establishment at least every other day for a drink. If the drive through has eight cars in line and I am still waiting after the 10th car goes through the line this to me is an issue with the way your business is run. Managers/owners need to get out from behind the counter/desk and come outside to help! After 8 years of coming to this establishment I will not be back. I do have a choice - do you to lose at least one customer!,2

2144,2,1550534400000,"I was not crazy about Lil' Bacci when the patio club I participate in met there on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  

The good:
1. They have an excellent value-priced lunch combo here for $10.  For that ten dollars, you get your choice of soup or salad and your choice of a small (which is HUGE) personal pizza, a calzone or a pasta dish.  That is AWESOME value.  
2. They have good draught beers (which are not that cheap)
3. Their patio looks really cool but I haven't enjoyed any beverages out there yet.
4. Staff was good

The bad:
1. I didn't like my food.  I am torn between 2 or 3 stars here... because the lunch combo for $10 is SO good on paper.
2. I had a salad, which was mostly dandelion leaves.  It SAID dandelion in the menu, but I thought that that meant there would be a FEW yellow flowers in the salad, but really, it was a BIG plate (did I mention they have very generous portions?) of dandelion LEAVES, with olive oil and sea salt.  Sondra had soup instead of salad, and it looked REALLY good, and I should have had that.
3. Pizza - the pizza does not come cut into slices.  This was a huge WTF to me and it really pissed me off.  They had el-cheapo steak knives at the table which we all struggled to use to cut our pizzas.  My pizza was also pretty weak.  It was skimpy on the toppings and the prosciutto was in huge, whole piece slabs, that further frustrated my attempts at slicing the dang thing up.  Again, Sondra had gnocci and it looked stellar so maybe I just got the wrong thing.

Overall, I would go here on a sunny day and check out the patio for beers, but I probably wouldn't get food (even though at lunch it's very affordable).",2

With two small children our experience turned into a complete nightmare. Why on earth would you only have one teller open (who closed her window for 5 min so yes they weren't taking any orders for 5 minutes)?! It is completely beyond me. The service just was so awful that it doesn't justify the food being as good as it is. Someone needs to seriously reevaluate the service standards for this place. Such a shame.,2

I went here for breakfast with my normal group of ""Dining Friends"".  We go to restaurants all over the valley just to try something new.  The service can best be described as untrained monkeys aimlessly running around.  There was no organization, no method to the madness.  Our orders were messed up not once, not twice, but 3 times!! As a matter of fact, I am the only person that received the correct meal.  

Tim received the wrong thing.  He ordered oatmeal and got a parfait.  Then when his oatmeal came out, it was piled high with parfait items that he didn't want or order.  We got this fixed.  

Jessica's meal was super spicy.  Nothing abnormal here except she specifically asked if it was spicy because she has issues with too much heat in a meal and was told no.  At this point she ate part of my meal because we were so disgusted by this time, no one wanted to order anything else.  

James's meal came out wrong.  He ordered the meat version and got the veggie.  Not the biggest deal, but with strike 3 we asked for the manager.  Here comes the best part....Our waitress is the ""Head Waitress"" and the one in charge.  No other managers.  So we explain to her all of the issues and she walks away to get James his meal. She comes right back to explain that it wasn't her fault, the runner grabbed the wrong meal.  She spent SEVERAL minutes blaming everyone except the cable repair man for everything that went wrong.

Now again, mistakes happens and can be forgiven.  What can NOT be forgiven is the way we were treated.  The waitress went through great lengths to blame shift all of the issues on other people.  Never once did she apologize or try to really make the situation better.  It was all about her being in the right.  I guess I feel a little better knowing we were not the only ones treated that way based on one of our neighbors hearing our plight, striking up a conversation with us about a similar experience.  We could also hear random conversations from other tables.  NOT a happy day.  Perhaps a dedicated front of house manager could solve some of these issues.

I have made several jokes since then about trying this place again. I just find it hard to believe that EVERYTHING could go so bad in one sitting.  However, I refuse to spend my money at a place that obviously does not respect the people who show patronage.",2

The food was okay, but not fabulous (it's no Komol).  My seafood curry had a good amount of seafood bits in it, but it was WAY too much liquid.  It was like soup.  My husband got the roast duck pad thai, and that was pretty good.  Big portion.

- Skip the fried meatballs (pretty dry without the tzatziki sauce)
- My friend is Greek, and she said the Greek salad was spot on like her mom makes. I tried some of the feta with oregano, and it was deeelicious.

As a family owned and run shop, the service was very friendly and we talked about how many new businesses are going in at the intersection of Bethany and 16th Street. With new bars, restaurants, shops, a gym and even a kids gymnastic business, it's really becoming one of the gems of North Central Phoenix. Having a delicious cupcake shop is just an added benefit!

When I went for my appointment I had my insurance card and ID ready as they had asked the day before. When I was called up to the desk ( 10 min after arriving) I was told immediately that they don't take my insurance! I told the woman at the desk that they had just verified it the day before. She looked in a folder and said sorry we don't take this. I don't understand how I can sit on a phone call for 7 minutes the day before and be told to come in only to be turned away immediately!

2282,3,1549929600000,"Went here for lunch yesterday. Moving from the East Coast where pho places are plentiful and wonderful, was happy to see there were pho places here too! 

My first impression when I walked in was a good one. Courteous and sweet people greeting us at the front door. Nice looking place.

There are two main reasons for the 3 stars. The menu/options and the food itself.

The Menu: For a place that has Pho in the title, there aren't a lot of pho options. I'm used to going to a pho place with the 14 standard pho options... variations/combinations of eye round, brisket, flank, tripe, tendon, or chicken. There was no tripe here! That's my pho go to! There wren't any options really. I was so sad. BUT to be fair there were vegetarian options my husband got to enjoy... not something you see usually. So instead of 2, it's a 3 star compromise. Good Vietnamese drip coffee, but that's not too hard to make. 

The Food: The broth had too much five spice, you lose the beef's natural flavor/brothiness. And the eye-round was cooked already, which is fine but there's something tender and lovely about raw meat cooking in your broth to show how hot the broth is... BUT the veggie pho was a nice mushroom broth so vegetarians don't have to worry about the food. 

Maybe next time we'll try the other dishes. But the pho was ""eh, okay"". Didn't fill my pho needs, but it was alright with legitimate vegetarian options.",2

I specifically wrote that in the special instructions . It's just upsetting because I really like the food but my husband is beyond livid .. so no more Panna Thai.  READ YOUR ONLINE ORDERS !!!,1
2306,2,1549324800000,Went here for lunch with coworkers and was very underwhelming the wing flavors didn't match up they didn't come out piping hot and the dark atmosphere was a cheer up for me either. So needless to say I'm not rushing to come back!,2
2310,2,1550102400000,"My mom and dad came home from their Vegas vacation raving about this place, but couldn't remember it's name. Just that it had a lot of doors. So when my mom, cousin and I had to visit an ailing family member, we totally had to hit this pub.

After wandering around north Vegas for a few minutes, we spied this dark restaurant with green lights along the trimming. What cool decor! Especially at ten in the evening. Because where else can you find 24hr restaurants that isn't a Denny's, but in Sin City?

So we enter the front door and are affronted with for more doors. Two for the bathrooms, one for the dining area and another for the pub. The two differences between the pub is the ambiance, the age limit and smoking. If you're with people under the legal drinking age or want to be in a non-smoking section, take the left door.

We took the right door. The pub's decor is your typical lounge. There is a bar, a few tables, couches and lounge chairs. It was all very cozy. We sat down and ordered coffee with Irish cream, angry orchard cider, potato cheese soup, soft pretzel sticks, and Vegas fries.

If you like soft pretzels with mustard and horseradish, you'll love these.  They were the perfect consistency. The Vegas fries were tasty indulgence. Similar to nachos, they are fries red with tomatoes, carmalized onions, green peppers, jalapenos and topped with acreamy white cheese. They were very tasty and the presentation was cute, with a little fry basket next to it. The piece de resistance, though, was the potato cheese soup. It was orgasmic. Nothing but cheesy deliciousness and you still taste every other ingredient (pepper, potatoes, etc).

Our waitress, Bobbie, was a doll. She changed one of the channels for us, knew the menu and was so sweet. We went back to the house with our mouths happy and bellies full.",2

2367,2,1548979200000,"Oh my golly! This place is absolutely delicious. I stopped in to grab an early dinner to take back to the office. It took a bit of time to get my order. Next time I'd call ahead. It was definitely worth the wait though. 

I ordered the jerk chicken wrap (regular size) with a side of grilled veggies. You can get the wrap on a white or wholewheat pita and you can get the grilled veggies mild or spicy. Naturally I got mine spicy. You get a free beverage when you order a wrap and side. Good deal!

The jerk chicken wrap was a tidy little bundle of chicken, finely diced veggies, sauce, and seasonings. The veggies were grilled onions, peppers, and zucchini, They had great char and the Shombo spices were fantastic! It was all so good. 

When I first felt the weight of the bag, I thought, ""There's no way this is going to fill me up,"" but that's because I have a man-sized appetite. I finished my wrap first and I was pretty satisfied, but not satiated. The very delicious veggies brought me all the way and more to satiation. That is a good sized meal. If you just want a wrap without a side, I would recommend the large size rather than the regular. 

The spice on the jerk chicken wrap was more warming than hot on the tongue. If you're a spicehead, you'd probably put the spice level at about a 3 out of 10. If you're a spicewimp, it's probably more like a 5 out of 10. The spice on the veggies is probably about a 4.5 for spiceheads and 7.5 for spicewimps. 

I am so looking forward to eating my way through this menu! This is so much better than a crappy frozen burger from a crappy fastfood joint or a bland sub from a sub joint.",2
2369,2,1550966400000,"I wanted to like Kwan, it had potential to be likeable-- when you kind of paying a premium because it's located in a ~nice~ neighbourhood, there's a bit of that expectation. 

Food-wise, it was relatively good; it came to the table steaming hot and orders weren't messed up. Har gow and siu mai which are one of the quintessential dim sum dishes were basic, I felt it there should be something extra instead of something you can get at a dim sum place in Chinatown. 

The service however, was a little atrocious and giving them the benefit of the doubt, maybe they are understaffed? Weekends are more busier? Nonetheless, when my friends arrived for our reservation, there was a staff at the front almost shouting into the phone, taking what seems to be a takeout order. He ignored us and other people arriving for their reservation or getting a table. Logically, if there was a crowd at your front door, perhaps another staff could attend to them, but nope. In fact, we sat at a table right at the entrance to the dining space and through our lunch, periodically, there would be people waiting at the front with no staff in sight. 

It also took awhile to get attention for additional order and the bill. On a few plus side, the staff was efficient in clearing empty dishes from the table. 

I wouldn't come back here; yes, Chinese restaurants aren't known good service, but it's kind of expected. Kwan in summation is basically ok to good dimsum and Chinese-style service at a premium price. I rather not pay that kind of premium.",2

So 3PM cafe is a new Taiwanese tea house furnished heavily by Ikea items with snacks and minimal entrees. Teas are based off either black or green and then flavored accordingly and come in a fairly sized glass jar. Toppings include the usual such as boba and jelly, although at the moment they do not have jelly in stock. Everything is under $10 and you get a 10% discount with your UNLV ID. There is also free wifi, and I believe they're opened until 1AM?

Now the bad... The service definitely need works. Walking in my group went up to the registers to place an order, but was told to go to the table  to sit down and get our orders taken, although other people weren't turn down at the counter when ordering. Service was really awkward, and took multiple awkward looks with the wait staff to get our orders placed. Two egg and spam instant noodles($4.95) and a minced pork ($7.25) over rice took about 25 minutes to come out. Had to ask for silverware, kind of hard to eat instant noodles with a soup spoon haha. Food... needs to be revised. The two slices of spam were not even cut straight and the mince pork over rice.. well... was probably 90% rice and 10% minced pork, a bit pricey at $7.25. A third spam and egg instant noodle also came out for my friend who came late and never ordered one. 

Drinks came out at the same time even though they were ordered 10 minutes apart and came with the thick straws without plastic wrap, would not be a huge issue if it wasn't for two of the workers coughing in their hands, at least cough in your elbow. The guy making the drinks was also drinking the leftover from the drink mixer... I don't mind if you want the leftovers... but at least pour it into a cup? 

Overall organization is definitely needed for improvement, a POS system, and... sorry to say, but a review on the districts health card movie.

**EDIT**
BUMPED up from 2 stars to 3 because:

I was contacted by someone who works there and they claim to of washed their hands after they coughed and only drink the leftovers to check on the taste, I didn't see, but its best to give them the benefit of the doubt.",2

A wonderful little pot of salmon confit. The madeleines were actually jalapeño cornbread! Some marinated olives and a few stuffed Peppadews.

There was one very dried up, slim slice of honey ham folded on a piece of bread (not the 9 grain advertised). I think the white melted, blob was supposed to be swiss cheese. Now for the spud. I ordered it with sour cream and butter on the side. The potato was between luke warm and room temperature and just a little past tender. No amount of sour cream and butter or salt and pepper could make the sad potato taste good. Now for the good part of the meal, our food runner (a young blonde girl) was very plesant and offered to refill our drinks before we left. The counter/order taker was not in a good mood.

I ordered my typical BBH (Bun Bo Hue). Certainly not the best I've had, but by the time I reached the bottom of the bowl, I concluded that I really enjoyed it. The broth had a definite fish sauce aroma at first. Fortunately, that didn't translate into being too salty. The one thing I usually don't enjoy about BBH is that the noodles are larger and more slippery. Pho 88's BBH noodles were easy to pick up and slurp.

So my quick review is that if you enjoyed Pho Annie, you'll enjoy Pho 88. The advantage is that this location is much bigger and more open. (Annie used to get pretty full).",3

- Tapering
- Waist adjustments

Coats
- Peacoat made slimmer

Each time the result has been perfect. There was one time where I dropped off 3 pants and one of them wasn't fixed (they had forgot to do it) but they apologized and fixed them for me for when i went a few days later.

We ordered a pizza with mushrooms and prosciutto. What we were served was a pizza with like 4 mushroom pieces and HAM!!! We brought this to the waiter's attention and he went to talk to the chef. The chef sent him back out with a plate that had both prosciutto and ham on it, and he informed us that yes, the prosciutto-looking stuff on the plate was, in fact, prosciutto, but that the ham on the plate was just ""another type of prosciutto"". If ""prosciutto for suckers"" is a type of prosciutto, then I guess he's right!

Was excited to see the renovated rooms though I had never stayed here before the renovations. There is a big buzz over the revival of Freemont ST area and downtown in general. It is still a little honky tonk but young and vibrant energy.

The room was nicely appointed - all new throughout. Furniture was contemporary but not gaudy. Comfortable bed. Nice retro decorations and prints. The bathroom was real nice too - no slap up shower stall but all new tile work and fixtures.

(-)Freemont ST room has a nice view but will be noisy until 1AM+ with street activity and a band that plays at the top of the street so you may want to sacrifice the view if you are a light sleeper.

Check in/out was breeze and the front desk staff was pleasant and expedient. Food court and Mc Donalds were still under construction but the sundry shop had prices cheaper than most convenience stores. Casino floor was. One area needing help still (at the time I stayed) was the entrance by the valet/parking. Due to the property layout there is a small drop-off loop for taxis etc by the front desk. If you valet or self park you have to walk through the casino to the front desk from the south side of the property - looked a bit run down and thought it could have been renovated (may be on the list) especially since that may be the 1st impression one gets such as I did.

Will stay again and would consider paying upwards to $100/nt for a weekend stay.",2
2525,3,1550448000000,"Mmmm, so very good....

It's a beautiful restaurant, with a quaint 1950's glamor and style to it.  There is a complimentary valet parking, and there's a waiting room was plush with beautiful and immaculate furniture.  The host was very nice, and we were seating almost immediately.  

The table was just the right size for our party of 6.  The waitress was a mature lady, dressed nicely, and was to be addressed as Mrs. Tremble, as she informed us.  She was very explanatory in all the aspects of their unique restaurant, and kindly offered us our drinks after a brief pause, giving us just enough time to consider what to order.  

The service was very prompt, and the drinks were served nicely in beautiful glassware.  At some restaurants, the service sort of deteriorates if we don't order such things as appetizers, but Mrs. Tremble was gracious in everything we ordered and everything we didn't.  

They started first with their famous spinning salad.  It was nothing short of stunning, and it was worth coming for just that.  Next they served the prime rib, sliced fresh at the table.  My cut was served perfectly at medium rare, and I had an order of the creamed spinach, which in my opinion wasn't quite as creamed as I'd have liked, but still really good.   The mashed potatoes were delicious, but not the best I've ever had.  The centerpiece here is clearly the prime rib, and here it did not disappoint.  

The occasion was my brother's graduation from high school, and when the reservation was made, they asked immediately what the occasion was.  And after the meal was over, my brother was given a complimentary dessert, with ""Congratulations"" on the plate.  

I'd highly recommend Lawry's for any special occasion, though it might be a little bit pricey to go without an occasion.  Give it a shot, but expect to pay a little under $50 a person.",2

Bad idea! Me and my daughter went there for lunch on a Monday afternoon. We were the ONLY ones in the whole place (now I know why!).  When we walked in the place was nothing special and no one greeted us or sat us at a table.  We waited for what seemed like 5 minutes before some guy came out from the kitchen and reluctantly took our order.  We asked him about the lunch special that was clearly posted on the outside window but he had no idea what it included.  

We should've just left then, but I wanted to use the Groupon that I purchased and would probably not be on this side of town any time soon.  After he took our order, we sat ourselves down and about 5 minutes or so went by before a waitress came out to ask if we needed anything.  She brought us drinks and never came back until the food was done.  Both the appetizer and the main dish were both greasy and bland.  The food was definitely not anything to return for.  We waited and waited for refills on our drinks but the waitress never returned and we had to go get the attention of someone out of the kitchen to get our drinks refilled. 

I didn't think things could get worse, but once the bill came they did!  I showed the waitress the Groupon voucher on my phone (like I have been doing at numerous establishments for the past two years) and she had no idea what I was trying to show her.  She immediately got rude with me and asked me ""who sent that to you??"". I tried to explain how Groupon works, since she obviously lives under a rock, but she just acted like I was being ridiculous and giving her some kind of ""fake"" coupon.  When I finally made her understand that my phone was the actual voucher, she was even more rude than before.  Her exact words were ""what am i supposed to do with that?! How am i supposed to scan it??? THIS ISN'T A GROCERY STORE!!"" Wooooow! I couldn't believe my ears. How could she talk to me like that just because SHE didn't know what to do?? Is it my fault she lives in the stone ages and has no clue how to get a coupon off of my phone?!? She just kept telling me that ""they don't use that company any more"" and ""I don't think we can take that"".  She refused to even deal with me and my stupid phone coupon.  I had to pay the entire bill and was unable to use my Groupon.  

The service was horrible even before I presented the coupon and it got 10 times worse after, I would not recommend this place to anyone! I will contact Groupon tomorrow and get my money back (because THEY have great customer service!) and I WILL NOT BE STEPPING FOOT IN CARMINES EVER AGAIN!",1

The deal breaker however and probably the reason why my friends and I will not be visiting this restaurant anytime in the future is the service. 
Our first experience was very enjoyable our waiter was polite and attentive, but today when we went our waiter seemed distant and apathetic. When we attempted to make our second order, we had the all you can eat sushi, he informed us that last order time had past. He never informed us or warned us of a last order time. We wanted to end the meal with a bit of ice cream but were denied. The real problem came when it was time to pay. We were paying the bill half and half on two debit cards. He swiped one and said it declined. There was money in it we checked before and after leaving the restaurant. We just wanted to leave though so we paid full on the other card. It said decline again but this time we refused to believe him and asked to swipe again. The payment went through.

Location: Seven Hills... set amidst the rich and shameless mansions

Service: Top Notch

Layout / Topography: elevation changes, dog legs and fairways that are along the canyon walls... a couple of water holes 

I'm by no means a good golfer, but I like a challenge.

Yes....this course can be frustrating if you are not a straight hitter off the tee.  Thankfully, I hit it straight 90% of the time so I can see my ball on the fairway or find it on the 1st cut.

It is immaculately cared for.

#12 is my favorite.  Probably because (for some odd reason) I either par or birdie that hole... I don't know why... it should be a scary hole for me because you have to clear a waste area and hit the green otherwise you have a hell of chip onto the green.  Anyways... it's that hole that keeps me coming back for more.

#17 and #18 are really LONG and wide ... so grip it and rip it!

The view from #18 is spectacular!!  The whole LV valley is right before you.

The Restaurant is good too... I like that the bar area is low and has regular chairs and not bar stools. There are several TVs and you can catch up on the golf channel or whatever you want to watch while you eat. (If there isn't a crowd they will change the channel to your choice.)

We had a lot of little ones that were afraid to ride the ponies so she revised our schedule so that the kids would have a great time without having to physically ride the ponies! We fed the
 horses treats! My daughter loved seeing the horses and ponies and riding on the 'cow ride', even I as a parent really enjoyed the cow ride! I would definitely highly recommend having a birthday party or any other event here. You have your own covered gazebo, they have grills, and your party is completely separate from other parties! The staff was so nice and friendly. Nancy, the event coordination helped a lot with advice and previous experiences when planning our party!

2663,3,1550361600000,"This Nissan really sucked when compared the Pinnacle Nissan in North Scottsdale where I bought my car. I came in for a battery one afternoon, which shouldn't be complicated. I pulled up to the service center and literally waited at least 5 minutes for someone to acknowledge me. There was 1 car in front of me that was being helped already. I waited, and waited, my car was running because if I turned it off I wouldn't be able to start it again without a jump. It's not like it was busy. It wasn't until another car pulled up and waited along with me that someone finally came out to help. The guy was perfectly nice and polite. He offered a free car wash with the service, which I accepted. It took longer than I had expected to get a new battery, but since it was free and covered under warranty, I didn't complain. Then when it came time to get my car, the service rep said they would come up with my car. I waited on the curb for it, and waited, and waited, and watched my car sit on the other side of the service area, for another 10 minutes. The guy who brings the cars around finally dropped off a car and asked me which one was mine, he went to get it, said something about the car wash, which should have already been done. I then waited, and waited, and waited for my car to come around after he got in it. I've never had to wait so long at Pinnacle! They get two stars because of the car wash, but I would avoid this Nissan dealer.",2

2670,2,1550966400000,"You'd think that between hole-in-the-wall Sultan's Grill and a more established-place like Paymon's, the bigger restaurant would win.  I've gotta say, I really like some of Sultan Grill's foods better.  Their taboule has a better flavor than the taboule at Paymon's and is fresh and fluffy rather than heavy, dense and weighed down with olive oil (like Whole Foods' is).

Some people have complained about the gyros, and I do wish they used only lamb rather than beef and lamb for their gyros and entrees. I don't order gyros from them because I've had better meat elsewhere.  Their falafel is pretty awful (hey, that rhymes!).  

Their baba ganoush is garlicky heaven. The hummus has a nice, creamy texture and tastes great. I even like the rice they serve on the side. The french fries are flavorful.  But I order from them because I love the salads, like the fatoush- YUM!   

The ambience is definitely dive-level. Rickety tables and cheap chairs. No decor to speak of.  But I usually don' t eat there since they deliver and do carry out (love the delivery guy! Hi, if you're reading this, delivery guy!)  

I know a few people have left poor reviews that seem to be related to the gyros/meat. Sultan's Grill should improve that to attract more people. My four stars are for the hummus, baba ganoush, generous pita portions, the salads, the friendly service, and the delivery.",2

 Even if you don't like tea, just try one of their fruity flavors with popping pearls & you wont be disappointed (or even taste the tea).

No complaints about service, our waiter was spot on. The appetizers were tasty enough. The burrata on garlic bread was delicious. We ordered a bunch to share but the small portions made it difficult. It was all good till the mains arrived. I ordered what was basically a pork medley on soft polenta and was completely let down. It had no flavor, just pork and polenta. my friends who ordered the fish were also equally underwhelmed. The only person who enjoyed their meal was my friend who ordered the lamb. It was the most expensive thing on the menu and all he got were two tiny pieces of meat. This is basically what bugged me most about this place. Its a complete rip off.

We had the following: Foie Gras, Tuna Adobo, Shrimp Capellini, sides of Au gratin potatoes and grilled asparagus. Carl had a glass of wine and I ordered a Guiness Stout.  Let me start with the drinks. How chic to be handed an Ipad to choose  your drinks. Really one of the last things I want to manipulate is a Ipad tablet to order a glass of wine and beer. I asked our server plan and simple "" do you have Guiness?"" As the server hovered over trying himself  to manipulate the Ipad, He found it and then he brought it to our table and placed the bottle and glass unpoured. Now every place I have been to before has always poured my Guiness for me. ""There is an art to pouring a Guniess"" This time it was just placed on the side of the table unpoured and then went back to get Carls wine. I am going to let that go... Let me move to the Foie Gras In a word ""Bitter""  Bitter on the pallet. Foie Gras can be one of those things that can be hard to make. Lets move on to the entrée. I was very concerned about get something to heavy or spicy "" we had an evening of playing in front of use"" I asked the server to describe the Tuna Adobo to me. He said it was basically Tune seared any way I would like it and served with a tomato foundo. I was concerned about how spicy this may be and requested it served with the tomato fuondo served on the side. I also requested the tuna served as rare as possible.  When brought to the table the Tuna was over cooked and place on a large amount of tomato fuondo. (which was incredibly spicy. Let me describe it as ""HORIBLE and GROSS"" When I made the complaint the waiter said that I was to sensitive.  Now lets go to Carl's Shrimp Capellini. Again over cooked tough and chewy.  With  no flavor.  We never send food back to the kitchen this is just a bad practice. (You can only imagine why)  When I order food it should come the way I request it.  Lets move to the Grilled asparagus.  Apparently they do not know the difference between grilled and steam.  The Asparagus was STEAMED. Carl choose to say something to the manager on duty who could not seem to be bothered with his concerns.  He did however send over a cheap pink champagne.  And did take off the tuna on the bill. Carl was served cake and crème bulee for his birthday ""gratis"" apparently it was plated much earlier in the day for it was dry and crusty and the crème bulee was tasteless and very cold.  Now I believe that every one needs to make their own choices on how you like your food but when something is described by a server than that is what you should get.

They have great tuna salad too. Homemade and chunky with boiled eggs.  Can't go wrong.  Their daily special sandwiches give you a break on the sandwich, chips, and a drink.  It's a true neighborhood spot and it's always great to run into people I know.   Lots of business lunch goers and folks from the nearby hospitals.

The decor was modern and clean,  ambiance was nice as you can actually converse while enjoying your dinner.

They have an array of selection of set menus for parties of 2 or more. The meats are tender, melts in your mouth. The flavors are undescribably good. The sides included are a variety of vegetables,  pickled radishes and of course to top it all was dessert. We did not get to take picture except for the dessert which was shaved ice with powdered chocolate on top, its a simple creation but it made a big impact.

Did I say our server David was very attentive and always had a smile on his face. My only suggestion is that,  maybe they can tell us what meat was being cooked. Also, when the lady brought the desert to our table she just set it down without saying anything. We had to ask what it was since we did not order dessert but I guess it came with the set. That's the reason for the 4 star. I think it just lacks a bit of conversation from staff to customers.

Only reason why I'm knocking down one star is bc if I need stuff for pretty much any type of ethnic food, the selections are pretty sparse here.

The salad Chef Luigi prepared was a terrine consisting of a layer of heirloom tomato slice, with wilted kale and fresh mozzarella slice topped with crispy artichoke and garlic chips and accompanied with a Romanesco sauce--very delicious and the textures pared great.  The next dish was a fish course, this was a special scallop and shrimp presentation.  The scallop was extremely fresh--a day boat scallop from Maine, and this was seared perfectly and accompanied with a yam puree and a vanilla sauce.  The shrimp was a whole shrimp, broiled and served with sautéed mushrooms--very good.  Excellent fish course.  The main course was a beautiful wagyu beef, sliced and atop bone marrow in bone all topped with a brown butter sauce.  This course Joseph pared with an Adelsheim Pinot Noir from Oregon--very great color, balanced, strong cherry aroma and hints of raspberry.

Maybe my expectations for Timber Mesa were set by a higher bar than normal.

I purchased an Archery Class for 2 people (including equipment rental) through Groupon.  Making the reservation was painless; but they said they were booked out about 6 weeks for lack of instructors working on a daily basis.  When it came time for our class, I found it hard to believe they were booked up as there was no one waiting before us and no one waiting after us and no one using the facility at the time we were there.  The gentleman at the front desk gave us our equipment (cheapest bows) and told us how to hold the bow and arrow and then said we were free to shoot for an hour or more--alone.

There were definitely more diners there on the second visit but apparently not any increase in kitchen or wait staff because it took almost 30 minutes to get our food once it was ordered (and it took extra minutes for the wait staff to take our order as well).

My earlier review was 5 stars so I tried one of their Po Boy sandwiches this time instead of the Jambalaya and Gumbo and it was very disappointing.  I was expecting something more than a Subway sandwich for $12 but that is exactly what I got.  A giant sausage on a nondescript roll with a standard tomato slice and lettuce.  Although it was a good sandwich it was very expensive and did not stand out.  One of my other diners also ordered a Po Boy and was equally disappointed.

Of the other three diners in our party two stuck with food they had tasted in a previous visit and were not disappointed but the third one was.  I don't recall what she had but it seemed to be some sort of shrimp on rice dish.

2820,3,1551225600000,"For anyone that has been to the Markham Kaka, be warned, you are NOT going to like this location. A lot of the other reviews on here complain about the long wait times and the fact that there is no iPad ordering system. The wait times at the Markham location are really no different, and can be long and painful without reservations, especially on weekends. I don't miss the iPads either, as the paper ordering system seems to work just fine. The real trouble with the downtown location is that the sushi is just not that good. The presentation is lazy and haphazard and looks to be thrown together hastily without much care. Several of garnishes had fallen off of the sushi and onto the too-large plates and that's how they were served to us. More importantly, Once we tasted the food it was very clear that the quality of the sushi was mediocre at best; more akin to a run-of-the-mill AYCE rather than the quality we had come to know from the Markham location. Even the torching on the aburi sushi (which has always been Kaka's star feature and selling point) was lazy and negligible. Lastly, like many of the other reviewers on here, I will also agree that items from your orders do often get left out or missed, and given my overall experience, I have some concerns that it might be done  intentionally. 

It has been a while since I've visited the Markham location, so I don't know if they have kept up with their quality. I won't recommend to readers to trek it to Markham as that it may not be feasible for everyone. However, if you are able you should give the original location a try for yourself and see the difference. My suggestion otherwise is to take a trip to Taro's Fish on Sheppard Ave. instead.

Their Forrest, ube, and mango cake are my favorites. I LOVE their mocha mamon, but there's also the butter mamon for starters.

They have a small selection of food, which is perfectly fine, but I will say that I come here specially for either the Arroz Caldo (chicken rice porridge....ask for lemon packets and fish sauce on the side because it is delicious with those!) or Pancit Palabok (Filipino noodle dish...look it up. Also, good with lemon). You can order those ala carte or as meals (I know a couple of options comes with your choice of empanada or slice of cake). You can order Palabok as a party tray as well, but just be sure to invite me.

I know there's two other Filipino restaurants next door to Red Ribbon that carry Palabok, but I really enjoy theirs. If you like thick noodles, look elsewhere though.

Their Arroz Caldo is delicious for a cool day or just to feed yourself after grocery shopping.

When you're done eating, don't forget to purchase a hug full of mamon for work, family, or friends. They taste so light and good!",1
2828,2,1549411200000,"This is the first time I've tried Afghan cuisine and I was happily surprised. We ordered the chicken kabob lunch special, $8.99, as an easy introduction to Afghan tastes. Perfectly cooked, juicy and nicely spiced. The rice tastes like it's cooked with cinnamon, but when I asked I was told it's not and that it's a combination of afghan spices. The rice is really good. Salad was lightly dressed and refreshing. The hot sauce was excellent, not too hot and very flavourful. 

This is not a fast food restaurant it seems that all the meats are cooked fresh. So have patience, I think it's worth the wait.

The restaurant is newly renovated, modern and very clean. There is lots of seating available with many booths.

2842,1,1550966400000,"I am really disappointed to see so many so-so reviews of this place.   I have been quite a few times and the coffee drinks and food have always been terrific.  I had a white chocolate Mocha latte that kept me going all day-- I usually stay away from the fluffy, sweet coffee drinks as they just don't pack the punch of a double espresso ,but this one was great!   As well , the roast sirloin sandwich was quite tasty (although, I did ask for the aioli on the side and although it was, there was an odd spread of mustard on the bread, which was not listed on the menu).  

Service has always been friendly and helpful and I do love the decor/feeling of the place.  The old willo house always had a slightly grime-y feel to it and I really wondered if they ever cleaned behind that counter.  

SO, let's just remember that this is NOT a chain restaurant, this is a LOCAL place that we can walk to, and it is a SMALL business that we should support just because it is a good idea.    

Really, if we would get off our high horses,  and stop poo-poo this and poo- poo that  , and realize that if we don't support local businesses, we will end up with a WALMART at Central and McDowell.   

Give 'em good feed back, constructive critisism, and let's keep a Payday loan store from taking the space!",2

This is a modern take on Mexican food that you will not find at any other place here in Phoenix. They have a house made grapefruit soda that they put in their Loma Bonita and it is to die for. (I had 3 ;))

Apps: The Nichie Nachos - Creamy and cheesy, TO DIE FOR! The Pork Belly Tostada had an egg cream that complimented the black bean puree. 

You must get the Puerco beans to compliment your tacos. 

I've been to Chico Malo a few times so I've tried almost all the tacos they offer. My favorite is the pork belly! Its spicy and sweet. 

If you are going for dinner I would suggest the Layered Pollo Fundido that comes with a braised chicken leg on the side or the Chile Ribeye that melts in your mouth. 

Finally, are the desserts!!! I ordered the Pineapple Chili Panna Cotta and my husband ordered the Tres Leches Rice pudding. Both were outstanding. I cannot wait to go back and try some of their salads at lunch. Till next time!",2
2866,1,1549324800000,"I stumbled upon Cala's Pizzeria thanks to Groupon.  So my fiance and I decided to give it a try, because what did we have to lose, 10 bucks?

The restaurant is small and cozy, and filled with regular diners.  The staff was friendly and attentive, and it was a simple, fun dining experience for a Saturday night.  My fiance isn't the most adventurous eater, so the fact the menu was filled with all the Italian favorites -- pasta, pizzas and sandwiches -- made both of our mouths waters

Leave it to him to try one of Cala's signature dishes, the pizza burger.  Not only was this sandwich absolutely ginormous, but I also thought he was going to have a heart attack right there in the booth.  It was comprised of two large pieces of pizza (the bread) filled with the largest sausage patty I -- or Jimmy Dean -- has ever seen.  I tried a bite and it was fantastic.  

The eggplant parmesan sandwich I ordered seemed to pail in comparison to the monstrous pizza burger but it was still delicious.  The eggplant was crispy and delicious and a great complement to the cheesy breadsticks we order.  

So if you're ever on the East side looking for a no-frills, inexpensive and delicious Italian meal, stop by Cala's.  But only tackle the pizza burger if you haven't eaten for days or have an army to share it with.",2

2874,1,1550361600000,"2.5

The dim sum here is alright. I mean, I'm pleased that I actually had chili slices with my phoenix talons and in my beef tendon...which tasted very similar, and I'm thrilled that they have taro in what they call beehive or honeycomb or something (for those of you who speak Canto, I'm referring to wu gok). I'm also happy that the majority of the dishes we served were fairly decently portioned (the place I usually go is on the small side, but it matches the prices). 

What I'm not so pleased with is that the food is seriously expensive. A small runs for $2.90, and there aren't many of those on the menu. Even spare ribs in black bean sauce, which is usually a small, is a medium here. Mediums are $3.90 or something around that price point. Large is $4+, XL is $5.8, SP is $6 something! And the portions on these don't match some of the prices. We got the vinegar chicken feet and there was around 6-8 feet. This was a size XL (so $5.80). Chicken feet are cheap. Why am I paying so much for these? Well, grandpa wanted them. That being said, I was expecting a whole lot of them for that price. The deep fried squid tentacles were a size Large, if I'm not mistaken. The portion was about a size medium, and most of the tentacles were the lower half of the tentacle. They didn't season it much, and they didn't cover it with anything before deep frying it. The result was a very dry, almost jerky-like deep fried tentacle. Super chewy. Didn't enjoy it.

Service for the most part went alright. Then I had a bit of a tiff with one of the hosts. I ordered pan fried pancakes with seafood and mushrooms. What I got was pan fried blocks of shredded taro. I don't read Chinese. I can only read English. I wanted what I ordered in English. What I got was apparently what I accidentally ordered in Chinese. When I asked the host, in English, why I got taro instead of seafood and mushroom pancake, she told me it was what I had ordered. I pointed to the English, and said there was no seafood or mushroom in my not-pancake. She told me if I wanted that one, I was supposed to tick the box above the one I had ticked. I let her know that I had followed the menu, and that the menu was wrong. The English and the Chinese did not match up. She kept telling me I was wrong. My aunt finally explained it to them, and they apologized, but nothing was done about the mistake.

I'll be back (cuz my cousin's wedding banquet will be here), but I won't voluntarily be back, even if the food is okay.

On the upside, they use real Chinese mustard, and not hot dog yellow mustard.",2

Also, it was misleading because on the receipt it says ""suggested tip"" not ""tip included"".

I have been to the square one location a few times and it has never disappointed. Service is excellent and the food comes out quite fast. Be sure you come hungry as they start you with some freshly baked bread with the oh so gooood honey butter!
I always order medium rare prime rib as my entree and it is spot on- the 6oz portion is just right for me or even  a tad too big but it is cooked to perfection!! The most recent visit was for a team lunch and since it was my first time here for lunch, I thought I would have to go with something else other than my usual- that didn't happen because they had a prime rib sandwich. Instead of the usual onion bread, I opted for sour dough bread and it was an amazing combination. It was so tasty that I was already thinking of my next visit lol! 
We also ordered a few apps to share, they included edamame, asian nachos, calamari and the Canyon Creek dip. Each of the items were really good although I thought the Asian nachos were a little too spicy for my liking. The portions were just right for 7 people since each of us had an entree. 
One thing I learned that day was that the square one location was a 'test' restaurant, which meant that this was where they tried out the new dishes before releasing them to the other Canyon Creek restaurant- super cool!

This is a wonderful, South-Scottsdale gem that just keeps getting better!  

Here's Why:
*Food, OMG, seriously amazing. I have tried multiple things on the menu (weekend brunch, lunch, dinner, and desserts) and never had something I did not think was outstanding.  Fresh, flavorful, innovative takes on traditional items (while staying true to many of the great things about Mexican cuisine).  This is NOT Tex-Mex, its real flavors that some of the best dining in Mexico has to offer.  
*Staff/Service, you will probably almost always see one of the owners there when you come in, they are very involved in ensuring a great delivery but even when you don't, the staff is truly outstanding.  Ask them for recommendations, they will never steer you wrong and they are happy to accommodate special requests whenever they can.  They treat you like family. 
*Atmosphere, I am ""partial"" to their large outdoor patio in back, you might not even realize it's there from the street but it's a great spot to dine (weather permitting) and the outdoor bar while small, is quaint and reminds me of some of the great beach-side bars in Mexico.

Hot showers, but poor water pressure.

We placed a weekends worth of breast milk my wife had pumped in the fridge so my wife could have a few drinks, while I was sober and bottle fed.

First off don't judge this book by its cover. It is very unassuming from the upside and the ""Huge"" we're open sign in the window lets me believe they must be struggling for customers.  Once inside you can tell the owners have put a lot of money into making it a nice place.  It is very clean and the salsa bar was a nice touch.

I have the three taco place with ground beef hard shell tacos.  Immediately I was a bit disappointed as the shells were notate from scratch but store bought taco shells.

3014,1,1550016000000,"For a chain, I thought this was actually pretty good.  Decent amount of food for what you pay for.  We had a couple of the special Caborita's - really tasty on a hot day - and we didn't get suckered into paying for some cheap ass souvenir glass with this one (unlike another spot on the strip recently reviewed by me).  We tried the Nacho's with the Carne Asada - HUGE order of Nachos, but we were starving and eat every bite - hold the jalapeños for me, but everything else on that plate was really great.  For lunch, I had the Carne Asada taco plate - with rice and beans - after the gigantic nachos, I could only eat the tacos and did a tasting of the rice and beans - everything was really good and some points for a nice presentation.  No waiting, service was quick and our waiter was always one step ahead of us with water refills and checking on us during a busy Memorial Day weekend visit.  I'd go here again and try more things on the menu.  Cool Millenials with those fake cigarettes that only blow vapor where everywhere - so you know it must be hip! LOL",2

Everything tasted the same.  Veggies were barely cooked and in quite large pieces.  Maybe it's a personal preference but I don't like hard veggies that require a knife in my lo mein or wonton soup.  The wontons in the soup were the only redeeming aspect of this meal.  Would never order from here again, even if I was just looking for quick, cheap, delivery.",2

3046,3,1549324800000,"The way that every Chinese dinner ends is with  (Tong Sui, which literally means, sweet water).  The term itself refers to any sweet, warm soup or custard and is a Cantonese specialty that stands in a category of  its own for desserts. [1]The most common type you'll encounter would be  (Red Bean Soup).  However, it can get tiring.  So when I want to have a Chinese dessert that is anything other than red bean soup, I either turn to Hung Fook Tong or Double Ming Chinese Dessert.  Unfortunately, Double Ming was closed (around 9PM on Sunday) so we went to Hung Fook Tong.

I find the crowd at HFT is a mixed crowd.  You have your older couples that come here in groups of couples, families, and adolescents.  The lighting is extremely bright and there are a mixture of booths and wooded chairs for seating options. 

The service here is a hit and miss depending on when you're here and how busy they are.  You basically write down the item number, whether or not you want it hot/cold (if applicable) and then wave down a server.There are quite a few items on the menu that require 15 minutes preparation (e.g. Steamed Whole Papaya with Egg Whites & Milk, Steamed Egg Whites to name a few).  That is because these dishes need to be steamed  slowly on low heat (obviously because you don't want to be eating curdled egg whites).  My tip would be to call ahead so that when you arrive its ready.  Otherwise, your dining companions might be long finished eating, and then there's the awkwardness that ensues when you're the only one eating!

Other than your regular Tong Sui, there are also various jellies, mochis, herbal teas, and even waffles if you're not brave enough to try out foreign things.Tonight we were a party of four and opted for individual desserts and we also ordered a few to share. 

I ordered the Steamed Whole Papaya with Egg Whites and Milk.  This is somewhat of a ""delicacy"" item and is available sometimes at dim sum restaurants, but usually for a hefty price tag (around $9 or so).  Its not that its particularly hard to make, because you basically take a baby papaya and then scoop out a square where the milk and egg whites go.  But it always amazes me how good a simple steamed papaya, filled with what is basically a steamed egg white custard tastes.  The papaya's natural sweetness was definitely enhanced through the steaming process.

To share, we ordered a Chrysanthemum, Longan & Wolf Berry Jelly.  Presentation-wise, its not impressive, but this is a very refreshing dish to have - especially in the summer time.We also ordered the Durian ""Hearts"" which are basically mochis with a durian filling in the centre.  This mochi reminded me of ice cream mochi as the durian in the centre was nice and cold and the natural creamy and buttery texture (in a good quality durian) made for an ice-cream-like consistency.  Yummy!

For those of you who are familiar with durian, it is sort of like the stinky tofu of fruits and a rather acquired taste.  You either love it or hate it.  It also makes  a huge difference to buy it fresh.  Most people who hate it, are the ones who have had the frozen variety.  The reason why that is is because it is a very precise art to open up a durian.  A durian is a very spiky fruit that grows on trees (hate to stand under one and have one fall on me - eek).  The fruit itself is contained in ""pouches"" or ""pods"" and so the way in which one opens the fruit is crucial.  If you don't open it properly, you won't be able to access the fruit.   I also got to try the Black Sticky Rice with Toddy Palm Seeds.  I was not a real fan of this dish as I found the bit of sourness from the coconut milk unpleasant.  The toddy palm seeds were also a little too firm for me, and I would've liked them to have been a little softer.  

I usually steer away from their desserts with glutinous rice balls as they don't have any filling in them and I would rather not be eating flavourless globs of dough. 

The total for 4 individual desserts + 2 desserts to share came to about $43 with the steamed whole papaya being the most expensive item (at $9).  Desserts here range from $4-$30 (if you get anything with swallow's nest in it). 

Verdict:

Hung Fook Tong  is everything that you would expect out of a Tong Sui shop and Leung Cha Po (herbal tea shop).  The two usually go hand-in-hand. 

Chinese desserts tend to err on the side of being less sweet as we tend to enjoy savory as opposed to sweet.  In fact, most Chinese (especially the elder generation) tend to find western desserts to be too sweet. 

Most Chinese desserts claim to have some sort of health benefit to them.  Stories of how papayas lead to breast enhancement, and hasma leads to improved skin clarity means the ladies are frequent customers at these tong sui shops. 

For me, I just come for the steamed whole papaya in all its sweet glory!",2
3048,1,1550275200000,"Excellent dental hygiene service and comfortable with NO novocaine injections, yeah!

But the star of the show was the soupe du jour.  When the server described it to me--barley, corn, etc--I was less than enraptured.  But I am SO glad we tried it anyway!  It had such a delicious, unique flavor... I'm guessing a result of dill and lime in the mix.  It was easily the best soup I've ever had.

I tried half of their menu. Hot pot is my favorite. Not the traditional Chinese family style hotpot but rather a pot of fishball-veggie-meat-shrimp mixture. Caution: MSG. Fried rice is decent.

Whether you sit outside or on the patio, you will get the feel of the islands. Although the food is good, it can get a bit pricey for what it is. I had the Jamaican grilled chicken and it was $18. Tasty but $18 is a bit steep. My wife had a sandwhich for around $12.

The signature Mojito, ""Mojito Cubano""  was overly fufu.  They pack the drink with ice and make it like a slushy.  I asked for my second with significantly less ice and it still had too much.

3227,1,1549324800000,"Let me just start out with this - Greenhouse Tavern is effing AMAZING.  I've heard about this Cleveland culinary powerhouse since it's opening a few years ago but, sadly to say, never checked it out until a few weeks ago.  The planned visit all started when my boyfriend discovered their pig head entree and set himself on feasting on this plate.  So, with that came a Sunday night date night with my one and only and a gigantic head of pig.

The vibe is unique and instantly lovable.  It's very chic and contemporary but has a home-y kind of feel with the natural wood walls and tables - the look is very organic and relaxing.  We started with a beer and wine - great selections btw - and made our order - the chef's tasting menu.  Now beware - this is A LOT of food - so much, in fact, that split between my boyfriend and I we took home about 75% of what we were served (but we're not complaining - the delicious-ness came home with us).  We started with the animal style frites - if you don't try anything else here you need to try these!  Fries with curds, gravy, bacon, two fried eggs, and whole grain mustard - my mouth has never been happier.  The only downside of this was that it was our first ""course"" so we had to force ourselves not to completely indulge since we had 3 more to go - one of which being that damn pig head!

From there we had a version of their Sloppy JO-Nut - again, delicious-ness - which was a stuffed chicken (instead of beef) & BBQ and we had the Crispy Hominy, which was pork skin cracklins, pickled red onion and lime juice (nothing like loading up on pork products before being served the mother of all pork products).  After finishing these two courses we were now left waiting anxiously for the main event.

I'm going to be brief with this part of the meal because I could go on forever about how awesome it was - ORDER THIS PLATE because you will be oh so happy you did.  Everything about it was great - you can make your own pulled pork sandwiches with buns they set on the side, the meat is so tender and the seasoning is mouth watering.  Just know this - these things sell out fast so we were lucky we called to let them know we wanted one because they only had one left that night.  

All in all, I will say Greenhouse counts as one of my favorite dining experiences in Cleveland.  The service was great, the food and drink was excellent, and the overall vibe of the place is incomparable.  I will definitely be a regular of this gem from here on out and will be recommending it to everyone. So with that being said - don't wait any longer and get to Greenhouse Tavern ASAP!",2

3247,2,1549238400000,"My husband and I were vacationing in Charlotte for only 2 days and decided to make Dot Dot Dot one of our stops. We purchased the membership prior to our trip since we had read it's best to have it ahead of time. 

It was a Sunday night so we expected it wouldn't be crowded. We arrived around 8:30 for dinner and were told we had the choice between the bar or a table. The hostess recommended the bar, so we took that option. The bar is beautiful and the bartenders are mixing up some very fancy drinks, which can be fun to watch, so I could tell immediately why she had made this recommendation. 

Here are the highs and lows of my experience: 
Highs: 
-Loved the cocktails.  It's their specialty. They put a lot of thought and effort into it and it shows. Our bartenders ""Andrew"" & ""Andrew"" haha...were both great. They were personable and made some great recommendations for our short stay in Charlotte. Please note we did not come here looking for happy hour specials or cheap drinks, we knew going in the price on these drinks was a bit higher and were OK with that for the quality. 
-We shared the crab cake, poke, pate', wagyu steak and pasta w/ peas.  The food was incredible. The only dish that didn't wow me was the crab cake. It was a bit dry. I wanted to order seconds on everything else though. I was incredibly impressed with the food overall. 
Lows: 
-The crowd was not what I expected. It was a Sunday night in a members only cocktail lounge that prides itself on being ""classy"" but this crowd was, not that. To my right was a group of 4 incredibly loud and drunk people with no regard for the people around them. They were making so much noise we couldn't even hold a conversation. Once they left, the entire experience improved dramatically. 
-I'm a dessert person and was disappointed to find out there are no dessert options. Even if they offered one dessert option and made it liquor infused and stuck to their theme, I think that could make a good addition to the menu. 
-We were ready to order another food item around 9:45 and were told the kitchen might be closed. We had thought the restaurant was open until 2AM (didn't realize there was a change to their hours recently) and while they accommodated and put the food order in for us, it would be nice to get a ""last call"" type of offer at some point so we would've known we were cutting it close on ordering. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and plan to return even if only while vacationing. :)",2
3250,3,1550448000000,"From the looks of it, you probably wouldn't expect much from this cafe.  Usually the cafes you find in an office-type building are average at best.  Looking at their menu may not sway you either, since salads and sandwiches tend not to sound so exciting, especially when they're focused towards health.  Bronze Cafe will dash all your expectations in a good way.  The food here is superb.  I was lucky enough to sample various things off their menu and everything I tried was delicious.  The ingredients are fresh and the way Chef Peter brings them together is amazing.  My absolute favorite item was the David's Special; I wish I could eat this salad every day.  The Tree of Life Pita was another highlight, even as someone who usually sticks with meaty foods.  The smoothies are as amazing as the food, especially the pumpkin one.  It was delectable dessert in a cup.  And their actual desserts don't fail either, even the vegan ones (which I'm usually skeptical of).

3262,2,1549584000000,"The staff members at Audi Chandler are some of the friendliest I've interacted with, from the salespeople to the financing department. I'd been kicking around the idea of getting an Audi as we needed to trade up from my compact hatchback to a car that can transport more than 2 people comfortably. I was interested in an A4 or an A5, and knew that Audi Chandler had a manual transmission A4 on the lot. I walked in on a Friday with about 15-20 minutes of free time before dinner and worked with Jorge to take a look at the interior and exterior of the two models. Before I left, I told Jorge that I would likely be back in on Saturday or Sunday for a test drive and he didn't pressure me at all.

I came back on Sunday and worked with Adora (turns out, Jorge wasn't working that day) and she let me test drive the manual A4 as well as an automatic A4 with no problems. I wasn't expecting to walk out on Sunday with an Audi, but Adora worked with me to get the deal I was looking for and that was that.

The whole process was pretty painless and I really didn't feel pressured, cornered, intimidated, uncomfortable, etc. throughout the better part of my afternoon. Nobody likes to spend the whole day at the dealership, but if I had to choose one, this would be a good choice.",2

I love the fact that it's a walk in clinic, yes sometimes the wait can be a bit long. However, I get to meet so many interesting people and their pets.

Our kitten had an accident in her carrier and Jason, who is one of the techs, took it back and cleaned it and her off for me. 
The prices are great, too! 
They aren't overcharging for anything. They're charging for the procedure and that's it. I have actually asked them how they make money.

They had a locker for my purse which was nice, and took my coat for me.

I asked for 3-4 inches cut, and told her that I was nervous about it (I've had some bad cuts elsewhere in the past), and she got right to it and went nice and slow and kept checking with me to make sure length was what I wanted.  She was quick and efficient and did exactly what I had asked for and wanted!

WHEN: They are still fairly new, so I believe they are testing out their hours as of the last time I've gone there.

WHY: If you need a break from all that studying, if you need a place to study, if you want to meet a friend and chitchat, if you're for some reason thirstier than normal, if you want to try something new, or if you just want to be there!

WHAT: I am so glad that there is now a boba cafe directly across the street from school! There are times where I crave a nice, cold boba drink and I now can fulfill my cravings and run across the street (of course looking both ways before crossing) and obtaining that delicious drink!

Both times I walked into the place, it was slower than I was expecting (probably because the times I've been there were both after 6pm). However, every time I stepped foot, I was delightedly greeted!! The workers there are so friendly! You can actually converse with them! =). They strictly had boba drinks only, but their menu stated other.

From creative drinks to an entertaining menu to multiple different events per week, it seems like you'd rarely get bored here. Having only been twice, I am not sure if the food is as unmemorable as some other reviews say, but we personally enjoyed both dining experiences, one as a Sunday brunch buffet and the other a late night dinner. The star of the brunch for us was the eggs Benedict as well as the hash station, and we found ourselves refilling several times. 

For our second visit we ordered tacos and a pork shank special. Both came with vegetables that were grilled nicely--some were pretty much burnt on the outside but those were easy to take out, and the rest was super flavorful. The tacos had a crispy tortilla shell and ample fillings, but the pork shank stole the show. Lots of tender meat and super tasty. It was also huge and was more than worth its price.

The building isn't much to look at from the outside, but on the inside they've done well with the set up and you completely forget that you're inside an old car dealership. The interior has a modern yet rustic feel to it, is well lit, and does a good job in trying to get rid of the warehouse-y feel of the building.

There's a great selection of vendors. You can easily find lunch for under $10, maybe even under $5 if you really tried. Grab a cup of coffee or a fruit smoothie and wander from booth to booth. There are many food vendors like Coco Brooks that offer frozen items, kits, or other take-home options so you can enjoy their meals on your own schedule. 

What I really enjoyed was that the KFM is truly about food. There are some, but not an overwhelming number of non-food vendors.

First off, the wait time was friggen ridiculous.  We had 3 of the 4 people in our party present but they would not seat us until the fourth person arrived.  Total wait time was 75 minutes.  They could have seated us and at least we could have had coffee.  I had a 68 year old with us and no courtesy at all was given to her.  What if that fourth person changed their mind.  we would have been waiting for absolutely nothing.  
The food was cold and should have been sizzling for the dish I ordered which was brought on a skillet.  The waitress was great though.
The hostess and manager were totally rude and unprofessional.  I was reading the menu while I was waiting and tapped the hostess on the back of her shoulder to get her attention.  She rudely turned around and snarled at me.  She then told her manager about being hit by myself.  The manger then comes over and say,"" next time, don't hit our worker.""  Totally unprofessional.  If I socked her in her eye, that would be considered hitting.  
The portions were very large which was good.  The taste and quality of the food was not too good.  Egg works on Eastern is far better for cheaper pricing without the 75 minute wait and piss poor attitude hostesses who had attitude problems.

LOCATION
Good location on the corner of a strip mall in between Target and Chase Bank.

DECOR
The decor is clean and the interior is bright and airy with organic colors that give off a relaxed and refreshing feeling.  Perfect if you're looking for a quick, healthy and informal dining experience.

SERVICE
Friendly and caring.  The waitresses were welcoming and efficient while the owners were engaging and helpful in answering questions about the menu.

FOOD
I ordered the Baja Salad with Salmon, Grilled Chicken Tacos, and English Clam Chowder.  The Salad was amazing as the portions were generous and ingredients were fresh!  The Salmon that came with the Salad was from Loch Duart in Scotland (I noticed this on the menu) which is a high quality brand that complemented the Salad well.  The Tacos were tasty as the chicken was tender and moist with a slight char which added to the flavor.  The clam chowder had a good consistency (not too thick or watery) and came in a bread bowl.

OVERALL
The food tasted great, the portions were satisfying (I couldn't finish everything and still had food left over on my plate), the plating (food presentation) was pleasing to the eye, and the prices were reasonable for the quality/quantity.  I am looking forward to returning and trying the other menu items as there is good variety to the selections that should satisfy all appetites!",2

3519,2,1549497600000,"Extremely poor service from the waiter.  All other front of the restaurant staff were professional from the Hostess to the Busboy to the Food Deliverer.

Diners expect more from a restaurant when you are paying over $100 per couple.  I expect a friendly greeting from the Waiter not a ""Are you ready to order?""   With that kind of opening I asked ""Are there any specials for the day?"" knowing full well that there were none.  Gave the idiot a chance to redeem himself by giving him an opening to describe the menu.  Answer.. ""No"" and nothing else.  Strike one!

Meals completed without one visit asking how the meal was going.  Strike two!

Ordered a bottle of sparking water.  The Waiter had opportunities to fill my purposely empty glass when he walked by.  Nope..but he poured wine for the table right next to us when their glasses were empty.  Strike three!

I think Vegas must be having problems finding well trained Wait Staff..this guy would not survive in any other fine dining establishment in a big city.

As for the food, we were satisfied with the quality and presentation.  Just disappointed with the poor wait service.  Note..I should have complained but my Sig Other said not to cause a scene as we needed to head off to a late show.

Avoid this place!",2

For example, celery is usually past its best time (and it's expensive -- $2.99 for a bunch of celery with brown ends??).

When the food came out though was a huge disappointment. I've had katsudon here before and it was really good, which is the reason why I ordered it.

We tried:
- chicken curry
- lamb vindaloo
- ground beef rogan josh
- basmati rice
- naan

The above provided enough food for two full meals plus two small portions of leftovers.

The three curries were all quite flavourful and the meat was generous. I did find the rogan josh a bit oily. The rice was a bit dry but the buttery naan made up for this shortcoming. When asked what spice level we wanted, we said medium not knowing how hot the dishes would be. Next time, I would say hot because there wasn't much heat to be found.

Service was prompt and we appreciated being provided a pitcher of water. With a total bill of $41 before tip, I found the prices a bit high given the portions, but it's not unusual for the area.",2

The food. We happily found out that Wednesday is their chicken special day. I got a spicy fried breast with smoked gouda mac & cheese and rosemary waffles with syrup.

Our service was just okay. Server Seemed a little bit distant and disorganized. Our whole dining experience took a bit longer than the usual lunch time bite. 

Food was okay. Asked for no onions but got onions in my salad and not on my sandwich (does that make sense?). We both ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. Comes with salad or fries and is topped with guac, coleslaw, and sweet chilli sauce. The sandwich just tastes like honey. Definitely tastes better with hot sauce to neutralize how sweet it was.

A few people sitting down at the tables but doors were open for some ""Fresh"" air but it was kind of hot inside. 

On the menu, it says Chamango is $5.95 without any signs for size. When i had ordered, the guy asked if i wanted a small or large, large being the more popular one. So i opt'ed for a large, thinking it was like 1 or 2 dollars more. The total ended up at $10.35. WTCRAP !? Ok i know im not mexican nor do i know what im walking myself into but damn thats one hell of an upcharge o.o ! the picture looks like a large. When i got my order, large pieces of mango with 2 scoops of mango ice cream topped with a ton of the chamoy syrup. No not everything lightly covered... i literally had a measurable cup amount of chamoy syrup. The mango is unripe but crunchy. Not sure if thats the way they prefer it but its similar to what is preferred in viet dishes. The ice cream is a bit icy but was not overly sweet. Not sure if it was the chamoy syrup that screwed up my tastebuds lol... better to get 2 normal chamangos than 1 large probably.

Bana and I met up for holiday hugs with a side of lunch. Did I ever mention that Bana LOVES Mexican? Because she truly does. 

Their homemade salsa and salsa verde were good, as were their guacamole and hot sauce.

Additionally, Yadira was our server and she was so welcoming and attentive. When visiting Grimaldi's on S. Rainbow years ago, I remember they had no ranch dressing. I thought by now this would have changed but no bueno. This was actually why we were leaning more towards CPK, but decided to dine at Grimaldi's since it had been a while. As  a business decision, maybe this franchise would consider offering ranch since by now they have probably lost alot of revenue by not doing so. It was inconvenient to have to walk over to Johnny Rocket's for a side of ranch that so many like to eat with their pizza. Other than that, we had a great experience and we were highly satisfied with the pizza quality and service. Mr. Grimaldi, please introduce ranch dressing on your menu so we can visit you more often.

Inside, it looks like a typical seafood joint, like a Joe's Crab Shack or similar design. It's very open and the tables are well spaced, so you still have a bit of privacy when it gets full and loud. The server was pretty friendly, even for a casual place. Sure, it's not white glove service, but you shouldn't expect that from a casual place like this.

I started with the hush puppies. They were so good. Light like air, salty, and served with a great Cajun dipping sauce. I ordered two pounds of crab legs. They were well cooked and seasoned appropriately. Served with traditional drawn butter, potatoes, and corn on the cob. The coolest thing ever is that they serve it with plastic gloves. Such a good idea for crab legs to prevent your hands from smelling like butter for the next week or so. The crab is served in a plastic bag, which is unique too.

My room literally smelled sour.  Like someone spilled something that wasn't properly cleaned.  The shower was terrible with water just barley warm enough to tolerate.  Asked for a new room and was told that one wasn't available until the following night.  When I did get a new room, the results were similar to my previous room.  Compared notes with the 4 others I was traveling with and they also had similar complaints.

The food was below average and way overpriced even for Vegas.  Was in town for business and needed to order room service one evening, Chicken Caesar Salad, Side of Fries, Glass of Wine....$51.35 before tip.

I usually get the turkey pesto panini which comes with cranberries inside. Delicious. They have good fries here too, so I get that as my side.

My friend ordered a full rack and I had the pulled pork sliders with fries on the side.

The ribs were very dry and very hard to bite into. It was almost like they'd been kept for a while and then just reheated on the grill. There wasn't any sauce mopped on them, just real dry. The pulled pork sliders came cold, and the buns were whole wheat and totally not fresh at all. I could live with the buns not being fresh but having them arrive cold was a total turn off.

And here's the kicker, this is what real pissed me off...there were 2 pieces of hard green flake in the fries, in size about 1cm. Ishowed my buddy and he said it was some kind of dried paint chipped off something. When I held it, I tried to break it in half with my fingers and couldn't. I suspect it came off a skillet or something with a painted surface that's chipping.

A not so critical request is to lower the volume on the rap/ R'nB music or put on a radio station that's oriented to the clientele rather than the 17 yr old female helper behind the counter working there.

My friend got the Croque Special Sandwich...def. want to try next time I visit!

Finally made it here a couple of weeks ago during Art Walk.

Everyone else who wrote reviews said that they were encouraged to try samples. I must not have had that person because age just stood there in silence, looking at us the whole time, like she was waiting for us to leave. 

The ginger wasabi was really good but the cap'n crunch seemed just ok to me. The ice cream didn't taste too creamy but maybe they're still working out the best formulas.

3751,1,1549065600000,"There are 2 reasons why the name of this ice cream counter is appropriate:

1. One gets a chill from stepping foot into the Ice Queen neighborhood (if one could even call it that)  of Forest Hill Village
2. the place has ice cream of course

Though Forest Hill Village is not, as indicated above, the friendliest of areas in the city, it is worth going to this ice cream shop, if only for the sole reason that they always have Greg's Roasted Marshmallow on hand.  Greg's has its own venue on Bloor St. but one is not guaranteed that the flavour will be available .

The Village Chill also has a variety of waist watchers' options and that wacky Asian ice cream made up of hail sized balls.

I ordered my steak medium rare and got medium but I was ok with this. The food was good...would I pay full price for this dinner, no, but for the price it was worth it.

3768,2,1550966400000,"Irene V's brother was visiting, so she threw an hh (happy hour) UYE yesterday afternoon.  I arrived earlier straight after my massage session in Tempe and was starving, so I decided I'd eat early so that I would be free to perhaps enjoy a cocktail and enjoy everyone's company at the UYE.  It was my first time visiting, as I was not able to join the OYE (official yelp event) held here last year.

I sat at the bar and was tended to by manager Chris, who had worked at neighbor and sister restaurant Notorious Burgers.  I ordered the Yelp check-in free appetizer of Crispy cuttlefish, which normally cost $12, as well as the Pappardelle and smoked chicken (I'm sensitive to most seafood and almost all of the standard shellfish offerings).  I would've tried one of the four desserts (three here at Cuttlefish, and one from NB) that intrigued me, but all contained a corn ingredient, or two, so I was spared the calories and expense- thanks, Cuttlefish!  :)

Crispy cuttlefish, originally $12, free on Yelp check-in:  Your basic battered strips of calamari, coupled with an uninspired dip of what resembled tartar sauce.  Glad it was free, because I only ate a strip, or two.  Quite disappointing, as I had expected a dish that incorporated the restaurant's name in its moniker would have to be very special.  Despite its name, the strips weren't crispy at all; the textures of both batter and the squid pieces were unexciting; not much flavor to the batter coating; the whole dish had a strong ""fishy"" scent that was off-putting; and the lemon twists I'd requested to spice things up a bit had not improved matters.  I say skip it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuttlefish-scottsdale?select=3Fk7L3Pu-OlVhq9qe55bHA#3Fk7L3Pu-OlVhq9qe55bHA

Pappardelle and smoked chicken, $12 on happy hour menu, yet was charged $9**:  Oh, my!  This was a winner!  The Alfredo sauce was seasoned just perfectly- rich, creamy, and buttery; the wide pappardelle ribbons cooked al dente; and the smoked chicken was indeed smoky in flavor and added a great texture to the entire dish.  The portion was a little smaller than what a lunch portion would be, yet I ate about two-thirds of this dish, whereas if this was lunch, I'd have eaten around half at the restaurant and taken the rest home.  I suppose my lack of enthusiasm for the free app caused me to overindulge with the pasta, but I'm not complaining!  I'd order it again. Oh, and I'd eat this dish even if the smoked chicken was not included- so delightful!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuttlefish-scottsdale?select=kN-OWUKbqYmfSrhcCwTJrA#kN-OWUKbqYmfSrhcCwTJrA

I paired both dishes with a glass of the Arizona offering of white wine.  Not something I'd enjoy sipping on its own, but I thought was good with the pasta and cream sauce. 

Make sure to check your receipt to ensure that you aren't billed for the free app with Yelp check-in.  Kudos to the staff that watched over our UYE group!  Oh, and thanks to Chris for walking over to Notorious Burgers to grab a sample of Woodchuck Blueberry ale- it was delicious!  Chris said I could order it to enjoy in Cuttlefish should I want it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cuttlefish-scottsdale?select=0lvoYlJ9etu5OkpRvIcbjQ#0lvoYlJ9etu5OkpRvIcbjQ

3797,3,1549670400000,"You know, I've always been conflicted about trying this place. On one hand, Bobby Flay has annoyed me ever since he offended Morimoto on Iron Chef. On the other hand, I really like southwestern style food, and he's supposedly good at coming up with versions of it. 

So there we were, my boyfriend and I, in Vegas a little earlier than expected because we made most of the drive ahead of time to avoid a snowstorm. In fact, we were here in time for lunch (instead of just to St. George). We couldn't decide what to do with our extra meal, so we moseyed into Caesar's and were greeted by the Mesa Grill. We were curious, so we went in. 

It was Saturday afternoon, and therefore brunch time, so my boyfriend started with a mimosa. However, I couldn't resist our waiter's suggestion of one of the margaritas. I can't remember what they called it, but it was as smooth as he said it was supposed to be. I don't usually like margaritas, but I was down with this. 

For our entrees, Alan got the Spicy Scrambled Eggs and I got the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad. Both were very good. The chicken in the salad was perfectly seasoned, and the dressing and goat cheese complimented it nicely. The eggs also had a good amount of goat cheese, and the combination of spices gave a great unique flavor. The ham the accompanied the dish was probably the highlight, though. 

Service was pretty slow, but our waiter was very nice when he did come by. Prices were high, but it's Vegas. 

I guess I'll forgive Bobby Flay for his Iron Chef ills for now (it's been long enough, right?), and I'll even go as far to say that I'd love to try this place for dinner sometime.",2

Their other food is good too.  My friends and I once came and ordered only appetizers, and they were all great.

The only reason they arent getting a 5 star from me is because I think their pizza could use some work.  The one time my friend ordered a Buffalo Chicken Pizza, and it was probably the worst pizza I ever had.

The outdoor lounge has nice plush furniture to sit on and relax, it would be a fantastic place to take a date!

Their wine list is nice, I was sad they didn't have a moscato on it however the Reisling was really good so I couldn't complain. 

My husband and I always have the Pepperoni and Mushroom Pizza wherever we go. It was really good, Just the right amount of sauce and toppings and I have to save the left overs were really good cold. (Breakfast of champions right there)
We also ordered Hot Wings and Teriyaki wings. Its a good thing I love my husband or I may have bit him for the Teriyaki wings, there were fantastic and I could have made a meal out of them by themselves.

3807,2,1549238400000,"Visual calmness is best to describe the overall décor. Personally the décor is just as important as to building genuine client relationships and having an option to use organic products. The windows throughout the 'cottage' invite sunshine in and eye view to an outdoor garden. I for one normally love a modernized/ industrial look that most salon/spas exemplify, but my ultimate goal is to relax and get 'Pampered. Industrial décor does not set this mood.   

The owner Meghan is a real gem. I have been a client for about two years (back when her boutique/salon was located on Alma School Road).  Primarily I receive manicures and pedicures. Recently I started going to her as my colorist. Please see my review on Verde Salon in Chandler. That particular review will explain how pampered pinkie became the spot to get my hair services as well. 

The boutique inside salon offers great gifts for all occasions. The set up flows naturally. You can find frames, jewelry, pillows, and trinkets for the home such as family wall and window ceil quotes to name a few. Coffee and Tea is complimentary. Love it!!!

After my experience at Verde Salon, I felt very nervous about seeking out a new colorist. As for most women (understandable) their hair and nails are like canvas. I don't wear too much makeup and therefore having beautiful and healthy hair is very important to me. I absolutely love Organics Color Systems which is a non-toxic, environmental friendly color line. This is the same color line that Verde Salon uses. I support businesses that are environmentally conscious. 

Meghan did an exceptional job filling in previously missed areas at which my husband noticed a real big difference. My husband is NOT into details...Meghan did wonders! She truely cares and listened to my concerns prior to service. She knew I was anxious but did not take this personally. 

Pampered Pinkie salon does have special/discounts available. I was not aware. A major discount purchased through a third party is what led me into Verde Salon.  Discounts are not always better...especially if overall service is to up to par.  Lesson learned.

Simply put: I am not a hater. I am sure there are good stylists at Verde Salon...but why book through them if you can experience something even better???

3856,1,1550016000000,"Ok, let's get real: weight loss is pretty damn hard.  I had gained a lot of weight due to different factors and had finally HAD IT.  Luckily, my insurance (Teachers Health Trust) has a program that helps pay for the services at Premier Physicians Weight Loss.  I decided to try it.

Fact: even with my insurance helping, this is still an expensive journey you will embark on.  I had to pay $50 every two weeks for the visits, plus I had to buy the medication.  But, that actually kind of motivated me more because I was like, ""Damn, I'm paying for this, so I better stick to it.""

Let's talk about the program.  Every two weeks I saw Dr. Alana Mercer, who is really sweet and blunt and honest, and I appreciated that about her.  You weigh in on what looks like a regular scale, but it is pretty much a fortune teller.  The print out that comes out gives not only your weight, but your body fat percentage, the amount of water weight you are holding, your BMI, and how many calories you are burning at rest.  I was amazed by that machine, and it's pretty cool to track the info on it every two weeks.

Dr. Mercer prescribed me Phentermine to help with the weight loss.  I started low on the 15 mg dose for a month, then upped it to 30 mg the second month.  I also stopped in weekly to get B12/fat burner shots, which I actually think helped more than the pills.  I was on a strict 1000 calorie a day diet, but the combination of the pill and shot made it doable.  I'm not saying this is easy, you really do need to put in your own effort.  It's not like the pill and shot just take all your fat away, but they do help facilitate it.

Results:  I lost 20 pounds in 2 months.  My BMI went from 25.2 down to 22, and my body fat percentage went from 36% down to 28%.  It was amazing.  I feel great and am more confident.  I've been off the pills and shots for a month, and I've been able to maintain my weight.

Though I do not qualify for the pills anymore because I am now in a healthy BMI and body fat range, I think I might go back and buy a shot card to continue to get the B12 shots.  I think those are the magic, right there.",1

I was driving back to Los Angeles from Tucson when I asked my friend if he knew any other place besides Bookmans in Phoenix that carried old video games like NES and SNES. I looked up on Yelp and mentioned a couple of shops, he told me those shops were ok , but if I really wanted to check out a good store with a great selection of games, Fallout Games would be the place. I have to say this place did not disappoint , a great selection was on hand from NES to Atari and more, of course it had all your new titles for XBOX and PLAYSTATION, new and used , but the one thing that stood out was how welcoming the staff was to a first time customer and it seemed every other person that walked in received the same treatment. 
     They were pretty busy, a lot of high school kids and customers bringing in systems and games to trade. I had to wait a bit before I was able to get what I wanted ,but the employee Scot apologized for the whole 5 minutes I had to wait while he and a fellow employee managed the other 10+ customers. haha
        Great guys and great customer service! I pretty much dismiss reviews written by angry kids and people that were upset about ""bad customer service or being ripped off"" You can always tell who the people are just trying to ruin a great stores reputation with a 1 star by complaining about their dirty Game Cube games and their Crimson Skies being turned down or given a small amount of trade for. Bring in good stuff and you will get good offers, stores do not survive by purchasing 100's of copies of Unreal Tournament etc. Also if you are upset about a high price on a item, bring in other stuff to trade, its not that hard, You can't do that on Ebay.
    Also if you call yourself a ""real collector"" as I see so many angry people do, when mentioning Ebay has better prices or ""I can just buy it on Ebay"" makes you stick out as a non collector and speculator , not to mention a sore thumb.
    Go to yard sales and swap meets if you want to find that hidden gem for $5 , which I do every week, but if you want to put all that money you spend on gas into a great independent small business make it a point to stop here. This store is great and everyone that enjoys video games should visit this store.

And the BBQ was pretty sweet as well. We did get to sample some burnt ends, which were great, and made us miss the brisket even more. The pulled pork was solid. The chicken (whole pieces) were excellent too. I personally would like a little spicier sausage, but it was tasty. We shared a 1/2 of ribs which were tasty but slightly less than dropping off the bone perfect.

For sides, the potato salad was great, beans looked good too (didn't try them), mac & cheese was nothing special but not bad, creamy cole  slaw was not my favorite, they offer Carolina style too. 

It sounds like they do some weekly/daily specials which would be great to try out. We finished with a side of 'nanner puddin' which was surprisingly good considering how full we were. 

NBBQ is in a corner spot in a suburban strip mall. Ample parking, easy access from 17, but not a lot of space inside. We enjoyed an outdoor bar table, but the weather was spring perfect. No beer here and I didn't ask if a six pack from the convenience store on the corner or if BYO would have been ok. 

All in all a good meal. Our local friend who was with us will likely be back and if we're in town again, so will we.",2

I love the gorgeous panel art on the north wall and the cute little Tuk Tuks used as drink coolers. It reminds me of our time in Thailand, taking a tuk tuk up the mountain to see the giant Buddha with the whole family. Who needs roller coasters when you have tuk tuks....HA!
I only gave Tuk Tuk Thai 3 stars because the seating is strange. One long table, one small tall table ( with really short stools...I saw a customer eat his lunch here standing up rather than sitting on the stools because it's awkward), and scattered stools are not adequate. We sat at the end of the long table and froze because the only way in is via a sliding door and it was open a lot.

I had the sea bash fish and chips... amazing. Husband had the meatloaf, mouthwatering yumminess. Veggie friend had the tofu enchiladas and scrapped the plate clean.  Oh, we started off with the ribs... goodness.  All of the deserts sounded amazing and super interesting... but we were stuffed and couldn't eat any more. 

All of the servers were excited to tell you about what their favorites on the menu were and were knowledgeable about about the preparations... something that is difficult to find in Pittsburgh area restaurants.

Hmmmmmm.... not sure why she would offer Groupons for her services if she isn't able to book appointments that are convenient for the average consumer?????? Have requested a refund and figure it's her loss for potential repeat business for both me and my boyfriend - we are looking for a good massage therapist in the east valley. A few years ago, I used a Groupon type of discount to try the service of an aesthetician and liked her technique. She's is the northwest valley and I still get monthly facials from her 6 months after moving to East Mesa (and don't intent to change that practice).

We ordered 2 of the large assortment platters where you get a scoop of everything. We ordered injera bread and various drinks. I frankly felt overcharged for scoops of food that were CLEARLY not freshly prepared but froma steam table. Who knows when it was prepared!

Sushi Plus offered a 2 for $9.95 roll offer during happy hour. We tried the unagi roll and the the albacore tuna roll. The flavors were good. However, the unagi roll was rolled a little loose. 

What really intrigued us was the the for broth bases they offered with their ramen: shoyu, pork, spicy chicken and miso. We cannot wait come back and try their ramen. They also offer bibimbap and soonduku.

He said I didn't mention it. Is this a new rule? I can read and it's in plain view. Why should I have to mention it? Then he talks to the cook and tells me that she says it's a special only on Tuesdays but she's going to make it for me. Hmmm... On he door when you walk in there's a piece of paper stating on Tuesdays tacos are a $1. Since my total for two was $4 (and some change) I'm sure that doesn't qualify. I'm just upset that I actually tipped them a dollar (like always) and if I didn't check my bag, would've been cheated on my B2G1 deal! Cmon! It's not rocket science.

The second time, I knew I had to try an actual entree, so I went for the red snapper special.  The mango curry south had just enough heat coupled with sweetness to accentuate the fish, which despite a crispy shell was soft and flaky inside.  The lentils and asparagus were also cooked and seasoned very well.  However, my brother once again made the pick of the day: a peppercorn duck breast appetizer in a cherry sauce (another special) that was scrumptious and juicy, with the cherries not a sugary dessert glaze but an almost savory sauce to bring out the richness of the meat.  My mom always goes for the peppercorn filet, which is one of the house specialties that never fails to disappoint her.

If he can't do a cut/trim in an hour, then he's not good enough.

Edit: In a response from this owner, it has become clear that he dislikes Army veterans due to him being a Marine, and allegedly he served in Desert Storm and Desert Shield so he can make blanket statements about hating other veterans from other branches.

They don't have everything all the time, and sometimes they do sell out of staples but I think that is understandable for a small independent grocery shop offering such a special selection. It's nice to know that they are stocking what is more readily available for the season. I appreciate that even in the winter they offer a good selection of locally made produce and that despite everything being organic and premium, there are still deals to be had!

I had called the day before to make reservations, with a special request for a customized wine tasting.  When we arrived I reminded them that we wanted a customized flight.  There were no notes on our reservation, and apparently the guy that handles those requests was not there.  We were asked if we could wait 10-15 minutes, and he would arrive and speak with us about what we wanted. No problem!  But...alas, he never came to our table.  Meanwhile, after multiple conversations with a couple of the staff members there, this small request became a big deal.  Finally our waitress mentions that we could choose our own wines for a 2 oz flight from a limited list of wines.  WHAT?!?!  That's what we wanted.  What is wrong with this picture?  I said that was great, and we wanted the wine before or with lunch....not after.  Well, lunch was served, and no wine.  It took so darn long, that I had to get up in the middle of eating and find out what was going on.  It was very stressful.  We finally got the wine, but the whole experienced was soured by that point.  Just really ridiculous for a place whose business centers around wine.",2

This location is notorious FOR SCREWING UP YOUR ORDER. It's a running joke at work and with friends. Check your bag, check your bag. If you use coupons, prepare for a fight if you go into the store. Assistant managers seem incapable of making even the most basic of decisions so if the coupon doesn't spell things out step by step, they will become confused and refuse a simple accommodation like ""Green sauce instead of red"".

There was a Taco Bell right in the same parking lot, it was heaven to have them both side by side.

Finished off with freshly frosted coconut cupcakes. It looked like a good place for lunch, pretty quiet for dinner.


Second Day..

This cannot compare to picnic garden back in nyc, where the meat portions are bigger, squid is fresher, and other options to grill as well (foodwise).
However, this place is cheap for an AYCE restaurant. Until tips and tax racked it up to $21.45. -_-
The kimchi tasted funny. Still edible, I guess. The beef, ribs and salmon were the only things I really liked. Squid tasted kinda fake . They give really small portions at a time, so it's really annoying to keep having to fill out the slip.
Customer service wasn't all that great either. Yes, it might have been busy but we asked them to change our grill, and they never did. The waiter also gave us dirty looks for giving them more slips. It's AYCE, what do you expect us to do? Not eat?

On 5/5/18 (63,811) front brakes needed to be completely replaced as the rotors we ruined from me driving on them one afternoon with no break pads left.
WHY WAS I NOT TOLD MY BRAKES NEEDED TO BE DONE WHEN I JUST PAID YOU OVER $700 TO SERVICE MY CAR!!!!!  YOU PEOPLE ARE IN TOO BIG A HURRY TO MAKE A BUCK!!!
That being said I took my car to Centennial Hyundai to give them the business.  My breaks cost $964 to do the front and rear with new rotors.  This could have been a $664 service had Henderson Hyundai looked at my brakes when my car came in and I wouldn't have had to spend another $300 on front rotors.
DONT GO TO HENDERSON HYUNDAI!!!!",2

I admit, I do come as often as once a week sometimes because I cannot get enough of their Butter Chicken.  The lunch special of their Butter Chicken includes the Butter Chicken with your choice of Naan Bread or Rice and a side of salad.  I always end up getting their Naan Bread.. might I add that the piece of Naan they give you is enormous!  I've only come here a few times for dinner service and I have to say that the portion sizes for the lunch and dinner are exactly the same, so I'd rather just come here for lunch rather than paying more for dinner service for the same amount of food.  I think for dinner I've only ever tried their Lamb Tikka the very first time I came, but I wasn't a fan of it as was dry and tasteless.  I have yet to try their Tandoori Chicken, which is probably the only other dish I would try or their Samosas, which I've heard many good things about.  Maybe next time, if I go for dinner service, I will consider trying a new dish.  The customer service here is not always the greatest and really depends on whom is working at the time I go in.  They do not really seem enthusiastic about working there, especially when on the phone.  But I usually call in for take-out and by the time I get to the restaurant the food is ready for me to take home to eat so no complaints there. I highly recommend checking out the lunch specials!

We were excited to get a location in Goodyear and went to try it the other day. The iced kicker was good, however, I watched the guy make it and after filling the cup with ice he poured in a very small amount of liquid and then put in more ice to get the small amount of drink up to the top of the cup. I brought my wife's back to the car and she took a few drinks and her cup was empty and said ""that's all you get?"". I tried to drink mine slowly and I didn't even make it half way home and mine was gone and we only live about five minutes away.

He made the drink in what looked like a 2 cup measuring cup and he only filled it half way up before pouring it in my cup. I think we only got 8 oz of liquid and about 32 oz of ice. I don't remember them being this small in Grants Pass.

We have carpet so we took them off. I really don't think we're the only people in Vegas with carpet! Come on now. They'd take a broken down stroller and try to hustle it out of their store for $30 dollars but not take a like new walker?!? WTF!? That's not it either. They only give store credit for the items you take to sell and only during the week, while their website specifically says that they BUY on the weekends too. All in all, coming here was a waste of my time. Their clothes are ok but the gear is over priced for the shoddy condition you find them in. The first time I came the owner was arguing with a customer trying to return something WITH A RECIEPT saying that the broken toy did not come from her store.

4079,2,1551139200000,"One of the better galleries I've been in in a long time. It has that true small, local, independent artist gallery feel not a museum feel if you understand what I mean. There are two galleries. One on Cleveland's bridges, watched over by the original building's crane, and one with random photos. While the random collection of photos themselves are cool it's how they were created that is really interesting. For that information view the info on each picture on your iPhone (via QR reader or supplied website), paper guide, or on the Kindle Fire the gallery will lend you for free (bring your driver's license). Definitely a cool space. I can't wait to see what will come next (around 24 May I think). Two different shows in 6 months, then CMA gets a go at the space. 

What else was really cool is that co-owner Laura Ruth Bidwell was there and I got to meet her!

And also, don't miss the sizable parking lot! I never expected something in this area to have it's own parking lot so I completely didn't see it and parked free on the street.

I never had this annoying experience in vegas before with other hotels,

FIRST ,
They Charged me almost $600.00 (originally $139/night) for staying friday-sunday,
and arguing some b/s over the phone that it is some security deposit or whatever. IM TELLING THAT ITS CLEARED through my bank account, NOT PENDING !!!this girl in the front desk doesn't understand the meaning of being CLEARED in bank account. She just hung up by saying the supervisor will call you again, and still no reply for couple hours. How hard is it to just calculate 139.00x2 +taxes+RESORT FEE?  or is the resort fee almost $300? so annoying. omg.

The rooms were not even nice for that price. The resort smelled like full of cigarrette, 
and the overall resort just felt like some local casinos.

We ordered corned beef hash with wheat toast and eggs benedict, firm.  The food came in a reasonable time.  And it was ok.  The server asked if it was too our liking.  As meals go, it was good.  Not memorable or ravingly great, just good.

4095,3,1550361600000,"This review is coming from someone who is very nervous about doctors/dentists/having anything done to me that could slightly be painful. Hopefully it helps someone who is the same way. After a few years of really wanting Laser Hair Removal, but being scared of the pain/cost, I finally took the plunge. I decided to try Simplicity after seeing my friends results (she's been getting laser hair removal here for 2+ years).

Getting the treatment/pain level-
I was very wary of trying laser because I am a huge baby with a low pain tolerance level. Yes, the treatment is painful, but it is manageable. The pain feels like a hot rubber band snap, and only lasts less than a second. It is more noticeable on places with thicker hair (lower legs, arimpits, etc). During your treatment, they recommend you buy a ""desensitizing gel"". For $26 you get a tiny 1 oz bottle of Lidocaine cream. Took me a 2 second search on Amazon to find a 4oz bottle of Lidocaine cream fro $12. I won't be making the mistake of buying the cream from Simplicity anymore! 

Customer service- 
Making your first appointment: To make your initial appointment/start your service, you have to buy the package online. I was kind of put off by this at first because I would have liked to discuss different options/packages with someone, but I guess it could be a good thing to avoid sales pitches. After reading other reviews I thought that I had to be wary of being up-sold, but this wasn't the case at all. I called the number to ask how to start, and was told to buy package online, so I did. One year unlimited for $999. Not a bad price I think, for what you're getting. 
Calling to reschedule/get questions answered: Something worth knowing about Simplicity is that YOU CANT CALL THEM DIRECTLY. Every time you call to reschedule an appointment/have any questions answered, any number you find will take you to their corporate call center and they filter your needs from there (the call center isn't based in Vegas, so you always have to start the conversation with ""Hi i'm a client at the Anthem location in Henderson, NV""). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the ladies on the phone are always very nice/handle rescheduling efficiently and quickly. But it's hit or miss on how long you wait on hold to talk to one of them. One day I listened to the on hold music for 20+ min. Most of the time they pick up right away. 
People working at the office: The ladies working at the office are all nice, but some are more warm and friendly than others. This inconsistency is a little annoying. One day you will have someone performing the treatment who is very nice, warm, helpful, and makes you feel at ease, and the next time you will get someone who is pleasant, but kind of terse. Overall they are nice and are attentive, they ask if you are comfortable and will even suggest turning the laser down if they can tell you are in pain. I am always seen right at my appointment time and am in and out quickly. 

Overall I would recommend Simplicity- mostly due to the awesome results.

UPDATE: You can call them directly but you have to get their direct number from one of the front desk people.",2

4110,2,1549929600000,"In Yelp friends I trust. It was in Yelp friend Momo. B's pics, check-in comments, and review that created a mental balloon that said ""You have to China Wan Wan.""  In the near future I'd pop that mental balloon when I stepped inside China Wan Wan. I'd end up liking it so much that I would return a couple of more times. 

   China Wan Wan is in a small strip mall at the southwest corner of Boulder Highway and Russell Road. It is not a stand alone Chinese restaurant. It is a small Chinese restaurant in back of the Popeyes Chicken. 

   The lunch specials are a fantastic deal. They start out at $5.95 and top off at $6.55. The shrimp based entrees are the highest priced ones. A Coke beverage brings the price up to around $8. The lunch specials include a cup of soup. They are served in a styrofoam  plate with the entree, fried rice, and soft chow me in noodles. Before they serve the food to your table, you can look into the open kitchen to watch them make the food. To the left of the counter and open kitchen is the Coke soda fountain. 

     China Wan Wan is more of the take out environment than a full service casual dining Chinese restaurant like The Lotus or China Bistro for example. Here, there is no visual candy like a Buddha statue, pictures of China,  or place mats of the Chinese New Year. It is a take out atmosphere with sufficient seating. Anyways, the food is the eye candy. 

    On my visits,  I had ordered the peppersteak and shrimp chop suey. The peppersteak was really good. The meat was juicy and tasty. They interspersed it with the right amount of onions and pepper. The shrimp chop suey was also delicious. The shrimp were sufficient in size and portions. The representation of vegetables, mushrooms, sauce, and ingredients complimented the mushrooms. The fried rice was of good quality. The soft chow mein noodles were tasty and far better than what I have tasted at some Chinese restaurants where they are filler food. The choice of the soup that comes with the meal is either egg drop or hot and sour soup. Both are good, however, wonton soup would be great. 

    Friendly people take the orders and bring the food to the table. Everything I have been here, they greeted me right away and were friendly. 

    China Wan Wan is China Win Win. When you dine here before 4 pm, you come up winning with delicious Chinese food and Coke for less than Panda Express. I am sending you the reader a mental balloon that says ""If your in the mood for a good Chinese lunch special when your in the vicinity of Boulder Highway and Russell Road give China Wan Wan a try."" I think it will be worth popping that mental balloon and experiencing China Wan.",2

The cons: bed was a bit hard, room decor a bit outdated, the hotel is off the strip (15 minute cab ride), $8 per person fee for shuttle that is supposed to pick up at 5 after every hour, but skipped our 7:05 pm pick up (we were outside waiting 15 minutes before), although they stated they came by.

The one drawback logistically is the sign/menu placement.  The descriptions of the sauces are around the corner where you cannot see them while ordering.  I am not sure what good that does anyone.  I would rather see the menu with prices first, if anything, so I can start to narrow down my selections before the food comes into view.

I will probably be back, and would give 4 stars if it were a little cheaper.  $7+ for a pita, and and extra $3 for a side and drink just seems out of line with the prices at other fast-casual places in this area.",2

My hubby and I sat in one of the private, two-person booths. I loved that we could adjust our own lighting, and the booths had high sides so you could not see anyone around you.

We decided to try the Big Night Out Americana (Fondue Fusion) meal, at $89 per couple and including a cheese fondue appetizer, salads, a selection of meats and seafood (including a lobster tail), and chocolate fondue. For first-timers, it's a great way to try the fondue experience. But it was a LOT of food. Too much, really. I think the next time we will order items separately and skip the cheese fondue, since it was kind of heavy and our least favorite of the selections.

We are much better at gauging the doneness of items than we were 15 years ago, but this is the one thing that prevents me from giving Melting Pot five stars. I mean, your enjoyment of the food is dependent on your ability to cook items correctly yourself. They give you guidance on how long items should cook, but no timers. That would be a nice addition to the tables!

But, I have to say that we enjoyed just about everything we tried. I preferred the lobster, shrimp, and pork, and my hubby preferred the lobster and sirloin. You also get several vegetables and lots of sauces to choose from. I really loved the curry sauce, and used it on just about everything.

Service at Melting Pot is top notch. Our server was constantly checking on us to see if we needed more drinks, veggies or sauces (sadly, extra lobster was not an option, LOL).

They have full-leaf teas from well-known estates in Assam, and Ceylon, as well as notable Chinese varieties as well. The lady who helped me out today was pretty knowledgeable about the differences in Ceylon teas. I won't claim to be a full-bred tea connoisseur myself but I'm getting a lot of enjoyment out of my trips to Nicholas. Plus they're also stocking local honey as well which is a huge plus.",2

4210,2,1550275200000,"The only reason it's getting two stars is because the kids had fun playing in the arcade otherwise no stars would be given. The service started out great. We were the only diners that day. We were a large party of ten. Two families. When we asked for two separate checks the waitress rolled her eyes and and gave ""the sigh"". The food was average. I ordered a medium well burger and it came medium rare.  I ate it. My friends daughter had chicken tenders that were more like burnt rocks. I cant believe they were let out of the kitchen let alone served.  This we did complain about and Chrissy,our waitress, didn't want to take care of it and after some push finally decided to have it remade. But since the child had eaten some of the fries from the first order she wasn't given any on the remake.  The second order was slightly less than burned but more edible. The waitress loomed over our table clearing dishes as soon as she felt we should be done. Now remember this is an arcade setting so the kids got up to play more games the adults were still eating but the waitress thought we should be done and we get the bill. Four people 75.00.  Gratuity had been added to our bill but the waitress failed to inform us.  My friends bill had all these up charges. She was charged twice for pizza toppings,and after pointing it out to the waitress and some hemming and hawing from the waitress, she took off the extra charges still making an 8 inch pizza over 16.00. Serves one adult! We sat at our table for nearly an hour while the kids were playing in the arcade and were completely ignored by our waitress. The waitress did come back to the table but only  to clear some glasses.  Sadly the place was near empty when we got there for lunch and completely empty after we left at 3:30.  There are many better choices out there for fun and games!  won't be returning",2

After ordering eggs and turkey bacon, and a skillet, we got the banana nut muffin. It was warm and was a nice touch. The rest of the food was were it starts to get bad. The potatoes were heavily seasoned for a breakfast dish but that could just be a preference. The turkey sausage looked like flat lumps of mushed meat- tasted as described. 

But here's were it gets the worst for me, the price was 25 dollars and some change. In my opinion, go down the street a ways to Tivoli Village, Leone Cafe and eat a beautiful meal, in a gorgeous atmosphere, for the same price. The quality of food at Egg Works was not worth it. Luckily we had a coupon. Still, would have chosen the other breakfast spot over Egg Works.

4248,3,1549584000000,"It is true - this place is expensive.

This is the kind of place where you buy gifts and treats for the out-of-towners visiting or to bring to your friends from somewhere else. They package everything so very nicely and have their pretty sticker on everything and have a nice bag, etc. i.e. the presentation of their treats is very excellent. 

But to come here a lot to just binge and indulge for yourself - it gets very very expensive... I've done it, though, and I do encourage you to visit this place to try some of their treats! They are quite good.

Chocolates - I think they make them here. They all look very much like works of art. Each little ball looks like it is special. They do taste good. The white one has brown stuff in it, and is not as good as the other ones in my opinion, but that is just a taste-thing. When I eat their truffles, I feel like I am eating my money away quite quickly. (But really, money doesn't taste as good as these things anyway)

Pastries - Pretty and not cheap. Both mille feuilles are great, but I'm not a connoisseur of million-feuilles, so that is my humble opinion. Tarts delicious

Cookies/breads - Very good and fresh

Food - overpriced! Don't go here to eat! Seriously. I have not yet eaten something here that I would ever eat again, although I have eaten 'real' food here too. 

I have found the staff here very nice and helpful.

There are these little pretty squares in the refrigeration section that are like mini cakes. I was going to get them, but they were $20. Ouch. 

Summary - when you go crazy on a food binge, your wallet will feel it. It is a great place to get gifts for others' because there food looks so pretty, is packaged so elegantly, and tastes very good. Not for the struggling student to go to regularly. You'll be fat AND broke.",2
4252,3,1550102400000,"Went here a few years ago when it was more tapas style for dinner and thought it was ok.  But now that ive relocated to phx went back to try the brunch. 

Let me start with - i really enjoy Gallo Blanco. Id say that spot is one of those restaurants you can always go to and be satisfied. So i like the pedigree that Otro comes from. 

Two words describes my experience: amateur hour. 

Went with a party of 8. Called ahead and when we got there the restaurant was maybe half full.  Server didnt seem with it.  For example. A majority of us ordered coffee. We would finish. Then one of us would ask for a refill. He would then refill the one cup, then disappear.  Why didnt he ask if anyone else needed more? Another example. One of our party oreered hot tea. Brought a dirty mug. Told him - honest mistake - came back with a copper mug for a moscow mule.  Welp. Hot drink. Copper cup. Not possible to hold. That information didnt really register with him when we tried to explain.  He was more focused on the fact that it was clean. 

Anyways. We ordered chilaquiles and tortas and pancakes and huevos rancheros. Literally took 45 minutes.  Pancake came out undercooked and room temp. Not to mention a sad spot where a pad of butter USED to be.  Huevos rancheros also room temp. Side of beans were hard crusted on top. Basically tells me it was sitting in the window for awhile. The chilaquiles were fine. Torta was ok. 

Overall a dissappointing experience. Server was more work for us. Food was a bummer. 

Oh well. I dont recommend this place.",1

4261,3,1549756800000,"This is the best and most authentic Mexican food I've had in Calgary.

My friend Toni has been raving about this place to me for a while (read her 5-star review) and on a nice, hot, sunny Friday afternoon we hit up their patio. I started with a michelada. They make a fantastic michelada. It's probably the spiciest one I've had and they use the correct rimmer to crown the drink. After my spicy beer drink was done, my friend and I split a pitcher of sangria. The pitcher was a great refreshing drink to sip on the patio in the afternoon sun.

To go along with our drinks we had an order of chips and guac. The chips were lightly salted and the guac was nice and chunky. I like a chunky guac so you can actually tell what's in it and enjoy the individual flavours. I always cringe at a place that serves you a smooth green paste and calls it guac. Nothing suspect about the guac here, it was very flavourful and hit the spot.

For my meal I went with the Al Pastor tacos. They were bang on. The pork was nice and tender, full of flavour, and just the right amount of pineapple. They has a few salsas on the table to try. While I'm not sure which was which, all three brought their own unique aspect to the dish. The four tacos were packed full and were a great portion size for the price.

To cap off the afternoon my friend and I each had a mojito. Again, a well made drink. The mint was fresh and there was no hint of wilting. This one didn't last long on the table before I sipped it down.

Despite the place being packed and a line forming on the sidewalk, the service was great. Our server came by often enough to check on us, but wasn't overly intrusive. The drinks were kept flowing and our food came at a good pace. Great job overall.",2

Me and my husband stroll down this sketchy part of town on a Saturday morning to the Ontario Bistro and each order a usual, 3 eggs any style (I like mine scrambled) 3 sausage or bacon, 2 thick sliced toast, and fried potatoes.

4292,1,1549324800000,"I'm torn over how I feel about Ichi Ban; I love it for its atmosphere and flavor, but every time I look at their menu (and my subsequent bill) I am constantly reminded that I am not loved in return. It's heartbreaking.

For what they charge for sushi, I want to see the pond where the sushi chef spears the fish himself. 

I give Ichi Ban props for making their waitresses wear kimonos. Not to sound like a total bitch, but I find it most distressing when I go into an ethnic restaurant and find everyone dressed like the jerkoff at the Verizon Store. It just seems really suspicious to me; like they expect me to put faith in their culture's cuisine but don't even bother to dress the part. Don't mind me. I'm just obsessed with aesthetics.

Oh, Ichi Ban always plays authentic Japanese music while you get your sushi on. Which I appreciate. Nothing would ruin a plate of tuna rolls like having to listen to Linkin Park while I eat.

If you have a sadomasochistic relationship with your wallet (or manage to hook up with one of the many ""money is no object, but it's all I think about"" types that are springing up all over our once nice and ghetto west side), the food is pretty damn yummy. 

I recommend the Tempura, the Boat, and any of the sushi combos.

Try the Philadelphia Roll if you don't have an aversion to cream cheese. 

Don't bother getting a soda. Get the iced green tea. It only costs a dollar and is amazing. 

If you want dessert, I suggest you venture across the street to any of the corporate chains. I rarely advocate going chain over local, but for the love of Zeus, 3 dollars for TWO BALLS OF MOCHI? 

You get six mochi in a box of Trader Joe's Mochi Balls for about the same price.

Usually when someone wants to screw you over like that they have the common decency to give you their phone number.

Ichi Ban is a good one-time or maybe once-a-month treat. But for those with a budget, I'd suggest any of the lesser known and less expensive alternatives.

And no, I'm not talking about Kyoto Bowl.

From the start of the process he answered all my questions and was able to come out quickly to mount several of our TVs. They were professional, flexible, friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable.

We highly recommend this company and are very happy with the service we got.",2
4457,3,1550188800000,"Holy Priscilla Queen of the Dessert Folks!  

Let me be very clear, this is a boutique of women's clothing but for men. It is just brimming with every tranny's clothing, makeup and accessory desire.  There are the best strapping long boots in an assortment of designs and colours with I swear 5 inch heels (look at my photos).  There is also some great shit kicking heels that with make you tower over everyone when you go out and flaunt what you got.  And keep in mind they will have the bigger sizes so you won't be disappointed.

An assortment of great wigs, long and short in every colour line one wall of the store, and they have a great little area for the bangles and bling that will just make your outfit sing.  

Another impressive thing amongst many here at DevaDave is that they carry Ben Nye makeup which is high quality entertainment makeup which does not irritate your skin and is super hypoallergenic.  So you go girl and lip sync your heart out to that Kylie Minogue song.

Dave the owner was upstairs in his beauty salon working which is on the second floor level of this location so basically he came down greeted me with a hug and told me to make myself at home and went sauntering back up the stairs.

I love this shop and they also have a great assortment of rainbow propaganda to wave it ""proud"" girls and boys.",2

I understand there is an event on a daily basis where the main venue is but for those of us visiting for the first time and sitting in the dining area, we are being walked by like we dont exist.

Definitely worth a visit though!",2
4490,3,1549756800000,"The front desk staff were helpful and very professional, the bell desk staff have also been quick and helpful. The room seems clean thankfully and the view is nice. 

I'm staying here for 8 nights on a work trip though and it's been incredibly frustrating. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant or food options in it and the room service ends at 2 in the afternoon, except on weekends. I was on hold for 15 minutes for room service once before calling the front desk and being put straight through. The next time, I was on hold for 40 minutes and eventually had to give up and find a pizza delivery place who could bring me dinner, as I was stuck working in my room. I ordered breakfast one day and the fruit plate arrived with the plastic still on it (and thank goodness, because otherwise I wouldn't have seen the sticker which showed it was already 2 days past it's expiry date). 

I organised to have a package sent to me at the hotel but USPS just told me that it was rejected by the hotel (?!) and so I'm having to find the time away from work to organise picking it up. 

Generally, it's just been very frustrating and I've lost time that I needed to spend on working, just to figure out how to find dinner that isn't fast food from the nearby Miracle Mile mall. 

Would not stay again.",2
4502,3,1550880000000,"My parents and I flew in from New York to visit Montreal. There was a gentleman outside the restaurant encouraging people to come in. At first, this gave the impression of a seedy restaurant. However, once inside we found Mister Steer to be an old-fashioned style diner. The restaurant had delicious hamburgers (with small patties) and suzy Q fries. The fried fish and chips (fries) were cooked well also. Very crispy and flavorful. We also tried poutine for the first time in Mister Steer.

The waiting staff was very nice and accomodating as well. Mister is a good go-to spot for lunch and/or dinner.",2
4507,1,1550534400000,We came here as a date night on a Saturday night for a 6 PM dinner.  I'd originally only been able to get a bar seat but when they called the day before they were able to accommodate for a regular table.  The restaurant was unassuming from the outside.  We were seated immediately and our server was prompt.  He was very good at explaining how the menu was and making recommendations.  I asked about their infamous lobster poutine and he told me how after 11 years it came off the menu.  We started with the zucchini salad.  Anytime there's zucchini flower on the menu I am drawn to it.  The flower was stuffed with ricotta and the zucchini salad was very light and refreshing.  Our next appetizer was the spicy jerk crab.  Our server warned us it's super spicy and it was but it was good!  Decent sized legs.  My mouth was on fire lol.  Thankfully they gave us time to get the spiciness out of our mouths.  Then we shared the scallops and pork belly.  This was delicious.  Scallops were very good sized and the charred corn beneath was nice.  Next was the pork tenderloin on cheese grits.  The grits weren't overly cheesy which was good.  The cabbage was very nice.  The overall flavours were great.  We were too stuffed for dessert.  Their bread looked good and the couple beside us was devouring it but we didn't have enough room to have bread to start lol.  Definitely a great dining experience and would definitely go back!  The vibe and food and service were all excellent.  I just wasn't able to pay with my Visa giftcard that I was given as a gift.,3
4531,3,1551312000000,"The only reason we started coming to this place was for their $3.99 steak and eggs (or ham and eggs). You have to get their player's card (ACE) so that you get 10% off of your food bill.  It's a great meal for the price, or actually, at any price.  Once we also added a waffle with whipped cream and strawberries, and it was crispy, yet melted in our mouths. It was sweet enough with the toppings that it didn't require any syrup. 

After eating, we got sucked into staying in the casino for a bit. One friend had heard that the Wizard of Oz slot machine pays off, so we played a bit. It's fun when you get the flying monkey bonus or get to pick your winning credits by choosing emeralds and looking for the four characters to add to your bonus.  

There's also a blackjack table with a bonus bet called lucky lucky where you bet a dollar next to your regular bet, and if your two cards plus the dealer's up card add up to at least 19, then you win at least twice your lucky bet. If your cards plus the dealer's up card is a 6-7-8, you get 50 to 1, and if they're suited, you get more.  It seemed like I would win more on the lucky bet than on the regular bet.

This casino is filled with locals, has a small town feel, and is definitely a change of pace from the fashionable hotel/casinos on the strip. You may see lots of ""characters"" there. That's the best way I can describe what you'll see there.  Try it out.",2
4534,3,1549843200000,"Finally tried Smashburger. Things I enjoyed - 

1. Smash Fries
2. Sweet Potato Fries
3. The Smash Sauce on my juicy burger
4. The Bun - can I get an EGG BUN?! Heck yes!

Things I less than enjoyed
1. The lacy burger patty - meaning, a patty thin enough that you can see though it in parts 
2. TBH- the price to value comparison 
3. The large-ish dying bug on the floor next to my table seen after I was done eating

So, in sum, The burger has some good things going for it - it's got FLAVOR- but I guess I'm not sold on the whole experience.",2

4576,2,1550707200000,Was in the area and planning on stopping by the very small car show in the parking lot near by and parked across the street from this store. The people working here were standing near the entrance here. My fiancé and I were planning on stopping by this place after seeing the car show but before we could even take a step they immediately yelled across the street saying we couldn't park there if we are going to the car show. First off all there was only one other car in the area we parked and easily over twenty five other spots open. Just because you don't want people parking near your store when they are going to a different place doesn't mean you have to be rude and raise your voice at them. The sad part is we were actually going to visit the store and they prevented us from doing so.,1
4579,1,1550448000000,"What a nice hotel! My husband and I were lucky to score a really good deal on a room via hotwire.com and it was our first time staying on the northside of the Strip. We got a strip-view room on the 49th (eep!) floor, and we were immediately impressed as soon as we walked through the door. Everything is plush, from the bathroom to the bed to the closets. One of my favorite things was the TV built into the mirror in the bathroom (I kinda want to get one at home now, it was awesome to be able to watch the news while I got dressed!) The bed was exceptionally comfortable and I loved how all of the bathroom products smelled. One thing to keep in mind if you're planning to stay here is that there is no casino in this hotel, but they do have free shuttles to the Wynn and Caesar's Palace. My husband and I just walked across the street to the Wynn ourselves, but for those who don't want to venture far to hit the slots, the shuttle is the way to go. I highly recommend this hotel to those who want a bit of luxury while staying in Vegas. The Donald runs a fancy place!",2

Today I had a mesquite chicken salad sans tortilla chip shreds.  They kept the chips off (which was sort of surprising to me) and it was pretty good tasting.  
The server offered to split the checks which is nice and the server who brought out the food brought out the checks at the same time in case we were in a hurry.  My drink was kept filled without me having to ask for it and I think everyone else at the table enjoyed everything they were eating. 
We did seem to have to go through a gauntlet of servers, hosts and managers lining the exit on the way out , but overall it was a good experience.",3

4599,2,1550102400000,Went in for the first time this weekend. I really loved the quaint vibe inside. I got the fried green tomato sandwich with Mac n cheese ( SO GOOD!) They also give you cornbread to munch on while you wait. My boyfriend loved the fried chicken. We will go back!,3

We will definitely be back.,1
4613,2,1549238400000,"While the service is very good, the food here is terrible.  My husband and I have eaten amazing Indian food all over North America and absolutely adore it so we were profoundly disappointed after wasting our money on the food at this restaurant.  Good Indian food is a culinary euphoria; incredible taste should be a given.  This food had no flavor.  It was tasteless with tons of heat so it just burned your mouth without any foundation to accompany the heat.  The chicken... akin to wet rubber.  I don't know when I have had chicken with that texture and I'm not sure what you would even do to it to get it like that??  My husband joked and said it must have been frog meat, not chicken!  We left most of the food in its dish and didn't care to even eat what was on the table which NEVER happens; we love food!!  Especially Indian!

The stars are for the service, the food is for the garbage.  Save your money.",2
4615,2,1550016000000,"I stayed here several years ago, but returned this week. I was quite happy. I asked for a quiet room and got one. I always feel like it's a roll of the dice as to who stays in the rooms next to you, but my room was on the end. 

The room was nice, clean and had all the amenities I could want (WiFi, kitchen, good TV). The staff was professional (Mary?) and friendly. 

The breakfast was so-so, with the usual motel free breakfast.

The price was reasonable and that's what brought me back. I had stayed away because I remembered them as pricey, but it was quite reasonable, this time.

I shall return!",3

Not one of them looked in my attic to see what was up there, except for Danny.  In fact he insisted that he go up there.  I told him I had someone tell me it wasn't my duct work that's causing the problems with my air flow and lack of cold air, it was the unit.  He laughed and went up and immediately told me that the problems I've been having all these years is bad duct work from the builder.  He showed me where the builder had put hoses and ducts in that were too short so they were loose and/or kinked so the air wouldn't flow.  I have at least 5 vents that blow very little air and they are the vents connected to these ducts.  The hose from the air handler was kinked so the only cold air we would get is when it was below 95 degrees out side.  Danny is working with us  to correct these problems at a minimal cost.  Thank you Danny, you're the best!!!",1

I enjoyed it so much I went back the next day and had the same thing lol. Oh, you have to try the lima beans! I HATE lima beans, but these aren't your average and hella good!!

Lots of vegetarian options but a little thin on vegan options.  That said, I thoroughly enjoyed my avocado toast with the watermelon radish.  We also tried the tot bowl and beignets.  I wish they had a grits option without cheese (I really wanted grits) but was happy with what I got.  I definitely want to try the Brussels sprouts when we come again.",1
4628,3,1549670400000,"I've been here wayyyy too many times to count.  Every time I stop by LV, it's the first stop right after getting off our plane.  On this trip, we came here 3 times out of the 4 days we were here.  It's insane how much we like this place!

For one, the food is delicioso!  The meat seems high quality.  I'd recommend sticking to the bulgogi and steaks.  I found their chicken, shrimp and anything meat wise to be ok. I like getting extra lettuce to wrap meat in, mushroom medley and broccoli fondue if you want a different kick in eating broccoli.  The other things that were ok was the macaroon (too old in that freezer so it was a bit stiff and way too sugary) and sauteed shishito peppers (we can make it better).

Overall, definitely a place we keep coming back to.  Service is a mix between ehh and decent depending on how tired or disgruntled the waitor/-ress is that day.  The price makes up for it and a really great deal for what you get!",2
4631,2,1550016000000,"I have to say that there is a great selection here.  The menu is what you would expect from a BBQ joint.  Once we looked over the menu we made our choices.  

The place is on the small side if you decide to dine in house.  But I kind of liked it.  It had a modern feel to it.  Bright red color on the wall making if feel warm in here.  It actually made me feel like I was in someone's kitchen while dining in.  You get to see your food prepared while you wait.

When our food was ready, I was ready.  These are big portions.  I had chosen the BBQ burger with a side of cheese fries.  My other half had chosen the brisket which came with two sides, which he opted for onion rings and a stuffing ball.  There was a bit of a hiccup when food did arrive, but not one that discouraged us from eating.  The sauces got mixed up for our meats.  I had wanted the mild sauce and he wanted the Korean sauce, but they were flipped.  We really didn't care, because we went forward with the meal.  I actually enjoyed the Korean sauce, it was a bit spicy and added a little something to the burger.

I thoroughly enjoyed the cheese fries.  They were fresh cut and the sauce, made in house.  You can tell the cheese sauce was homemade.  It had this thickness to it, not like that nacho cheese from a can.  The onion rings got some good compliments but the stuffing ball was a bit dry for his liking.  

The owner is quite nice to talk to while you are here too.  He seems to really enjoy what he does and what he has going here.  He was busy while we were here, but did not skip a beat and did everything with a smile on his face.  You can tell this is a popular spot, while we were dining they was a steady flow of customers coming in to pick up take out orders.",2

We walked in as a party of 5 on Thursday evening. No hostess in sight so we sat down at a table. After about 10 minutes of no service I went to the bar to let the bartender know we were there and ask if there would be a server for us. She assured me someone would be there soon. After the same person walked past our table about 5 times time wipe down other tables I finally got her attention. On top of looking like she was completely wasted on something, she was very slow. We realized that there was a ""normal"" server as she came up to the table a bit later.   Problem is she was working the entire room by herself. As others have mentioned, they run this place like a local bar where you have to know someone to feel welcome.

The steaks we ordered (filet for my wife, bone-in rib eye for me) both were perfectly cooked with a nice outside char.  The various sauces available also are a nice touch.  What helps this place stand out however are all the great appetizers--we had German potato balls and poached green beans and both were wonderful.  Desserts too, were excellent.

Most of the items went right past me, but it was still fun to go through. Some parts are interactive, which is something new besides just walking around. They have three different buildings you can visit with your admission. The one exhibit I did enjoy was 'Trace of Memory' Art where the artist has literally taken yarn and weaved complex patterns into the building itself. It was creepy and also peaceful in a way.

We ordered two different types of coffee.  If I take away the decor and ambience, and rate the Funky Munky on the coffee alone, it is a 3-star coffee for this price point.  The coffee was decent, but I have had richer, smoother coffee at similar prices for sure.  But taking away the decor is grossly unfair.  Heck, they name the cafe after the decor!  So put the points for the funky decor back in, the rating is 3.5 stars.

BTW, bubble teas are available here.  Kinda a refreshing east (bubble tea) + west (decent coffee) set up in GTA.  This place likely attracts a younger crowd, with its funky vibe and bubble teas.",2

I could eat a whole bag by myself and that's probably what's caused me to diet in the first place :) You can lesson the calorie blow by ordering the kids sized bag of chips. It seems to come with 15-20 chips which is a more waistline friendly portion if you have to have them. 

If you want something that satisfying and doesn't kill your diet, try a bowl with no rice or beans but get a scoop of chicken AND Steak. The extra meat really adds to the heartiness of the bowl and it feels like a treat. I also get mild salsa (pico), sour cream, cheese and the guacamole depending on how I'm feeling that day. If its a diet splurge day, I'm adding the sweet corn and tacking on a bag of chips!",2

I have thick, wavy Asian hair, and it was all choppy after the last place I went to screwed up big time. Hiroki, who is absolutely AMAZING, listened to what I wanted, made a few suggestions based on my hair type and condition, and now I have a sleek, airy hairstyle that requires absolutely no maintenance. All for the amazing price of 33 bucks.

The salon itself is small and rather minimalist, but it's clean and very well-lit. I wasn't used to the lack of conversation, though, and this is the first time the hairstylist hasn't chatted with me. Language barrier, perhaps? 

I will definitely be coming back!

The whole chicken was mediocre, shrimp risotto was a recipe from Paula Dean, and the short rib tasted like a rubber tire. The deserts were not bad. Prince point is outrageous, for a Joe Beef knock off. Go to Petit Bourgundy for the real thing and don't waste your time here.

They are homemade, they are fresh, they are tasty, they are.. everything that someone could ask for! Their sweets are what brought me in first, but I found out that everything that they offer on the menu is just as delightful. Small confession: I am slightly addicted to their Penne Alla Gigi. Nothing serious. 

Their menu includes salads, pasta, paninis and many more!

This is definitely a place that I would recommend trying out if you happen to be in the neighbourhood! And if you do decide to give it a try, make sure that you take a glimpse at their dessert counter (or, as I would call it, Heaven).",2

It's my local stop, so there are times when I visit quite frequently (uh oh, that sounds like I have a coffee problem...). Overall, service is good and it can be a great spot to people watch, if you can get a seat. Starbucks is Starbucks, but if you get a chance, try the Reserve coffees. They usually have different ones that range from regular to higher priced, but they can be pretty good. 

Pros:
- Close to where I live
- Good service, never wait very long to order or to receive my order
- Great tables & cozy chairs for hanging out/working on computer
- Clover Reserve coffee OH YEAH
- Nice patio seating
- Consistently friendly service (which is great considering how busy this place gets)

Cons:

Restaurant is gorgeous inside, he has put a ton of work into it. The food is top notch, best quality ingredients, which you can tell when you take the first bite. Service is always great, and it's where I purchase all of my Persian teas, sugar cubes and pastries.

And they've been extremely generous to me as a patient as well as caring, kind and compassionate. You can't beat their prices they've definitely come down since the beginning and are definitely competitive with other dispensaries in the area.

My wife and I stumbled upon this place by chance, but have now been back a few times on miscellaneous occasions. Our latest visit was to grab some dinner (since our fridge was bare and the thought of the grocery store seemed overwhelming) and catch the end of the Panthers season opener. What I have found you get with Old Pineville is a clean, upscale pub that serves a wide selection of good beer and a fresh and equally wide array of great pub grub. 

First off, I'm impressed how clean the place is. Plenty of TV's, seating, patio space, and they also use one of the TV's to display their current beer and draft selection. Speaking of, it is an impressive list. I think they had around 15 beers on tap when I was there. For food our last visit we ended up getting some wings and burger sliders (a.k.a. football food) and sitting at the bar. All of the food came out relatively quick and was really tasty. 

Another nice thing about this place is that it isn't absolutely swamped. I'm all about atmosphere for certain occasions, but I can't handle the crowds at places like All American for every Panther's game. If you want a spot where you can actually sit, watch and hear the game, and also have some side conversations with the people you came (or met at the bar), then this might be the place for you.

While I was there, I noticed that the restaurant was expanded with a new private dining/banquet room. I was so impressed with my experience that I decided to schedule our next company dinner there, as the new expansion can comfortably hold 80+ people and the price was extremely affordable.

I am VERY protective of my 7 year old. When Kaylee showed up she was super sweet and professional. We went out and actually had fun! Kaylee texted me to let me know how our little one was doing and sent a picture of the fort they made. We got back about a half hour earlier than planned but our baby was asleep and everything had been cleaned up. I do strongly recommend the company, however, I HIGHLY recommend Miss Kaylee.

I like coming here for the 2 for 1 cakes I. Sundays and I recommend the mocha with it. 

I also love doing breakfast here, we are veggies so he loves to have eggs over easy with hash-browns but I come for the Tuscan Benedict. It's got tomatoes and asparagus and the sauce isn't too heavy and 3 poached eggs!

They also do a beer and burger on Mondays, good deal and the veggie burger is good.

There is also a night that they have pasta and wine is $4 off! 

We like the service it's way better than the Yonge St location. Julian has been my server a few times, he's great!",2
4951,3,1551312000000,"We played 3 local golf courses while on our trip to Phoenix last week. 

While this place wasn't my favourite, it was definitely the nicest looking!! It's a beautiful course and we chose to play it so we could experience ""golf in the desert"". Visually, it was spectacular!

When we first arrived, we had a difficult time figuring out where to go. There aren't a lot of signs to guide you, so give yourself a little extra time. Fee's were the highest of all 3 courses we played but still reasonable (it was about $80).

Most holes aren't very long, but they offer a good challenge! Several holes are built into the side of one of the mountains with steep inclines (both up & down) which added some fun challenge. These holes also had amazing views of some of the valley!

Our favourite hole was on the back 9, where you had to cross a small bridge to an island to tee off. We even had a small turtle come join us on the tee box!

Overall, I think it was a great course to do once. Not totally sure I'd do it again unless they had a good deal going on (my fav course of the trip was half the price). But glad I got a chance to experience it :)",2
4952,3,1549756800000,"A great little neighbourhood pub if you're looking for super casual and cozy. The drinks are very reasonably priced, and there are always daily specials for food and drink.

I'm reading a lot of bad reviews about the Jersey Giant regarding the food and I'm a little surprised. I've eaten here 3 times now and I have no complaints!

On Monday, they have a wing special - 10 wings for $10 or 15 wings for $14. Comes with a serving of fries. Both were great, especially the fries here. We also tried the fish tacos which were decently tasty.

On another day we ordered the fish and chips when it was on special for $11.99 (with drink purchase). It was a really generous portion of fish with a perfectly light crisp beer batter. 

My hubby said he had the poutine before and loved it.

All in all, a solid place, but obviously for casual fare and it's not for some of the uptight patrons (which may have written some of the reviews). For example, if you know there's only one server working their butt off, cut them some slack! Big deal if you had to go to the bar to order? You never know if someone called in sick or something, and it's really not the server's fault if they're under-staffed either. Have a heart, and get up for some exercise every once in a while!

Maybe I enjoy it here more so because I am not coming in with the expectation of 5-star service (although I've always had good friendly service from all servers and bartenders here).",2

The slots are TIGHT-TIGHT-TIGHT. 

You pour thousands of dollars in these machines and you do not win.  

Total sham.  

It is great that other states are approving gambling .... maybe Vegas can wake-up and loosen the slots.  

Don't spend more than a couple of bucks...you can feed thousands into these machines...AND YOU ARE NOT WINNING.

Adequate, enough free weights to make it work. 
The fresh apples offered were nice. 



Five Stars: Room

Big comfortable quiet rooms.  Nothing fancy, just great size including the bathroom

Let me stop here and mention that when I go to a ""celebrity chef"" restaurant my expectations are a bit higher. It's not just about the food...it's about the overall experience. Fame and television programing has me pre-sold on the idea that this is going to be a very good experience. As a consumer I am not concerned that the beer delivery truck was delayed or that the kitchen didn't estimate what dishes would sell well enough that they were running out of portions by 1:00 in the afternoon. Now the food, I had the pork which was very good, cooked really well and was flavorful. My companion had a specialty burger and said it was very good as well.

I've been there twice.  
The first time the zone 2 girl was extremely earnest and told me how passionate she was about hair cutting.  And she was really good- full of energy, eagerness to learn.  And even though she burned my scalp several times while she was blow drying my hair, when the styling was done- my hair looked really good and she looked so eager to please that I could not be upset with her that despite my hair looking good, I probably had several patches of scalp toasted enough to be red the next day.
The second time I went back, I got another zone 2 girl.  Very nice, good personality but somehow completely lacking in energy.  This sister's scalp massage was so lacking in oof that I felt like flies were in my hair and I wanted to swat her fingers away.  
I should have known my haircut would be bad and left right away.  She ended up taking so long with my haircut that I finally had to ask her to see the clock to see what time it was- it took her nearly 2 hours to give me a cut and style that I, one who is incompetent with styling, could have done myself.  I was so disappointed.  Luckily, the instructor came and saved the day and in matters of five minutes, she had me styled looking like a million bucks and I walked away somewhat happy.
Would I come back again?  Probably but now that I am a veteran of this place, I will ask for a zone 4 or higher girl (they go from zone 1 to zone 6) so maybe next time I will be lucky enough to walk out with scalp unburned, and a cut and style that won't take up my whole day.",2

We got the charcuterie board to start, and then the 32 ounce dry-aged steak (medium rare). The charcuterie board was very nicely laid out, but the taste was underwhelming. The bread that came with it did not really complement the meats. The steak was ordered medium-rare, but came out more rare.

The Portuguese tiramisou is worth a taste as well.

We had a tee time and waited 45 minutes to begin because of the league pissing around on the tee off and not playing. They should say something to those men who have no courtesy of others..,2
5161,2,1550361600000,"Maybe they should stick to what they do best. Iphone repairs. My HTC phone gorilla glass were shattered and the LCD digitizer was also broken. I went in and got a quote for $109 - no discount. You can't even use the yelp check-in coupon. So I thought, ok fine. If that gets my phone fixed, why not? I came in at 11am, paid in full and left my phone there. Their staff said my phone will be ready by 5pm. I went there at 5pm, guess what, the staff showed me that they ordered the wrong colored parts, so I have to wait another 45 mins. After 45 mins, they brought me back my phone, heavily glued, with the LCD digitizer and glass screen not properly affixed to the phone. There are gaps and glue residue everywhere. OK. sure. and guess what? My phone can't read my sim card. Luckily I checked it before leaving the premise. I brought it back, letting them know that my phone won't read my simcard. Their manager, or the person in charge, supervisor whatever, gave me a look and just said ok we will check it again. After waiting for 15 mins, I had to ask them about the status of my phone, he just simply said, oh we have to take it apart again. That will be another 45 to 30 mins. OK sure. I went back home and came back after 30 mins, and my phone still isn't ready. After a while, finally I got my phone back. Still with the glue residue, still with gaps between the back cover and the glass & LCD digitizer, but at least this time its reading my sim. I tested my phone, to ensure that its working, sure it does. It looks ugly but now it works, but when I make normal phone call, my speaker isn't as loud as it used to be. Sure there's 30 days warranty, but I after what they did to my phone? I won't be coming back. Maybe they should've just told me that they aren't able to repair HTC phones, at least I wouldn't be wasting my time and money. And to the person in charge, lose that attitude will you? We're paying customers.",3

5165,1,1551139200000,"If you're a Tempe/Mesa native or an ASU student or alum, then you probably know Haji-Baba. I, however, am neither and only recently discovered this awesome place by way of a recommendation on Twitter.

Since then, I've been there five times and have tried nearly everything on the menu. The food is delicious! Seriously, there hasn't been one thing I've tried that I haven't enjoyed.

On my first trip, I ordered the combination. I highly recommend doing this if you've never eaten here before. This plate gives you a great sampling of what their menu has to offer and a generous portion at that. It's easily enough for two people and, at only around $12, a great deal too.

On my most recent visit, I had the Gyro plate; again amazing! A very generous portion served with a delicious salad, a side of rice, and I topped the meal off with an Arabic coffee.

Haji-Baba is not really a secret and the place will get very busy at lunch time. If you want to eat there, go for an early or late lunch, otherwise you'll have to wait for a table; it's worth it!

They have a large menu and great prices, and if you don't have time to stay and eat, you can order to-go from the counter.

The staff do a good job, but their food is so good, I'd still eat there if a server punched me in the face every time I walked in the door.

If you haven't tried it, you need to go there. If you have, then you know just how great Haji-Baba is.",2

5177,1,1551052800000,"The reviews do not lie. I bought some slim fit dress shirts, but even still they were too wide so when I tucked them in I got that unsightly look where there is too much material sticking out and looking like a parachute around my waist. 

I went on Yelp and looked at a few tailors with good reviews. I saw all of the 5 star reviews for Habib's and with this I decided to drive a few miles further and give it a shot. I walked into the store and he had me put on all 3 shirts and fitted me right there. He told me to come back in exactly a week. I was expecting them to be done sooner but I didn't need them ASAP so I was fine with a week (more on this later). A week passes, I go into his store to get the shirts. He sees me and says ""3 shirts right??"". I was very surprised. I had only been in his store once before, a week ago and only for about 5 minutes. I'm sure he gets a lot of business but even with that he remembered exactly what I dropped off.

Took the shirts home, tried them on, tucked them in, and now they look extremely clean and nice fitting. No excess material around the waist. Guys, if you ever wondered how the male models in the magazines get their shirts to look so nice and smooth tucked in, the answer is having them tailored. This was my first time ever tailoring my shirts and I will continue to do it now after seeing the before and after.

A few reviewers here have said that you can pretty much name a day/time when you want or need to pick up your items and Habib will get it done. This is true. When I was in the store waiting to pick up my shirts, some guy walked in and said he needed his belt fixed. It was a Saturday morning. Habib said I can have it done for you by Monday. The guy said I need it sooner, what about tomorrow? Habib said I am not open tomorrow. And the guy was like well then I need it today. And Habib said ""ok, come back at 3:30 and I'll have it done."" So yes, he can and does work with you.

- The cost to tailor (slim down the sides of the shirt and the sleeves) of my three dress shirts came out to $45. That is $15 per shirt. I thought this was rather expensive, but I admit I know nothing about the garment industry. So after I got home I looked online and it seems the regular price to tailor a shirt is anywhere from $15-$20 per shirt. So Habib's is right on the mark with the price.",2

5190,1,1549843200000,"I met my buddy there for our once-a-year-get-amazing-food-dinner we like to do. When I flew out I saw a write up on the place in SkyMall magazine. Figured I'd need to try it. 

The restaurant is gorgeous with huge vaulted ceilings, lots of dark wood and stone and a great open bar. It was very dim and there was a mix of couples, friends, and businessmen throughout. Not a particular vibe since this was in the Cosmo in Vegas. 

Service was top-notch. Nothing to remark on there. The food was outstanding save for one dish. Neither I nor my friend particularly liked the macaroni and cheese. Nothing was 'wrong' with it, we simply didn't care for the flavor. So in exceptional service and expected standards, they took back the item and did not charge us for the meal. 

This is on the steeper end of the price range and I can certainly eat better steak here in Montana but the wine was well-priced and there was overall, nothing to complain about. I definitely enjoyed my experience.

Chicken tikka masala, chicken masala, tapioca, roasted okra, sweet onion chn, meatballs and so much more.

5265,1,1549843200000,"Am I the only one without a blown mind while eating at Other Mama? I suppose so. Perhaps I was expecting a lot from Other Mama due to the wonderful reviews, the high star ratings, and a head chef that trained under Morimoto. So yeah, I was expecting some out of this world, mind blowing, and unforgettable dishes ... but truth be told, I was quite disappointed. 

My friend and I went in one night for dinner and sat at the bar. We chatted with David English a little about the restaurant and the menu. I started with the Mildred, which composed of bicardi, lime, and a strawberry-mint soda while my friend went with the Beryl, which was a mix of apricot buffalo trace, blood orange bitters, and yuzu tincture. Both drinks were priced at $9. Both were pretty good aside from the Beryl being a little bit too strong due to the whiskey but no problem! English has got it! He added more sugar to it to help dilute it and it helped! 

We started off with half a dozen of oysters. They had three types of oysters on special that night: Fanny Bay, Bluepoint, and one other one that I can't seem to remember the name of. We chose to have two of each. And I LOVED them. I simply LOVE oysters and they were indeed VERY FRESH. On top of the freshness, the price point was to die for! Fanny Bays were $1.50 each. Bluepoints were $1.00 each. And the third one, the one with the most brine was $2.00 each. Where else can you get amazingly fresh oysters for this price in Las Vegas? Uh, no where. The taste of the Bluepoints were so fresh and crisp. The Fanny Bays were also a favorite with their slightly stronger flavor.  They pretty much have every type of condiment you would want with oysters ranging from their special house sauces to your traditional Tabasco bottle.  

As for some main entrees, we ordered chirashi, spicy yuzu chicken wings, and pork belly kim chi fried rice. 

Chirashi: I love sushi. And I love sushi rice. Our chirashi bowl came with bigeye ahi tuna, salmon, octopus, amberjack, shrimp ceviche, ikura, a type of white fish that I forgot the name to, and avocado. This dish made me realize that I really don't like amberjack. It turns chalky in your mouth as you chew on it and ... I kind of don't like that. The tuna had a strange texture, bouncy almost. The salmon, shrimp ceviche, white fish, and octopus were all really good. The ikura, however, was a bit disappointing. Half of the ikura looked popped to me. 

Now, as for the sushi rice...it tasted like regular rice. Though, my personal preference, I like my sushi rice to have hints of vinegar because it helps balance flavors of raw fish. It was actually difficult for us to finish this. In the end of it all, the chirashi bowl was possibly the most disappointing dish we've had that night. We did talk to the chef about it and he stated that he liked his sushi rice to be on the more mild side. Therefore, he puts in less vinegar than the traditional recipe, which we understand. However, it is just not our cup of tea. 

Spicy Yuzu Chicken Wings: The wings are done really well. The crispness of the wings were really light, which is a plus. However, the dish itself didn't really do much for me. Nothing really jumped out at me. The sauce that they used on top of it ... just seemed like a regular gochujang recipe. 

Pork Belly Kimchi Fried Rice: It's comforting to know that the kimchi is made in house. I like how it was served in a hot/clay pot, which keeps the dish warm. It had huge chunks of pork belly with a nice sunny side egg right on top of the rice. The pork belly chunks were HUGE and you get a lot of it. However, I do believe if they cooked the pork belly along with the fried rice as a whole, the flavor would be remarkable. The kimchi tasted like Chinese preserved vegetables and the rest were quite mild in flavor. Once again, I can't say I enjoyed the dish due to how mild the flavors were. It just doesn't hit home. 

We ended the night with the Japanese style cheesecake. Japanese cheesecake is airy, fluffy and light in flavor. It's typically very soft in texture. Other Mama's version threw us for a loop. The texture, the look, and the feel of my fork getting a piece of cheesecake all screamed NY style cheesecake. It was dense. However, it was LIGHT in flavor, but quite far from the airy and fluffiness that I desire. 

Overall, Other Mama is fantastic for their oysters. Great price for great quality. But a lot of the other dishes were a miss for my taste buds. I'm sure the quality and the dishes are great .. just not for me. When I think Asian Fusion, I think traditional flavors with a twist. From the dishes that we have tried that night, the traditional tastes were absent, and therefore, the twists did not do much for us. But hey, it could be because my taste buds are weird. Who am I to say?",2
5265,3,1550448000000,"OK, it's really in my opinion 3 1/2 stars because it is after all a pizza place but the Caprese Salad made with Burrata cheese is so tasty I bumped it up to 4. The past few times I have had pizza there I have been disappointed, limp crust, bland sauce, salty toppings BUT the Caprese is my new favorite dish in PHX. The Burrata is creamy and lucious, the balsamic reduction is tangy and sweet, the flash roasted cherry tomatoes are juicy and full of flavor.

The hostess needs to inform people accurate information. We had a short 10min wait upon arrival. So to the management at this location, you may need to retrain your host staff.",2
5352,3,1551139200000,"Not sure that I'm one to conform to all the hype on this place. I checked it out because it's close to my work and had a bunch of good reviews, but I won't be adding to those. 

Right from the get go I was a little let down. There was a line that was fairly long, not outrageous but fairly long. It took a full 25 minutes just to get to the front of the line. Perhaps my bitterness carried over to the food, but I was not very impressed at all. I had a chili cheese dog that barely even rivals a dog from QT. The fries were very bland, pretty much no flavor, and I still spent almost 9 bucks.",2

5359,1,1550534400000,"For a five-star hotel, the Trump was definately lacking in credability.

[Pros:]
- Beautiful Hotel: The lobby, pool, rooms were all gorgeous.
- TV in the bathroom? For sure!
- Studio Suites have a very smart layout: Simplistic to have 4+ people in a room and get ready without inconveniencing one other.
- Room Service: Saturday morning breakfast was quite tasty!

[Cons:]
- Bloody mary was like an over peppered watered down cocktail. Absolutely disgusting.
- Room service took over an hour to prepare, I almost forgot we ordered it.
- House keeping failed! We asked them to clean up, they barely even fixed the bed.
- My cousin asked for blankets over 3 times and they ultimately failed to provide him with them.
- My bed had ripped sheets in it. RIPPED SHEETS in a five star hotel? You must be joking...

Verdict: I had fun, but there were way too many things that had to be fixed about this hotel experience. I would consider staying here again only if I were guaranteed with a five-star experience...",2
5360,2,1550534400000,"We had fun but I thought the event would be bigger and better than other Chinese New Year's celebrations around the city. Enjoyed the different booths, food and freebies, but it would have been nice to listen to Asian music (before and after the stage entertainment) instead of pop songs. Also, the entertainment was NOTHING like the celebrations/parades at The Venetian and Bellagio. I guess I set my expectations too high. I kinda thought that Chinatown's celebration and festival would be better than everyone elses. So I was disappointed with the stage show, dragon dance, lion dance, etc. But it was fun, just $3 per person, but the other celebrations we went to throughout the city were free.",2

They are willing to do just about anything creative that you or they can think up of to make your wedding day or event just that much more special.

5397,3,1549756800000,"I've got to give this place 5 stars purely because they are so fantastic working with GiGi's Playhouse.  This is very much a family style diner, kitchen to the back and loads of tables and booths.  You could easily fit a large party in here and have room to talk.  It's also a very quiet atmosphere, and with LED lights above each booth you can actually see the menu and your companions.

The menu is simple home-cooking American foods: meatloaf, sandwiches, chicken, and homemade pies.  The dinnerware reminds me of my grandmother and just makes me feel warm and fuzzy.  We had already been out for lunch, so we did desert and clearly the cute silver platter serving bowl was a hit with this girl.  The pie crust was flaky and buttery and the service was friendly and fast.  

Sometimes the simplicity of comfort is just good.",2

Not to say it was fast, but the food had a salty taste.  I like to keep it to a pinch, but I think they used the whole bag here.  I had some hot and sour soup and boy it was sour alright!  I also ordered the House Special CK - and that's when the saltiness hit me like a ton of bricks.  Wowza! 

The place overall was not appealing to the eye.  I wasn't sure if I'd get sick after eating here, but luckily my immune system is strong enough not to get salt poisoning haha! - Good Luck and Enjoy!",1

I am not one that is particularly critical of Mexican food especially tacos but I have to say this was probably the worst thing I have had in the casino since I've been here.

I wouldn't have if she wasn't wearing gloves. and previously to me even ordering the food the Caucasian giggling girl committed 3 acts of cross contamination and the African American girl (the one who gave me the attitude)  called her out for it and the giggling girl just ignored her and rolled her eyes.",2

Why did I only give them 4 stars? They only gave me $20k for a car I could have traded or sold for $24k-$25k. They sold it the next day.

5466,2,1550016000000,"I've been here when it was known as the Westgate, so I figured it'd be pretty nice.  Instead, we ran into a lot of annoyances and inconveniences while staying here.

I will give them the benefit of the doubt that they only made the transfer over a few months ago and are still working out the clinks in their systems, but damn.... it's at my expense.

I'll give that the price i paid for our one bedroom suite was a pretty nice deal and the people in my party enjoyed it as we all had plenty of space to crash on the bed or floor.  The restroom had glass doors allowing us to get really close and comfortable with each other. The hot tub/jacuzzi.... omg  wish it was bigger to fit more people, but i think 5 of us had a good time in there.  The sound speakers were a nice fit, although we had to unplug it to retrofit it to our ipod.  Never used the projector, but it's nice if needed.  Why would we want to block the amazing view that we had?

Well here's the bad stuff that i hope no one else has to experience.  at 7am in the Saturday morning, we got a morning phone call from the front desk to check our front door, because it was reported that it was left open and was a safety issue.  I'm appreciative that they did that, but I heard them before the phone call, so i checked the door to talk to the security lady because i thought we were going to finally get the towels we requested the night before.  Nope.... (on a side note, you need to turn off the do not disturb sign, or your doorbell won't ring.)  When we called back the front desk to complain and get our towels, they claimed to not have a log of the incident... Rude...

Pooltime, I'm not a big pool person, but we were trying to get into Marquee day club, but after waiting and getting no results, we opted for the FREE hotel pool. So we had a nice time, although you can't bring your own drinks in... sadness.... anyways some people in our group were apparently goofing off and got more than one warning, so i got kicked out for the day.  Lesson, don't f**k around the pool, lifeguards gotta keep drunk asses safe. But security was reasonable and said we could come back tomorrow, just get out today. I don't blame them.

Aside from that, check-in/check-out was seamless less than 5 minutes, no paper.  Good: really quick and efficient.... Bad: don't know how to work in a tip to get a tip in so short a time.",1

5468,1,1549497600000,"I came to South Point early Saturday morning. I had reserved two rooms through Priceline. When I checked in the lady at front desk was only able to find my reservation for one room. I showed her my confirmation for the two room but she insisted that Priceline only submitted the reservation for one room.  

Next she had Leham Reed step in to help her. Leham was not very helpful instead had me step aside to call Priceline about my reservation. Keep in mind it is now one in the morning. I was on hold with Priceline for 45 minutes because your staff failed to assist me. They made me call Priceline to fax over the confirmation even though I showed them my email confirmation. While on hold, I even asked him if I can just pay for another room but he was deterring me telling me it's too expensive. He said it would only be for one night and I would need to check out by 10:00AM and would need to call reservations in the morning to book the room again for Saturday night! However, there was a group that came after me that was able to book two nights on the spot. 

The hotel will not provide the same level of service to guests that book through Priceline versus guest who book directly with them I should not have to be on the phone at 1:00AM when the staff should simply be more helpful. I come to Las Vegas at least seven times a year. I have stayed at numerous hotels on the strip. Needless to say this will be my very last time staying here. 

I even sent an email to the hotel and this was their response:

We are very sorry to hear your very first stay with us was not an enjoyable experience.  We want you to know that when any reservation is booked with a third party company we are not allowed to alter or add anything to an existing reservation.  If a guest books with a third party and pays them we cannot create a reservation in our hotel system since the transaction was between the guest and that company.  We ask our guests to contact the company they booked with and that company will then change or create a missing reservation and send it to us.  We have discussed this situation our front desk staff and want you to know that this is defiantly not the type of guest service we train our staff for.  It really is our pleasure to have you stay with us and we hope you will reconsider a future visit.

As a straight girl, I wouldn't ever expect to find a boy at Cherry that was actually interested (at some gay bars, I can expect this).  

My most recent visit was this past Friday night.  Our bartender (whose name I can't clearly remember) was super friendly and served us up complimentary guacamole.  They have reasonable prices and Blue Moon on draft.  

If I were a gay man, this might be my favorite bar.  But, when I need a little fruit fly action, Cherry Bar is high on the list.",2

Beer was cold and cheap. Jello-o shots were jello-y.  They had a live piano player that was more than welcoming to my friends that took over for some ad-lib karaoke. 

Overall, great bar to stop into for a few near the end of a long night. Bonus: they have a foosball table.",3
5484,3,1550793600000,"There have been some changes at the DMV and I'm impressed. No more waiting in a long line yay! This new ""Dash Pass"" system worked well. With the Dash Pass you can text, call or go online and put yourself in the line without having to even go down to the DMV until it's your turn. They will text you with how many people are ahead of you and your estimated wait time and then they send you a command list so you can text back whenever you want to find out things like how long your current wait time is or to let them know if you need more time or even if you want to be taken out of the line. They text you with fair enough warning about when your turn is so you know when to arrive at the DMV and they let you know around that time what window you will need to go to. This is seriously awesome! I never would have thought I'd give the DMV 5 stars, but this new system really worked great for me twice now and the employees were even really friendly. I needed to renew my license so I had to go inside. Usually I avoid going inside since they have the DMV kiosks around town at a variety of places and it's so convenient to stop and register your car at the kiosk and you can do it at any hour. Sometimes though you just can't avoid having to go inside and now it's not that bad having to do so. The snack bar seems to get bigger and bigger and the line of people at it cracks me up, but hey why not grab a hot dog, nachos or cotton candy while at the DMV? When it came time to pay for my license renewal and the lady told me it would cost $41.25 I was shocked. I asked why so much now and she said that I would be getting a license good for 8 years. Say what?!?! Apparently those born even numbered years get the 8 year license and those in odd numbered years that renew will continue to receive the 4 year license until 2017 and then get the 8 year license after that. I kind of like the idea of not having to go back for 8 years a lot. I'm kind of surprised though since people do age differently among other things. I didn't have an issue with finding a parking spot like I have many times before and that was nice. I'm guessing the parking lot wasn't so bad because people are maybe using Dash Pass. I am happy to say that I had a quick and painless experience at the DMV.",2
5488,1,1549929600000,This is our third time coming here and the food came out fast and the owner came out and ask us how the food was and it was really really good we are so full right now but will becoming back oh and the staff are very friendly and they are beginning to know us,2
5501,1,1548979200000,"My boyfriend was looking for a place for this parents to eat at and we were originally going to this other Chinese restaurant but took a wrong turn and ended up in this plaza so we just decided to eat here instead.

It was about 5pm - pretty early for dinner for Asian people at least - cause besides us, there was only one other diner in the place. It was so empty they even decided to turn off some of the lights in the restaurant. I didn't really expect that many people honestly - this is Arizona, and it is 5 PM.  

We sat down and ordered three dishes:
 
Chestnut and Chicken Pot - super flavorful dish! - chicken was tender and went very well with the chestnuts 

Crispy Noodles with Seafood Gravy - I really would have liked it more if they didn't drench it with the gravy because I do like the crispy part of the noodles but since they poured a lot of sauce onto it - all the noodles got soaked. 

Chinese Veggie (Choi Sum with garlic) - tender and garlicky. 

The food was surprisingly very tasty. I expected not very good Chinese food here but to my amazement, the food was pretty decent - however it did cost way more than Chinese restaurant in say like San Gabriel or Monterey Park area (for those of you from LA would know what I'm talking about) here it's like about double the price - but i think it's because they don't get half as busy as in other places that are populated with Asian people. 

The waiters and waitresses looked pretty bored most of the time - but things started to pick up around 6ish when we were about to leave. Reviews say that this place is good for dim sum - I wish I could try it but since my bf graduated today I don't think I'll be coming back to Arizona any time soon. 

Overall however I think this is a pretty good place for dinner - the prices a little higher but like I said there aren't too many other Chinese restaurants like this around.",2

5530,3,1549584000000,"What I like best about Eliot's Bookshop is its Science-Fiction section.  I could peruse this section alone for hours on end looking for much of the ""Classic"" and now often hard to find volumes of yesteryear.

As any Sci-Fi fan knows, many authors write a ""series"" of books to tell their tale, and often certain volumes can be hard to find - especially those that were written long, long ago, during my formidable teenage years - ha ha!    

As a kid - back in the day - I bought many novels using money from my part-time job flipping burgers.  However, the minimum wage I made as a teenager usually meant that I could only afford the first volume or two, forcing me to get many of my novels from my local school or public library to finish reading a series - such as Fred Saberhagen's ""Beserker Series"" of novels.  

This, of course, could be frustrating if you wanted to own a completed series that you really enjoyed, or if the author added to the series later on in their career.  

Of course - as an adult - I can now afford to buy many of those missing books.  Finding them, though, can often be a challenge.  At Eliot's, I am often able to find many books that were formerly missing from my collection to FINALLY complete a tale.

The only reason I don't give Eliot's a five star rating is due to the fact that they don't seem to offer much in the way of used ""Hardcover"" novels (which I would pay a premium for) in their Sci-Fi area.  Instead, it is predominantly ""Paperback"" in this particular section.  Otherwise, Eliot's Bookshop is a great store and certainly a trustworthy long-time staple to the Yonge Street circuit.",1
5531,2,1550707200000,"Came here for happy hour while waiting for our room to be cleaned/ready at the Hard Rock! 
We got there at around 3:30 on Friday. Wasn't too busy. Found a spot at the end of the bar. 
Boyfriend and I both got margaritas. They were good, pretty strong. To eat, he got the ahi tuna tostadas and I got the sopes. I know happy hour plates are supposed to be small, but geez. 
His tostadas were literally 3 chips with a couple pieces of tuna on top. Super small! 
My sopes were GOOD. Like soo good. But again, so so tiny. I could probably fit two in the palm of my hand, and the plate only comes with 3 -.- 
Anyways, the food was good. Just wish there was a littttle more. Luckily they give you chips and salsa, which were bangin. Probably the best chips and salsa I've ever had. I'm always weary to try salsas because I'm a huge baby with anything spicy but this was delicious and smoky and perfect. 
Very well done, Pink Taco.",2

5552,3,1550448000000,"There are few reviews on DMV services that actually rate above average- unfortunately this is no exception. 

There is always a crowd here. Not just any crowd, but seemingly everyone on the north end of Mecklenburg county in need of DMV services. Very high-volume. You need to get here at 7am in order to wait outside for an hour (opens at 8am), get in, get seated, wait another hour for what seems like no reason at all, talk to someone, and take care of your issues.

Is the crowd the DMV's fault? Absolutely not. Is the fact that they still operate out of a trailer with no more than 1,200 sq ft in use their fault? Yeah, I'd say so. I've been in town for close to 7 years now and have not seen one facility improvement made to alleviate the wait time or spacial constraint whatsoever. Why the local DMV with possibly the highest amount of customers doesn't have a legitimate building is beyond me. Oh and as a side note, as the line sometimes (I use this term loosely) wraps outside the building, better hope it's not raining!

Professionalism. I wouldn't say there is a complete lack, but I've had an instance where I've called ahead to verify information, arrived, wasted hours of my time, and ultimately found out I was missing documents that were not made aware to me on the phone. To make matters worse, and as many DMV's are horrible about this, the representative didn't seem to mind in the least that I was in the predicament, and told me I would have to wait in line all over again.

Overall, I highly recommend either arriving at 7am with all your research done via internet ahead of time (www.ncdot.gov/dmv), or make the drive to another semi-local agency, such as in Iredell county. Take my word for it, it will be worth your time.",2

This clinic has great hours and every time I've gone it's been a pleasant experience. From the reception staff to the Physicians assistants to the X-ray techs, everyone has always been really nice and seemed to genuinely care. I went in a few days ago because I had been consistently sick for a month. My PCP had given me 3 different antibiotics and nothing helped. I came in and there were about 6 people ahead of me however I probably only waited about 30 minutes to be seen (not bad for a walk in). They were able to swab my throat to test for strep right there and had results within 5 minutes. I saw a physician assistant named Emilie and she was awesome! She listened to what I had been through so far with treatments and almost immediately called that I had bronchitis. She had X-rays done just to be sure and she was right. She sent my prescriptions to the pharmacy, I took my first dose that night and for the first time in A MONTH I woke up feeling well the next day. I've always had quick visits. This last visit was the longest at an hour and a half for the wait, throat swab, seeing the PA, getting X-rays taken developed and looked at, and being diagnosed. I think that's pretty good considering that they were kind of busy for a Tuesday night. As for the cost of everything, they are covered under my insurance so I just had a copay that covered everything, sorry I can't be of help there.

This is a review of the Beachwood city branch, a small yet nicely remodeled facility. There are great nonfiction and children's sections; however, the fiction selection is a bit lacking. The Saul Eisen Reading Garden offers a tranquil, secluded reading space. For research projects, one might be better served at the Mayfield and South Euclid city branches (the latter is set in an exquisite old local castle-esque building).

All of the branches -- east and west -- afford the opportunity to find a quiet place to get lost in a great piece of literature and/or media.

5672,1,1549324800000,"Pros: 
No problems with the food.

Cons:
The service. I was with my elderly grandparents, who do not speak fluent English. The waitress was extremely rude from beginning to end and made our first experience uncomfortable. Instead of explaining in a patient/kind manner, she became frustrated quickly when my grandfather didn't understand the menu right away. She jabbed her fingers at the menu and rolled her eyes and raised her voice at him. My grandfather is not an obnoxious person, nor is he one to act rudely to anyone. We all watched her in disbelief because we couldn't believe what we were seeing/hearing. I have personal experience working as a waitress myself in busy restaurants and I have NEVER, EVER acted in such a rude, horrid manner to even the most ridiculously obnoxious customers. We left with a bad taste in our mouths JUST BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE, which is a shame. Because the food was amazing. Dear management, thank you for the food, but please instruct your employees in basic manners. I'm very hesitant to recommend this place to friends and family.

Bad:  Wait time was horrible as there were many open tables and still waited for over 30 minutes.  I think they were a bit understaffed.   Biscuits were barely room temperature if that.

The bread boy/ relish tray boy also rocks since it meant I could fill my starving stomach- that bread tho- AMAZING. It's crust of garlicky, Parmesany goodness was off the chain! They could probably do away with the carrots and celery, but the olives were good. And although the cottage cheese is random and a little odd, the chives that they added gave it a decent, unexpected flavor. We ordered the flatbread appetizer and the flavor wasn't bad but half of it was burned- not just a little over cooked, it was literally charred black. My fiancé ordered the Greek pasta dish and added chicken- good thing he did because he only got about 5 bow tie noodles. I wonder what the dish would have looked like if he didn't add the chicken... I got the beef Wellington- it was alright, but it kind of reminded me of hotel room service- good, but most definitely not worth the $30 I paid for it. Potatoes were dry too so I just didn't eat them. For the quality of food we received, this restaurant was wayyyyy overpriced. I don't mind paying the money for an excellent meal, but this just wasn't it. Also, our waitress wasn't all that great. It's like she was too scripted, but forgot some of her lines- I told her I needed some more time with the wine menu and when she came back, never asked me if I wanted a glass and ran away before I could ask her for one. She also brought our check before asking us if we wanted dessert- two things that we wanted and could have increased our bill and subsequently increased her tip.

Although, the ambiance is not as transcendent to Golden Buddha, the food was in my opinion..better. 

Very authentic, and lots of  carts to choose from. The best pork buns, sticky rice wrapped in traditional banana leaves, crispy shrimp egg rolls, congee with thousand years egg...I didn't care for the egg too much as it was very over powering, however if you like that sort of egg richness then give it a try. Even though I didn't care for that part of the soup, I still finished my bowl! The tarrot root cake was my favorite part. Try the shu mai with the vinegar sauce...and oh my goodness the ROASTED PORK WAS TO DIE FOR!! 
They even let you take home the leftovers. 

Our table was not ready when we got to it, a couple of spoons were not cleaned well and we never got any water with our meal. The service is probably my only complaint.

-Delicious southern style food. We've been here a few times now and every time the food has been solid. I highly recommend the Darnell - 2 or 3 fried catfish filets with a waffle. Served with syrup. I was hesitant at first because ""fish and waffles"" just doesn't have the same ring as ""chicken and waffles"" but let me tell you...it's just as delicious. 
-Sides for days. There are soooo many sides to choose from. You could honestly make a whole meal from just sides. But if you are going to get a side, you should get the Mac and cheese. So cheesy and delicious. 
-Friendly service. The first time we went there, we stayed longer just because we were having such a great conversation with the manager. Very hospitable!

Cons:
-Scattered service (but disclaimer, we went on Mother's Day). I don't really think this is standard for their service, but it did feel like our service was a little all over the place/not sure who our actual waiter was. Again, it was the brunchiest holiday of the year so don't think this is typical!

This small restaurant is cozy and welcoming, reminiscent  of a rustic Italian pub.  The service was attentive and friendly, casual and accessible. 

Our appetizers were promptly served. The calamari was nicely breaded but had little seasoning; white wine mussels were excellent. Their seasoned olives are made in house. 

However, all but one of the main courses were bland - and I tried them all :) . Only the lobster ravioli was memorable. Fettucine with a vodka rose sauce was muted. The chef's special, a pasta with anchovy and prosciutto, lacking in character. The wood fired pizza was fresh with nicely seasoned toppings, however soggy due to the thin crust.  

For desert, we enjoyed a local lemon ice.  While the waitress highly recommended the house tiramisu, we found that it too lacked character.

They have a bar in which you can buy fancy light flashing souvenir cups which is rather annoying while trying to watch the show and see blue sparkling everywhere. Damn dorks! Turn the switch off.. it is on the BOTTOM of the cup. How rude! Expensive though! $10 bucks for a small 10oz soda, you are paying for the fancy cup. Ridiculous but this is Vegas! I would not be surprised if they make more money from the bar than they do on the actual show. Two drinks is the cost of a show ticket, seriously!

This show is worth the money, fairly reasonable. You can get discounts on multiple shows through the V Theatre box office, sometimes $20.00 off voucher with a purchase of another show from any of the David Saxe/ V Theatre shows at Planet Hollywood. For these shows paying full price is not neccessary and should be criminal! Look at your show ticket stubs for a discount if you have time for another ""V"" or ""Saxe"" theatre show at Planet Hollywood. 

A must see for all music lovers and of course Beatlemania folks!

Enjoy!",2

We have a 10 year old as well and thus have had several different experiences with different schools and this is one of the best we have had - the educational structure and teacher quality is equivalent to what we experienced at bright horizons (but 1/2 the cost).

5869,2,1551225600000,"I come to Akaihana a lot. Like far more than I probably should given it's almost the opposite end of town for me. There a couple reasons I come here but the key ones are fair prices and good sushi. The others are it's a nice central meeting spot for my buddies and I and also right by my girlfriends work.

When I come here 9 out of 10 times I am ordering the Sushi Special ($13) which is a cali roll, 5 pieces of nigiri, a spicy salmon hand roll, miso soup and their special salad. The salad (on the menu as dynamite salad) is one of my favorite things it's cucumber noodles with chunks of various fish in a light but spicy marinade. The salad size with the sushi special is a pretty decent size but the half size on the menu is pretty much a meal for 1 person for $7. It does tend to be a bit of a crap shoot on the quantity of the fish in it though. The sushi special as a whole though is a solid meal even for somebody like me who can put down a lot of sushi.

Happy hour prices are fantastic here and run almost all day on the weekdays. I think cali rolls run about $3.50 on happy hour and spicy tuna isn't much more.

Other things I have liked are the shrimp boats which are pretty unique and they have plenty of other in house special rolls.

There are two reasons why this place isn't a five star, the first and primary being service. The service here can be really hit or miss, sometimes is great and things come out quick and you get attended to quickly. Other times you may wait 10 minutes for a drink refill or 30 minutes+ for sushi. I've had cases where we have been in and out in about 30-45 minutes and other times where it took 30 minutes before we got the first roll. I've also had items get forgotten or watched them sit ready at the counter for 10 minutes before having to ask the status. This is really amplified when the restaurant is busy. However I will say the servers are very nice and never rude or off putting, they just aren't always on the ball.

The second issue is minor but worth noting in that the rolls can sometimes be rolled too loose where they come apart too easy. Sometimes I think this is an issue with the rice they are using and sometimes the chef. I don't have much of an issue working around this but it's hard for chopstick newbies or those who aren't fully comfortable with chopsticks.

Overall the value, fish quality and options for tasty bites here far outweigh the service issues.",2

Just very unorganized and under staffed.  The front desk employees also do the blood draws.

Every time, I come here, I always picture where the original living room was and dining room. They have little lights everywhere and it is very dim. They also light not a candle but an oil lamp. Which is even cuter. 

We started off with a stuffed artichoke, which is my favorite thing to eat here. It is absolutely delicious! They always serve fresh baked bread. The salad is also good. I got one of the specials. Which was shrimp ravioli with shrimp. When it arrived, it was very delicious. I put extra cheese on it. The ravioli itself was very flavorful and had a lot of shrimp in it.

I also added the speculoos syrup which is, trust me, only the best thing ever!! You know those Biscotti cookies that are given out on United? This is a syrup made out of those and is just about the best addition to those waffles. Definitely recommend speculoos on anything you order here. The staff is polite.

Let's talk Brazilian, shall we? Yes, they suck. They are embarrassing, painful, etc. I thought all of those things until someone referred me to Jackie at A Wild Hair. She is a hair removal goddess sent from above. 

The waxing room has a peaceful massage room vibe to it. Aromatherapy going, soft music and lighting sets the mood. Then you get ready for the wax session. For me, the full Brazilian usually takes under thirty minutes in which she uses a combination of hard and soft wax. Jackie is quick, friendly and knows exactly what to say and do to make you feel comfortable about this intimate experience.

I began ordering drinks, and they were so much more affordable than what I had spent over the weekend on the strip. It was definitely refreshing to see some normal-ish prices. The bar was quick and efficient even though it was a very busy night. Cute blond bartender girls were very friendly. I kinda stuck around the bar for a while with my friend and she volunteered to be my wing woman. I thought this could potentially be a great idea. And there were plenty of pretty girls there, but I realized one thing in the middle of it... A lot of people there already knew one another.. Definitely a locals spot.

The thing I love most about Vegas, is just meeting random people from all over the country/world. And normally people on vacay are so much more open to meeting new people as well. The thing about local spots is a lot of girls and guys travel in packs and they already have their little clique. Even in big cities, this tends to be the case because people usually meet up with too many friends of the opposite sex. Although, I pretty much knew most of the relationships in the bar were platonic, I wasn't about to set the wrong jealous friend off. Plus I was having such a great time with my friend, drinking and dancing. She was a great hostess!!

The food was amazing!!! Butter Chicken was to die for. Not too tomato-ey, The sauce is a little more thin than Im used to , but the taste more than made up for it.

5963,2,1549756800000,"*sighs*  I had high expectations for the brunch buffet that Heist offers on Sundays. TI'll start with the good:

1.  Great for groups, beer, and dinner and lunch.  I've been here before for dinner and the food was really good.  

2.  Great location.  Love going to NoDa and the locals are really nice.  Love the people watching and the different groups of friends who gather there look like they're having a great time.

And that's about where the ""good"" stops.  The Bad:

1.  The entrance is a little confusing to find.  We went in the way that we normally go in and just stood there with waitresses and waiters flying past us as we looked like idiots.  I finally asked a waitress and she was kind and told us they changed the entrance to the other side outside.  -__- A sign on the front door would be helpful.

2.  We were sat in the main dining area which was packed and buzzing with hungry patrons.  That was fine.  The part that wasn't fine, was that our table didn't have silverware, and the waitress didn't come to even take our drink order until 10 min after we were sat.  Since it's buffet style, we knew we could just go get food but why go get food when we don't have silverware.  The table next to us had the same problem.  We decided to just get up and go get food since I was starving.  Came back to no still no silverware but the waitress got our drink orders...came back and still forgot the silverware.  -__-  When I finally got it, I pushed my now cold plate aside and we went and got more food.  

3. *sighs* The food offered in the buffet was....awful.  Scrambled eggs tasted like they were either liquid or powdered.  The baked brie tasted burned and the chocolate combination tasted like an accident.  Gross.  The salad and dressing were excellent so I filled my plate up with that.  The mussels were cold and just not tastey.  

Bottomless mimosas were $12 which we had read in a review that they were $10.  The buffet was $16 a person.  We walked out of there mad and had paid $80 for a terrible brunch experience.  Once the waitress took our drink order, her service was fine.  My thing is, if I am paying for dinner out- it better be good and worth my time and money.  That brunch experience was irritating and I wish we had gotten up and just gone somehwere else...like the table next to us...who left after not getting their silverware.  

I'll still come to Heist because they are good in other areas.  I just wanted my brunch experience to match the experience that I had when I'd gone for dinner. I think I saw that I could have ordered from a menu and I didn't have to do the buffet.  I should have just did that.",2

I ordered the fried chicken sandwich which sounded delicious on the menu. When it showed up, the chicken was one of those frozen particle chicken patties you find in the frozen food section and the bun was just a cheap burger bun. Definitely NOT worth the $15 price tag. I would've been more satisfied with a fried chicken sandwich from Wendy's because at least they give you a real chicken breast for a third of the price. It was like eating a big chicken nugget.

5990,2,1550188800000,"Originally, I was non-plussed about ordering from here, despite the great reviews and my husband's insistence. But my hubs has great taste, so I trusted his instincts. As always, he was right.

The Break Down:

We ordered online an orange chicken combo (wonton soup, rice, and egg roll) and shrimp chow fun, plus brown rice, for delivery. The website estimates delivery times will take 45 minutes to an hour, and it took a solid 45 minutes, so I wasn't unhappy about that - they were true to their words. For 6:30 on a Saturday, I thought that was super reasonable.

Now here's the thing: The other reviewers are totally right - GTB serves authentic Chinese food. Since it's authentic, it's dog-diggity tasty. Hands down, the best wonton soup of my life; tasteable sesame oil, flavorful, delicious pork in the wontons, plenty of fresh green onions (my favorite part)--it was a layered, delicious soup that I will happily order literally for forever. The orange chicken was cooked beautifully--saucy without being gross, not too spicy, and actually tastes like orange. Win! The egg roll was crispy, hot, and stuffed with goodness. Excellent. 

The chow fun. Guys, this is not a Chinese dish that you find at most fast-food Chinese restaurants (apparently). It was FABULOUS. I'd never had it before, but it's wide, flat, pad-thai like rice noodles (gluten-free win), cooked until tender, springy, and super slurpy. What a treat! This dish blew my mind.

The only downsides: The chow fun had only six pieces of shrimp in it - like normal-sized shrimp. So that was a downer. And the fried rice is NOT your normal Chinese fried rice. It's seasoned tastily and fried with egg, but has none of the standard American fare like peas, onion, etc. So that took me aback. The perfect brown rice more than made up for it though.

TLDR: Order from here. Do it. You will be delighted. I cannot wait to order from them again, though I'm now nervous at the impending relationship between my bank account and their kitchen.",2
5990,3,1551312000000,"We have an issue with All Stars Sports Bar. Make that two.

Firstly, just because you are one of the few liquor licensees within the airport, it doesn't give you permission to stock only the cruddiest of beers... Coors, Bud Light and Sam Adams. Oh please.

Secondly, the Wendy's fast food next door serves equal or better food than All Stars, for half the price and twice the efficiency.


So here's how I came to the above two conclusions...

Sunday early evening at PHX. It has been a long week in AZ, and I desperately wanted a beer and dinner before getting on the plane.

Just like when you're at any sports venue, I do expect to pay through the nose for that beer at the airport. But given my recent experiences, that beer does NOT have to be a cruddy mass commercial brand. 

Take note PHX - tiny little PDX serves local micro brew brands right at the gate. So does SFO. That is supporting local businesses and leaving your visitors with a wonderful last impression.

Next, the food. My expectations were low. I'm totally cool with burgers, hot dogs and fries. But when the burger patty came out, it honestly looked like a fast food burger vs. something I'm paying $15 for. That didn't bode well given there were plenty of fast food options I could have gone with.

The server was nice enough but not very efficient. She was holding my plastic silverware (oh yes, everything is served on plastic) WHILE talking to another customer. I was puzzled.

Bottom line: DON'T EAT HERE. Grab a to-go from the fast food or sandwich places. If you must have a beer, then go ahead... it's more about the experience of chatting with fellow travelers vs. getting an interesting beer.",2
5992,2,1550966400000,"Well, that was disappointing.

Tried the Avenue Club again last Friday night - for dinner this time. The Templeton rye old-fashioned press was still great, but the dinner...sigh. I ordered the pan seared walleye - something I've had other places and absolutely love. But this was just sad. It came with brussels sprout/radicchio slaw, sautéed green beans, and two small, smashed potatoes. All of the go-withs were sort of lumped together on the plate - and then the walleye was draped over the top. 

Now, wouldn't you think they'd serve that with the seared side of the fish up, so you could see that lovely brown crust? Nope. They put it seared side down, with a smear of tarter sauce over the top. So you had this utterly unappetizing, white and gray piece of fish (which I swear wasn't even a full filet) as the centerpiece of a lackluster plate. It tasted all right, but I had a terrible time getting past the way it looked. Think hospital cafeteria.

And frankly, it just isn't enough food. I found myself looking longingly at the plates of fish fry being carried to other tables, wishing for a do-over. I arrived starving and left hungry. Bread basket, please. Or something. Anything.

Also...6:30 on a Friday night and the place was not full. Food Fight needs to step up their game - or the Bubble Up Bar is going to go flat real quick.",2

The shop is tiny and cluttered and so a little kitchen claustrophobia can occur for those who suffer from such things, for myself it's a certain kind of restful to be bumbled along through narrow aisles imagining the many stylish ways I could be chopping, grinding, whisking and peeling things.

We've also been to the Tea Loft for wonderful, soul food brunches (a dearth in this area).

And then there are the teas. The owner is a tea aficionado and a very warm person and she will recommend flavorful teas from around the world for you to try. Hibiscus, green teas with fruit bits, spearmint teas--she knows them all and can also tell you about the health benefits of each.

The clerk (don't remember his name though) told us to slide our cards. The lady had asked the clerk who first? The clerk responded it doesn't matter. So I went and slid my card as my transaction was rang up first. I then noticed right as my card was charged it was for the lady's $20 worth for gas. The clerk did not know how to do the refund so he got his Manager Stephanie. Stephanie was very helpful and apologetic for the mistake and made the refund.

Then two days later I notice that the charge went through on my credit card. Franticly looking for the recipt which I could not find I drove to QT and spoke with Stephanie and she looked up the tranaction and found it and gave me copies of bothe the tranaction and a copy of the refund. I then went home and contacted my credit card issuer and was told from there end they show no refund. I then called the store and spoke to Stephanie again and told her what my credit caed issuer had told me and once again she was very apologetic and gave my QT's coorporate office number.

I went there last night (a Tuesday) to catch up with some friends. There was a sign on the door saying the draft machine was broken (booooooo). There was no hostess to seat me and I had to wander about looking for my friends. I'm guessing there were only 2 servers that night which was definitely not enough. After ordering our food (very mediocre fare) and drinks, we asked our server for separate bills. She just rolled her eyes and said 'uhm that's gonna take a while'. We chose to wait because we were really ticked off by that point. She brought some weirdly split bill saying her manager did not allow her to split items. When we tried to pay with our cards she said they didn't accept debit cards (huh?). Finally I ended up paying cash with the waitress glaring at me as if daring me to tip her less than 15%. 

I always ask myself after going to a new place, 'Would you come back here?'

NO!",2
6041,2,1549411200000,"Service varies depending on what shift you encounter. The seats located at the counter overlooking the boiling waters ready in anticipation for those fresh hand stretched noodles are great for a quick dine-in with free entertainment. The restaurant pulls fresh noodles during brunch/lunch hours so there won't be too much of a show at night. 

The food varies. If you're looking for authenticity, you may want to look elsewhere. If you're looking for good ol' American Chinese food, you've hit the jackpot. As someone who grew up in Beijing with Beijing comfort food as our nightly menu; take it from me, the food produced here is far from China quality. However, they (the restaurant) has well executed the concept of Beijing-style food and caters to satisfying American taste buds. 

Case and point? We ate at Beijin Noodle four consecutive days for lunch and dinner. At each meal, American's mostly ordered Kung Pao Chicken and Sweet and Sour Shrimp. Chinese don't really eat those dishes. Maybe American Chinese, but not Chinese from China. 

You're probably asking why we even ate there so many time in a row if the food was only ""meh."" Well, they had one particular dish that reminded me of grammy's cooking - sliced potatoes.  Each day I asked them to add ja tsai to the dish the way my grams did, and each time I ate the dish it nearly brought me to tears reminiscing of my 4' 3"" nai nai. 

So because of that one Beijing-style dish, I went nearly the entire time I stayed in Vegas.",2

Michael Todd's has such friendly staff and really great furnishings for really great prices.  I am currently in the market for an armchair, which I saw here back in December that I didn't get cuz I just can't buy furniture without having to think about it for a few weeks.  (it's a problem.  i'm aware.)  When I went back there today, as expected, the chair was no longer around, so I asked the staff about it.  They were quick to know which armchair I was asking about, and they said they would look into getting more.  Awesome!  

The prices here are really awesome, too.  For example, that chair that I'm interested in?  With tax included, the price would have been $248.  Nice.  Aside from furniture, they also have artwork created by one of the owners of the store, mirrors, lighting, and some bedding.

We started out with some Kumamoto oysters on heal shell which were on the small side. They were sweet & slightly briny but not even close in the intensity of flavor to the oysters we get back home from Hog Island (read my reviews). We then got the Terrine de four gras de canard. It was rich, creamy, & just the right amount of saltiness to go with the toast. We had some leftover which I ate with a croissant later in our hotel room...sooo good.

For main course I had the Scottish salmon which was cooked well & the lentils with ox tail was delightful & unexpected. The Boyfriend got the Rib eye steak special with a very nicely cooked steak. The creamed spinach was not too creamed which I liked. All in all, however, it wasn't quite worth its price of $65. Even though we stuffed ourselves full with the starters & the main courses, we still managed to sure some Bouchons which were not too sweet & went really well with the ice cream.

The service was fantastic; friendly, attentive, & efficient. It was the truly the best I've ever experienced.",2

Another plus is that they have horseradish cheddar cheese as an option, um yes!! I really enjoyed the burger I made and hope to make a totally different one next time. They have happy hour from 4-6 so that's basically the only time I would go since their drink prices aren't low. It did take a little longer than I liked for our burgers to come out (and we didn't get well done or anything) so that's why I only put 4 stars.

6096,2,1549584000000,"Randomly scrolling through Facebook one night last week, I saw a suggested post pop up for Izakaya Cocokala. They were getting ready to celebrate their 1-year anniversary, and to share that celebration they were offering 50% off all their ramen for the day of and day after the anniversary date. Being that they haven't got the best of reviews in their year of being open, they never really came into my radar, but I wasn't going to turn down trying some new ramen for an Abraham. 

IC is a fairly small restaurant. When you walk in, there's a limited seating sushi bar, a handful of tables...and that's about it. They also have two small tables kind of hidden in the back that I guess is either for overflow or private parties. It's a bit dark inside the restaurant, but it's clean and I like that they have pictures of pretty much all their menu items hanging on the walls throughout it. 

Their menu, which seems to have been updated at some point during the last year (according to friends who had been here prior) has a ton of different offerings. Most of the items are tapas style, but there's also some meals and a lot of single skewer items. They have a specials board that changes on a regular basis as well. One great feature of IC is that they give you a nice little bowl of complimentary edamame to enjoy while browsing the menu.

Since we were mainly here for the ramen, we kinda refrained from ordering much else. Although for just a couple bucks, we couldn't resist trying a wasabi chicken skewer and some bacon wrapped asparagus. The chicken was decent enough for me to want to try some other ones on a future visit, but I missed out on trying to asparagus since my son scarfed them up. Guess that means they're good too!

Their ramen choices are somewhat limited, but they offer a style I've never seen before. I actually ended up having to noob out and Google what Tsukemen Ramen is. They call it 'Red Impact' here, but what sets this style of ramen apart is that it's a ""dipping"" ramen. Basically you get all the classic ramen items like the noodles, bean sprouts, meat, eggs, etc on a side plate and then they give you a separate bowl of ""broth"" to dip it in. This one was actually a little more pricey at $6.50 with the 50% off, but it was worth every cent. Their broth is more like a sauce (obviously, right?), and it was visibly oily, but that ended up being a good thing. I chose Level 1 out of 4 possible heat levels, and while I personally could have went up a level, it had a decent amount of heat. The broth was all a little salty and a tad on the sweeter side, but the flavors mended together very well. Because it's a bit thicker and more oily, the noodles and other items seemed to really soak up the flavors well. The only thing that might be a downfall for some is that it's not quite as easy to sip on and take spoonfuls of like standard ramen broth. Overall thought this was an excellent bowl of ram and I wouldn't hesitate to spend the full asking price of $13 on it. 

The service was decent, but a little strange for me. We arrived about 10 minutes before our friends, and even though the place was nearly dead, I felt like we were kind of being rushed. They constantly looked at us and asked if we wanted to order stuff before the rest of our party arrive. Then throughout the rest of our meal, the servers stood like 5 feet from our table and just kind of stared at us and the other tables. I'm all for staying on top of things, but maybe back off on the creep factor a tad. 

I know I said it before, but due to their limited amount of decent reviews, IC wasn't really on my radar. And had I not seen their Facebook past, I'm not so sure I would have ever went out of my way to eat here, but I'm glad that I did. The ramen alone is enough to warrant a return visit, and the rest of the menu just looks too interesting to pass up. We shall meet again IC!",3

6122,3,1550016000000,"My wife and I had the good fortune of dining at Trentina about two weeks after it opened (about a year ago). We had the chef's tasting menu (the only thing offered at the time) and combined it with the wine pairings - suffice it to say, we thought it was terrific all the way around.

We finally had the opportunity to come back to Trentina, and while making the reservation I took a look at the interim comments and reviews from customers. While many were quite good and on par with our previous assessment of Trentina, I also noticed a good number of people who commented that the tasting menu (12 courses, mind you) had too little food and that they needed to get a fast food hamburger on the way home. While others complained about the wine pairings as providing little more than a single glass of wine throughout the meal. Naturally this concerned me as I wondered if Trentina had, in fact, declined in what it had to offer over the course of the past year.

Well let me put that concern to rest. Trentina is fabulous. Just fabulous. Those who complain about the size of the servings in the tasting menu (at the risk of being flamed) simply eat too much. And the wine pairings are one of the best deals in a prix fixe meal I've ever seen. I would estimate that there are 4+ glasses of wine worth throughout the meal, and they are varied, some unusual, and all delightful. My wife and I took a cab to the restaurant and then home. In fact, I would warn diners that if you get the tasting menu with wine pairings that you must have a designated driver, or take a cab/Uber home. Be safe.

So, back to the tasting menu. I won't go through everything, save to say that each course was unusual, well prepared, creative, and thoughtful on many levels. You may not prefer everything that comes to you (we all have different tastes), though the meal as a whole will be eye-opening, inventive, and memorable. There's nothing else like it in Cleveland.

When I called, they encouraged me to come early so that I could use the jacuzzi, steam and sauna. They mentioned it was coed so I should bring a suit.

For starters, the sauna was cold and the steam wasn't ""steaming"".. when I finally found someone to question about it, she said it goes on every 15 minutes, but she would check... Well, 20 more minutes later (total of 35 minutes waiting for the steam), there was no steam and the employee never came back to see if it was working.  The waiting area isn't your typical ""mellow"", relaxing ""holding"" area... First, there are men and women, which can be uncomfortable when you are walking around in a robe.. then, there are the employees banging things around and talking on their cell phones.  Not exactly relaxing. When I went to take a shower after my massage, there was nothing but cold water... just what I want after a relaxing massage.. an ice cold shower!... Needless to say, I found the overall experience very disappointing.  I will say, however,  that the massage was, in fact good.

This visit, we celebrated my daughter's birthday. The chef made a beautiful little cake and added treats that any kid would love! She felt very special.

Today, we walked a couple of blocks to the CN Tower and we wandered around town and it was so easy from the hotel. We are right in the middle of all the action.

Every time I come here, I love it more!",2

I ordered the Beauty & Essex burger which is short rib, brisket and lamb with goat cheese a tasty sauce and a side of BBQ fries. The food was tremendous probably had to be the best burger I have ever eaten. I would recommend this place to anyone that's looking for some good tasty eats. Thanks again Beauty & Essex I'm a local of Las Vegas I'll be back again.",2

6182,3,1549411200000,"When my wife gets nostalgic for those good ol' high school days, she always mentions that Serrano's was a frequent hang out with friends. She recalls the great bean dip and the tasty enchiladas as her meal of choice. Well, after the eventual buildup of wonderful Mexican food, it really is a disappointment to find such memories are best left in the past.

My wife and I went to dinner here when we first moved down to the Tempe area. It was a week day during the lunch hours. It's a dark lit restaurant for ""cosy"" evenings (as one of my fellow reviewers mentions). No complaints on the service side of things, but no standouts either. When service is just fine, I typically don't come back because I know there might be something better on the other side of town. 

When it comes to the food, I'll give some credit to the bean dip. However, seeing as an appetizer was the most enjoyable item eaten that night, you won't hear another compliment from me. The food I had heard so much about was bland, boring and down right meh. Don't expect to see me hanging around this restaurant as I'll be spending my money on good Mexican food.",2

You drive up thru the drive thru, cashier shouting ""can I help you"" and rushes you with ur order, then you drive up to p/up window and drive away with the wrong order :/ If I wasnt on my lunch break, I would have turn back to have the right order.",1

6200,2,1549584000000,"Pretty much as good as it sounds- no waiting in line, free entry (for ladies), and drink specials at many of the club offerings. If you're doing a weekend trip to Vegas and decide to ""wing it"" like we did for clubbing, then this is a great service. They're very flexible and can still get you on the list to most places even if you wait until the day of to put in your request. 

The first night you sign up for one of their promoted places (still excellent clubs) and the rest of the time you pretty much get your pick of the litter. Signed up at 2pm on Saturday for Ghostbar/Moon/View the same night. Within the hour I had a confirmation text for that night. Around 9:00 we changed our mind and decided to go to Hakkasan instead to see Tiesto, texted Chris if we could still have our picks for Sunday night, and not a problem. Second night, we found out our choice form the previous night wasn't available and were given 6 other options. Wanted to go to Pure, but the guest list had to be submitted by 7pm- they got us into Voodoo which is no where near the scale of Pure, but has an excellent city view from the rooftop of the Rio- plus a free drink at entry. 

Only minor downside is you can only get on the guestlist for one place each night

So overall, this is a great free service- I would especially recommend it to people who have never been to Vegas or don't have an itinerary in mind",2
6201,2,1550534400000,"It really pains me to give this place such a low review, but our experience today went from good to poor in a matter of an hour.  We walked into an empty restaurant around 3:00 this afternoon and were immediately greeted by an Asian man who was very nice.  The inside of this restaurant is very nice and very clean.  A nice guy filled up our water glasses and then we waited for our server to come.  About 4-5 people came in right after us and were also seated.  However, our waiter, Kevin, serviced the other two tables before us, even though we had come in first.  He finally came over to us and took our drink orders and appetizer order.  We received the appetizer and then he asked what we wanted for our meals.  After giving him our order, we started eating the appetizer which was a sampling of 5-6 items and it was delicious.  We then received our entrees (Panang Curry, Yellow Curry and 2 Pad Thai's).  Everything was cooked perfectly and was delicious.  We commented on how this was the best Thai food we have ever had in Arizona and how it would definitely be on our weekly list of restaurants to visit.  I even got ready to announce to all of my ""foody"" friends on Facebook who live in Arizona that this is a must place to visit.  Kevin did not really check on us after we got the food but did come to our table to bring the bill and box up our leftovers.  Judging by the service we received, I left a 10 percent tip because I felt it was a reasonable amount for the service he provided.  The service was good but certainly not spectacular.  Here's where the experience turned from good to poor.  After I paid the bill, our waiter, Kevin, came up to our table and asked me if there was something wrong with the service/food we received in which I replied, ""No, it was good"".  He then had the nerve to say to me, ""Well your tip was lacking"".  My group and I were completely blown away by his response.  For one, it was very unprofessional and two, very out of line.  I have never had a waiter say anything so rude to me in my entire life.  I was shocked by this guy's behavior.  We walked to our car and my group told me to go back and ask for a manager (I am not a confrontational person).  I called the restaurant after we left and asked for the owner, Deidre.  Her daughter answered the phone and said she really is never in.  She took my name and number and after about an hour, Deidre called me back.  She immediately asked how much I tipped then started to say ""15% is standard in today's industry"".  She also immediately started backing her waiter Kevin up by saying she knew him since he was 2 and that he was the hardest working person in her restaurant.  It is really hard to explain a situation to someone who only sees what they want to see and only hears what they want to hear.  I was ready to just hang up the phone because I really felt I was never given the chance to fully explain my side of the story.  I finally had a chance to explain and even though she said Kevin shouldn't have done what he did, she said she didn't want to pursue this any further.  It really is a shame that Deidre does not care about what her customers tell her.  Without feedback from customers, how do you expect to fix/remedy customer service issues?  I normally tip 15 to 20% at certain restaurants when the service is spectacular.  Today's service was not spectacular and there was no way I was going to tip higher than 10%.  I felt like Kevin acted like a spoiled brat and should really be ashamed by what he said to me.  There are so many other restaurants in Scottsdale who care about their customers and want to make things right.  We will not be returning to this place.",2
6227,1,1551139200000,"It's a Hilton and exactly what you would expect from a 3 to 4 star hotel. I haven't stayed in this hotel for years, but I'm glad I opted to come back.

We opted to upgrade to Resort Club status which gave us a bigger room with a 37"" flat screen TV, in-room printer, upgraded linens and pillows, and best of all.... we got complimentary access to the Spa. The Resort Club also gave us access to the Club Lounge between 6am to 8pm with complimentary coffee, tea, bottled water, bottled juice, sodas, fruit, nuts, and cookies. During the evening hours of 4-8pm, they even bring out various wines such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Chardonnay, Champagne with cheese as well as a selection of bottled beers. We got a room on the 24th floor near the lounge with a great view ot the LV Strip.

The Spa experience wasn't the best in the town, but I was able to relax in a quiet atmosphere. I especially liked the ""wet sauna"" which was almost like a dry sauna with some moisture. I liked the fact that it didn't dry out my skin, but at the same time didn't pump so much steam that it's difficult to breathe like it is in a steam room.",2

6236,2,1551225600000,"I really like this place.  It has a very European feel to it- go figure, I think it's a U.K. company.

I like how everything is always very neat and tidy, easy to find, and the people working there are quite friendly and helpful.  They have a simple, selection of good quality foods.  I don't buy huge quantities of food at one time, so I like that they package their foods in small quantities at fairly reasonable prices.  It's also pretty empty in there when I go, so I don't have to deal with big lines or crowded parking lots.

I will definitely go here again, although it's not somewhere I would shop every week because it's not super close to my house.",2

I was in a hurry and they over sold me a $50 charger. I returned today with my friend and the 2 associates, 1 of whom sold me the overpriced charger, did everything in their power to prolong the return experience. After 2 hours they were ready for my return. The woman who sold it to me was an absolute bitch. Despite the fact that she sold me the wrong charger she charged me a 25% restocking fee.

Okay, if I had to pick one thing... I would say if you're looking for a ""romantic"" dinner date setting, I would probably say this is NOT the place.  It's in the middle of a mall.  But, romance is what you create so to me, if the food is good and service is great, that's really what counts!  Our server was awesome.  He made great recommendations, was attentive, was kind, was not annoying in the sense that he was trying to recommend only the most expensive things.  He was honest about what was good and not just based on price.  The steaks were cooked to perfection and they are huge!!!  You can seriously share a steak.  Like really.  The sides were amazing and also huge.  I mean seriously... Truffle Gnocchi!?!?  Holy hell!  And Lobster Mash?!!!  Yes please!  And you need to save room for the butter cake. You just have to.  It was so good.  I mean like really good.  I don't know what else to say, it really was that good!",1

6248,3,1550188800000,"I always enjoy a little adventure, so this was the perfect activity. For CAD $225 (US $179.45), you get to walk around the edge of the CN tower for about 45 minutes. I thought it was a little expensive, but the exchange rates made it just a little better. (woohoo US currency...) 

If you wanna bring your GoPro and take some Instagram worthy photos, be ready to count on your tour guide to be your designated IG photographer. And yes, it's another CAD $25 to get all your photos from the experience on a USB stick. If you don't pay the $25, it's just a print of you at the edge and a group shot of you and the other people in your group plus a DVD with a video of the highlights in the 45 minutes.

As for teenagers, the requirement is at least 13 years old.  

My guide's name was Colin. He was a cool guy. Except I feel like he has done so many edge walk tours, he needs to boost his enthusiasm a little more instead of sounding like a happy recording tape.

However, they are serious when they mean ""samplers"", in which I finished the sampler and was still hungry.  Also it was super expensive! The food was great nonetheless and the presentation was meticulous.   We ordered the steak, which was huge and that filled me up.

There are a lot of great flavors to choose from at The Boba Tea House, but I would suggest the standard ""boba tea with boba"". Don't be freaked out by the tapioca at the bottom. It's sort of an acquired taste, but once you get into it, it's a beautiful and obsession.",2

6289,2,1550793600000,"Giving 5 stars to a chain pizza place does sound kind of ridic, right?  But, Jets - I can't resist! The 8-Corner pizza is probably the best big chain pizza I've had, ever.

It's horrible for you - but it's so, so, so good! The crust is that fabulous greasy, crispy that Pizza Hut of olden times used to have. The sauce is good and it's never been overwhelming. We've only ever had the Pepperoni (or the Spicy Pepperoni) which are both delish. They offer flavored crusts - my vote is the Turbo - it's a combo of the Butter, Garlic, and Romano.

It seems like at all times they are running an $11.99, 8-Corner special. Just tell them you have the coupon - they have never asked me for it.

The staff has always been friendly when I go in to pick up and my order has always been right (gotta knock on wood now, right?). We've had it delivered once and it was quick and still fresh!

A+ Jets, thank you!",2

I have tried the garlic and chive, maple/rosemary, chipotle and black pepper/onion. All were fantastic! 

Let's not forget the other half the meal. The sausages here are so juicy, I am getting cravings just thinking about them. I have tried the game meats Kangaroo, Rabbit and Venison. I liked Kangaroo the best with a topping of caramelized onions and sweet peppers. You can get a raspberry lemonade to go with it if you are looking for a sweet fizzy drink. I think I have said enough about the food. The service here always very efficient and friendly. I am in love with this place... can't wait to be back for my next wvrst!",2

The venue itself is rather large but they can arrange the stage closer or farther away depending on the size of the anticipated attendance.  

The only complaint that I have is they stopped selling alcohol at 9:30.  Also, the staff at the alchohol stations were operating very slowly.  The drink pours were measured which is to be expected but I would expect this to speed things up not slow it down.

This was frustrating considering part of the floor staff was not busy and just moved around without paying attention. We ordered multiple dishes and asked to have some served as appetizers to ensure we keep the most spicy ones for the end. Disappointedly, the dishes arrived out of order. For the good points, there is a large selection of sakes and other drinks at fair prices. The dishes are well presented and most are yummy without being exceptional. The venue is pretty big and can accommodate large groups with plenty of lengthy tables. All in all, this is a mixed bag and not among my favourite Izakayas.

I ordered the ginger beef, lemon chicken, cantonese chow mein and two orders of steamed rice.  Portions were nice and the food kept nice and hot while on the drive home.  

Ginger beef could have used a bit more spice and sauce and I wanted the cantonese chow mein with crispy noodles but was still ok.

We were catching a movie downtown, so we opted for water since we were driving. I was excited to see the menu, but to my surprise a few items are not on the menu any longer. :( 

I am never craving a burger but the Oz burger sounded really good, especially the pineapple aspect. It was sweet and savory at the same time.

But I will say the Oz burger is delicious! I was a fan of the fries as well, and the bun looked awesome nicely . My only compliant is there was a few items on the burger that were not listed on the description of the burger. (Asked the server if it had cheese and she said yes, I said no cheese. Burger came out with no cheese but with tomato) I feel like if you're going to list what's in it to make sure you list it all.

Could not have asked for a better Greek Salad definitely not stingy with the feta and the freshness of the salad in general.

It's a 24 hour gym. I only go here for 3 reasons 
1. Open 24 hours
2. It's cheap 
3. It's pretty close to my house

It's often extremely warm on the inside of the gym. Personally, I don't like to feel like I'm in a sauna as soon as I step in the gym. 

Equipment is frequently out of order. 

Also it's hard to find a spot to stretch a lot of times. 

They have classes but I have no idea if they still do them or what they are. I don't do them. 

During football season, a group of cheerleaders practice in one of their rooms. Dudes frequently stop working out to gawk at them. I don't care unless I want to use the equipment they're on. If you're a huge fan of watching dance/cheer routines, i think it's around 7:30 during the week

This mall is clean, GINORMOUS, lots of human traffic, and restaurants. It's decorated very nicely with glass doors, skylight ceiling, and great lighting. 

Food court is located on 1st floor, shops are located on 2nd and 3rd floor. 

Everything is a bit pricey in terms of food here, not sure how people can afford eating out here. If I didn't have an expense budget, i'd be depressed about food costs. 

Overall this place is a nice stop if you need to shop, but since i'm not a big shopping fan, it's not really for me.

There are a variety of soft drinks and juices on the refrigerators for those that don't drink coffee but we all know everyone drinks coffee!  They offer some craft beers with a respectable selection.  Oh yeah and they have wines but for some reason they are hidden away.  

There are several great sandwiches I can recommend but the Vito's Favorite is definitely my pick (minus the mustard they don't mention on the menu).  Another one you will not really care about but if you like Oatmeal try their irish blend which is my favorite with some expresso.

The wait staff never left us hanging for long. May have to order extra rice if you are like me and don't like soupy rice with my Curry.  The Thai tea was perfectly balanced and a good portion that lasted the meal.

6406,3,1550102400000,"The availability of the food and the varieties are fantastic. Even for non-sushi lovers, there are great choices! If I am craving sushi for lunch, this is the place to be as the cost does not leave a dent in your wallet in comparison to other sushi restaurants. 

The best thing about a buffet is not being pressured into eating everything. The whole all-you-can-eat always bothers me when those menus require: ""Must eat everything or you will be subject to an extra fee.""

Quality and taste is just so-so. I have had far better sashimi slices and rolls at the restaurants. Although having appetizers, warm food, and dessert readily available do make-up for this though.

If you're going for a good ratio of food-to-price for sushi, I would recommend going here.",2

Maybe it's because it was sorta cold and windy plus we were very tired from dancing all night, but their food was outstanding! Plus, I was among good friends/company and we ate a la family style. So, I guess my review is a bit biased due to other factors.

We got a big portion of calamari to start, which came with tomato paste on the side, something different. They brought out peppers in hot oil with the bread, they know me too well. To eat for our main dishes, I had the ""spaghetti alla chitarra"". You could tell the sauce and pasta were homemade, and so fresh! I've had the dish in the motherland, and it's almost comparable. The meatballs were a good size, and sooo yummy. 

The penne and grilled chicken was excellent. They used a sweeter sauce for the penne which complimented the chicken very well. 
 
The plates are expensive but they are well worth it. The place is small, but it's always the small Italian restaurants that have the best food! Customer service was excellent. We had no reservations, coming in to celebrate a special occasion for a party of four, and they accommodated us right away.

A couple of items on my wish list that I think they could improve:

- Invoicing: I wish they would show if you had a balance carried forward (or a credit) when they sent your next invoice.  It's a pretty standard invoicing practice!

- Sometimes it is tough to get through to their office - you often have to leave a message.  They are good about getting back to you, but I did have to be persistent when trying to get my dog into a waitlist for pack walks.

A tip if you don't have a reservation, if you arrive a few minutes before opening and wait in line, you can almost always get a seat at the bar and the bartenders are awesome.
The food is fantastic. I'm in love with the street corn. The description sounds a little scary (mayo in corn?!?) but it is delicious. 
We are also fans of their queso fundido. Super creamy, just the right amount of spice, and the warm tortillas are awesome. We could easily have made a meal of just the corn and queso. 
The tacos are fantastic as well, we've tried carnitas, pollo asado, and baja and all have been fantastic. They also run specials that change nightly.
The vibe here is dark and a little loud. It can be a bit difficult to see your feed or talk to your dining companions, not somewhere I would go for s romantic night out. But the music is normally awesome, and they have a few seats outside if you want to check those out.",2

6516,3,1550966400000,"I wavered between 4 and 5 stars here. If the rating was strictly based on food, I'd go with 5, easily. But, it's based on service, too, which is why I had to knock one off. Here's the deal...

I love Morton's. Its old-school interior and no-gimmicks shtick is awesome. Plus, of course, the food is fantastic. However, I wanted to branch out, and Ruth's Chris had some great reviews, so I utilized Yelp's oh-so-convenient Open Table reservation feature, and scored a table for two on a Saturday night. 

Our reservation was for 8:30. We arrived right on the dot, but were told to go to the bar and wait. So, my boyfriend and I both got cocktails -- he had Glenlivet, which is obvs hard to mess up, and I got the Peachy Pear-tini, which was delish. And then, we waited. And waited. Around 9, our table was ready. 

Our waitress was Kristen, and she was fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, witty, and knowledgeable about the food. Here's our food rundown:

- Barbequed shrimp app: I initially thought was BBQ sauce + shrimp, but it ain't. It's succulent li'l shrimp in a deliciously garlicky, white wine-infused sauce with a cayenne kick. Kristen suggested that we dip the bread in the sauce after the shrimp were gone, and we happily took her up on that. 

-Ruth's chopped salad: Holy crap. The most memorable salad of my life. I rarely rave about salads. In fact, I think this is the first time I ever have in my life. But, this salad was incredible! It has crispy onion strings on top, hearts of palm (which I love), and this amazing lemon-basil dressing, among other delicious things. So awesome.

- Filet mignon: My boyfriend and I both opted for the filet. I got mine with extra butter, he got his with a bleu cheese crust. Mine was phenomenal. The sizzling butter really adds an extra dimension of flavor that puts it beyond Morton's. My boyfriend found the bleu cheese to be a li'l too generous, and he wound up scraping some off, but still enjoyed it.

- Broccoli au gratin: Again, phenomenal. I've never enjoyed broccoli so much. Granted, it was swimming in bubbling, gooey cheese...

- Potatoes lyonnaise: We took a risk here, as many people rave about the garlic mashed potatoes, and we saw mountains of them carried past our table. But, it paid off big-time. These were, hands-down, the BEST lyonnaise potatoes EVER. Pamela's has nothing on these. Every mouthful was a medley of crusty brown potatoes and caramelized onion goodness. I dream about these potatoes.

So, based on that experience, we went back again the next Saturday. Different waitress, same food (literally, we ordered exactly the same items, 'cause they were so damn good). I don't remember the waitress' name that we had the second time, but we waited longer for food to appear, were checked on far less, she took the cocktail shaker with my extra martini in it before I'd gotten to pour it in my glass, our steaks were not done correctly (he got my medium-rare, I got his medium-well), and it took forever to get the check. I really think it ruins the experience when you're done eating and ready to go, and you're just sitting there, drumming your fingers, looking around the dining room and wondering, ""Where the hell is the waitress with our check?"" 

That said, we will definitely be back. We'll just request to be seated in Kristen's section! :)",2
6521,3,1550793600000,We decided to eat here before a show at the Mirage. As a result we were early by LV standards. We had the Linguine with Clam and the breaded veal chop. The veal was very bland and really needed a sauce. The food was well prepared but not outstanding. The service was almost intrusive. The waitstaff and bus people literally hovered over our table. I understand that this is a relatively new restaurant and just probably needs to work the kinks out. Overall I would recommend it as long as you expect pleasant but not exceptional food.,2
6525,1,1549584000000,"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. Definitely recommend showing up earlier if you're with a group to grab a table. The brunch can also take a few minutes to be finished as well, so arrive ready to wait (but I promise it's worth it!) 

The whole place is close to a cafeteria style where you order at the counter and go get your food when it's ready to take to your table. 

They had an amazing array of baked goods and tons of fresh squeezed orange juice. (I didn't grab any but I'm going back because the cookies looked mouth watering.)

Their brunch menu had things like lemon ricotta pancakes and Norwegian eggs benny on it (I will come back to try the pancakes for sure.) 

I had the breakfast burrito, which was vegetarian to my surprise! It had scrambled eggs, refried beans, guacamole and sour cream. It was super delicious and I would go back to eat 20 if I could. 

My friends each got dishes involving eggs and all loved them too.

The two women who did our nails were nice, but the lady who worked on my friend's nails was much more meticulous, taking time to make sure she was happy with everything. The lady who worked on my nails went through everything quickly, resulting in very thin polish application which began chipping just later that day. I wasn't as happy with my nails as with other places I have gone before, but I feel like it was a hit or miss situation based on the person I got. 

One thing that I enjoyed about Nailing more than any other place I've gone, however, are their massage chairs. They are incredible and have like a million functions. Best massage chairs I've experienced at any mani-pedi place thus far.",2

My husband and I aren't too familiar with Indian food so we didn't really know what to expect... pleasantly surprised would be a complete understatement. It is a small, cozy, and warm environment. We were immediately greeted by who we think was the owner. He was extremely friendly and informative for newbies like us. He suggested the kameer rather than the hot and sour chicken. Boy oh boy were we glad that he did. It was one of the best dishes I've tasted! 

We were super excited to try the naan after reading all of the reviews. Everyone was spot on! So delicious! 

At the end of the meal he surprised us with a generous sampling of the rice pudding. WOW! IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD! :D

Needless to say, we will be back very soon to enjoy more delicious samosas, pakora, kameer, naan, and excellent rice pudding. I would have rated 6 stars if I had the option.

Yakitori is a bit disappointing because of the taste of most of them. I tried the eel, it tasted weird.  The chicken oyster was ok.  Chicken wings are by far the best, but you can do a outdoor picnic and grill as many as you like, it's good but it's normally good anyways. Chicken liver is ok, the 2 we ordered were different because one was overcooked the other was the opposite.  Pork belly was ok.  Lamb chop was not as good as grilling at home.  Overall the BBQ taste was not strong as expected.  When you order a lot then it adds up to be quite expensive. 

Original pork ramen has so much fat in it, I'm not the only one who cannot stand the ramen.

I am only giving this location a 4 star because I have been here multiple times and have been pretty satisfied with the breakfast.

The parking could definitely be better...There is a sign that says $5 non-refundable, but if you go through the front of the garage and let them know you're a hotel guest they'll waive it.  When we originally arrived and entered the back lot, they just made us pay and didn't mention it was free for hotel guests. 

The desk service was very nice and check in was quick and easy.  The room we stayed in was not even stayed in yet, so it was nice to have all new amenities. The air conditioning was FREEZING cold, but it was a nice change to the 112 degrees outside. No comforters on the bed, and when I called for one, they said they didn't have any but brought up a blanket.  Also, there were no ice machines, we had to go down to the bar, and the bartenders were not happy about filling hotel ice buckets.  The elevators were still being renovated, so they were pretty messy but hopefully they'll be better. 

I didn't use the cable, I mean c'mon I was in Vegas! :)  But the casino seemed decent. Hash House A Go Go is right downstairs, and I hear they have the best breakfast in Vegas (I didn't make it this time, but will give it a shot next time).  We saw a new Hawaiian restaurant opening and a Subway.

I know that when I was a GM at a dealership 20 years ago and this happened heads would have rolled.",2
6647,3,1549584000000,I love Rio Coffee! Their daily flavored coffee is as good as I've ever had anywhere. They offer a great variety and their prices are fantastic. The staff is very friendly and quick to offer suggestions. They have a nice extensive menu with many different choices - including low-fat options. They also deliver! My only complaint? They don't offer Dave's Homemade Chili year round. Rio = my favorite coffee joint!,2
6657,1,1549411200000,"After coming here a few times, I am ready to write a review for Sweet Note Desserts!  Sweet Note Desserts is located right at commerce plaza on Highway 7 and hidden near the back of the plaza.

I have been searching for a place that makes good Soufflé for the LONGEST time in Toronto.  Ever since the delicious one i ate in Hong Kong Shangri-La Hotel, I failed to find anywhere that can make a Soufflé close to the caliber I had in Hong Kong!  I am happy to announce that Sweet Note Desserts is the place I have been searching for for the last few years! 

Before I get into the food, I want to mention this cafe style desserts place is very cozy, I liked the chair and the colour they used in the place.  They also serve variety of coffees and teas which is perfect with desserts.

Now let's get to the desserts part, between the chocolate Soufflé and the Regular Soufflé, I recommend the regular Soufflé because it's more natural and the puffing last longer.  I do not use any of the ""dipping"" sauce it comes with it because I feel it destroys the flavour of the Soufflé.  The inside is warm and soft and makes you love every scoop of it!  Just a warning, they make their Soufflé fresh when you order, so it will take at least 20 minutes!

We also tried the Baked Alaska and I have to say, that sesame ice cream wrapped with a cream outside looked SOOOO good, and it tasted great too!!  Get a dessert and a latte or tea and that makes a happy late evening!

If you love desserts, this place is a must-check-out!  Just a warning again, they make most of their desserts right at order, so you may need to wait a bit so make sure you have time to enjoy your time here!!",1
6661,1,1550880000000,"This was my first time at Sauce. My boyfriend and I tried two different pizzas, both of which were delicious. The toppings worked so well together and the crust was chewy and just perfectly golden brown. I will definitely be back to try some of the other signature pizzas!",2

I ordered the Strawberry Milk Tea & my mom ordered the Mango Smoothie and both were great choices. The mango was super fresh too! Love the atmosphere and how cute the interior is decorated. They really mantain cleanliness. Definitely an instagram worthy place to snap a pic!,1
6667,2,1550620800000,"heard about this from a few colleagues and tried it out. we ordered soup dumplings, cold sesame noodles, hot spicy wonton noodles, potstickers, 5 spice eggplant. Def not small portions so I would recommend only ordering a couple of smaller dishes or 1 entree.

6670,3,1549584000000,"Came here for hotpot tonight, it was all you can eat for 23CND. Quality of meat and vegetable were really good for all you can eat. Good cost-performance. Hotpot is especially good for freezing Alberta weather. Tried the pork paste for the first time, it was tasty. 

Will come here for dim sum soon and will report back.

Service wasn't bad for a Cantonese restaurant, typically, in Cantonese restaurants waiters ignore you, but at this place, they actually came around and asked us how we were doing. Plus, we negotiated and got free sweets after the meal.

Came back tonite for dinner, got the Ginger Salt Chicken Hot Pot (see picture uploaded), holy cow, it was AMAZING. The chicken was free range, thus, the meat had the ""elastic"" quality. I don't know what other words I can use to describe the texture of free range chicken. The soup had the ginsing herbal flavor which I enjoy. This dish is highly recommended by me, especially in the cold Calgary winter.",2
6673,3,1549756800000,"Able to walk-in, table for 3 at 6PM on a Tuesday evening. Good thing we stopped by early, the place was *packed* by the time we left.

What I wish I knew before I walked in: the appetizer portions are generous, almost huge! For a light meal or small-portion eater, they are just right as an entree. I ordered the gnudi with mushrooms, spinach, walnuts and peccorino. Delectable 1"" bites filled with light, airy cheese (ricotta?). There were 4 or 5 gnudi, plenty of mushrooms, rich broth. Would be great with a soup or salad to make a meal. 
Also to the table: steamed mussels- HUGE mussels, heaping huge portion; veal meatballs. 

I got the roast chicken over oat risotto; the risotto was interesting, I liked the creamy texture, but it had been salt-bombed :( Chicken was nicely seared, skin on. But cold. 
Also to the table: duck with cherries and the cioppinno. Thumbs up from both diners.

Service was excellent; 3 stars for the cold chicken and over-salted risotto",1
6678,3,1550448000000,Lots of tourists that have no idea what they are doing but they keep a few booths open just for locals. I love that- no waiting in line behind some guy from China that never held a gun. I just want to shoot some stuff so move over! Good deals for locals and women. It's expensive if you don't get a deal. The range is clean and staff is great. No testosterone overload like the gun store on Tropicana.  Here the staff actually wants you to have fun. That's all I gots!,2

6705,1,1549065600000,"AWESOME first experience horseback riding! It's $55 for 1.5 hours and $65 for 2 hours. Definitely take the 2 hours to get the full experience. Since most of us are beginners, we didn't get to gallop through the dessert like I wanted to. I guess it would hurt too since cacti are all around. Remember to wear closed shoes (duh) because I didn't and I had to be uber careful that a cactus didn't go through my toe.

Anyway, they don't really prep you too much which is good so they don't waste your time. They just let you know how to steer and control the horse. You ride in a line so that the horses know where to go. You roam through the dessert and the best part was going through the water. The horses were so obedient and trained that nothing went too off course. The horses will want to randomly eat, pee, or take a fat dump so you may randomly jolt to a stop!

Besides going through water, the best parts were the uphills so the horse would gallop up!! That's when you finally get what you wanted, bouncing up and down on the wild beast with your butt flying up!! 

Great guides and beautiful place. Lots of horses. I was teamed with my buddy BJ. I miss BJ.

6710,3,1550534400000,"Wurst is the best ( German beer hall ) that I have been to . I went here sight unseen for my GF's Friends birthday or something like that , the details escape me . I was met by a pleasant atmosphere and the sight of people drinking out of shoes....then it hit me that's no Shoe that's DAS BOOT ! and I must have one. 

I ordered a boot of a delightful Pilsner and was given the option of plastic or glass; I opted for the Glass (50$ deposit ) because I'm not a child and It's hard to impress total strangers with your drinking prowess if you're imbibing from what amounts to a sippy cup. 

If you are a fan of  various organ meats in intestinal casings then you will love the menu because it's pretty preserved meats and sausage heavy. I ordered wings and was treated to this bizarre chicken wing/ sausage on a drumstick concoction. 3 to an order , pretzle breaded, covered in hot sauce and massive in size, oh and actually pretty tasty.

The Polka band touring around was great ! it added so much to the ambiance and through the bleary beer induced haze was probably more enjoyable then it should have been.

6713,2,1551225600000,"They left a flyer on my door, so I thought I would give them a try. Not that great at all, I have to wonder if these recipes are even from Greek people. I ordered the tabouleh salad which had no parsley and was nothing but cracked wheat. The pita bread was fresh and they gave us a lot of tzatziki, so that was good. The classic gyro was alright but they do skimp on the meat, and after having George's Gyros off of McKellips, there is no comparison.

I'll stay at Pita Jungle for now, like others have said on here, cheap, late night after drinking food, as a maybe, and that's a big maybe at best.",1

6723,1,1550620800000,"Maaaaaaan.....

Let me start off by saying that I'm not a big hot pot fan. I live my pho and my boiled greens with pork but I just can't get into hot pot. With that said, I came here for the sushi so stop with what you're thinking in your head.

My cousin came into town so on his last night, we came here before he left for home. Some of the other guys in the party had already been here but this was my first. There were 8 of so we got 4 hot pots and 4 sushi so we could all enjoy it without them having to watch over us and us having to watch over our shoulders. It worked out great. I don't know if they offer anything else besides the ""buffet"" deal but it's gotta suck being the sushi chefs at a ""buffet"" place like this. The hot pot menu is pretty vast from what I saw. The sushi menu is pretty standard fare, as I would expect. Selection wise was a lot better than I had expected though. You get to choose from sashimi, nigiri, hand rolls, and rolls. They even offer Hibachi dinners you can order. The portion on that is rather small but it's fine as it's a all you can eat. Overall, I was pretty impressed but I don't know if I ate my money's worth. I only ordered sushi and it took forever to come out. While waiting, I ate some boiled meats since I was hella hungry.

Would I come back? Maybe. I'm coming from Akron so it's a long drive after pigging out. I was told there's actually a 2hr time limit for customers but with how long it takes for sushi to come out, I would hate to get booted because of the time limit and more than half of it was spent waiting for my food. Again, we came in a SLOW weekday night and we waited a bit. I can't imagine the wait on a busy day.",3
6723,2,1550102400000,Okay food...nothing special. The last time we ate here everything tasted very salty. Our waitress was very nice and the overall decor is cozy. This isn't an authentic Irish Pub. This is the Irish version of the Olive Garden. Keep that in mind when you visit.,2

Ok, so I am waiting for my MRI and decided to live post my review. 

I had an 8:30 pm MRI appt. on a Friday night. No one is here. They called the 1 person in the waiting room back at 8:40. I am live posting this review at 9:30 pm, an hour after my appointment time, still waiting. They told me I'd be here until 9:30. They have zero customer service. No one has said, ""sorry we are running so far behind"", not a hint of caring. I hope the image they produce is better than the image they present. Go somewhere else, they need a customer service makeover. Badly!!!

In this state of ridiculous liquor laws, it's a feat to have so many beer options in singles and make-yer-own six-paks. They have chilled choices (or a super-chiller if you want to cool something quickly)  and non-chilled options. There are over 1000 varieties, and the awesome ""Beer Manager"" has the whole inventory all in his head! And he gives helpful recommendations.

The food is good too. The wings are great, and the fries and chips are delish. I'm not a hot dog person so I can't comment on them, but the husband loves them. They're Chicago-style with Chicago-branded meat and buns. Authentic!",2

6752,1,1551052800000,"One Sunday morning the monthly brunch crew decided to check Bouchon off of our list. It was a gorgeous morning as we made our way up the elevators. It's in a weird spot, but super easy to get to from the self parking garages. We were promptly seated on the patio. It featured a really cool little courtyard with a neat view of the hotel, since you're basically on a rooftop terrace in the middle of it.

We were not super impressed with their drink menu and had to ask if they had regular mimosas, for us basic girls. They did indeed but didn't include them on the menu, they only put their fancy drinks on there we were informed. We ordered an assorted pastry basket and some beignets because that's how we roll. We were informed by our waiter that they were established as a bakery so we definitely made a good decision. He gave us some choices and we settled on a cheese danish, some raspberry beignets, a chocolate almond croissant, and a cinnamon roll. The danish was meih, it wasn't traditional, was super flaky, and had a pile of frosting like cheese on top. I quickly moved on to the beignets, they were good but more like raspberry filled donuts, I wouldn't call them beignets, I mean they had granulated sugar on top, not even powdered sugar! The cinnamon roll was good, but would have been better heated. The surprise of the century for me was that my favorite pastry was the chocolate almond croissant. I could have easily eaten three by myself, but I settled for about half, since I had to share with 3 other ladies. The pastries were good, but not amazing. They were delivered with some fresh baked bread. The bread was delicious and I loved that it looked like leaves on a stem, it was easy to rip off a hunk for yourself. 

We moved on to real food! The omelette of the day sounded amazing, but I really wanted some fries so I settled on the Croque Madame. It was delicious and I scarfed it down without complaint. The fries were also great, just a little over salted for my tastes, but I love a good fry.

One of the biggest things that I loved about this place when I was a kid, was watching these being made- the process is mesmerizing. 

I also love their Madeleines! Although they are not the traditional shape, they are deliciously buttery and are incredibly velvety. You should also give their pancakes a try! The red bean is yummy, but my favourite is the brown sugar and cinnamon. The only thing about these pancakes, is that I recommend you buy them immediately after they are made. They have to come off of the stove, and at that point they melt in your mouth. If you buy them prepackaged, they aren't as good!",1

6781,1,1550016000000,"Came to this place because it reminded us of Kang Ho-Dong Baekjeong korean bbq back in California.   I actually think this place was better.   Inside it has a feel that you are in Korea.   Inside how its designed its like your in a korean village but your inside of a building.   They have street lights and different sections of the restaurant to look like buildings.   

We got the small combo meal (way big enough for two people) off the menu and you get two choices from two parts of the menu.   We got angus short rib and aged short rib.   On top of the meat you get the small side dishes, a bean paste stew, steamed egg, vegetables, cheddar cheese, and a rice pop icecream.    If you get the ribs you also get 6 rice balls with wasabi.  You put the wasabi on top of the rice and the meat on top and then dip the rice ball in you sauce.    This was so good.   

The meat was flavorful and tender.   Our waiter I can't remember his name but our receipt said his name was ""Tu"".   He was awesome and super attentive to our table.  You couldn't ask for better service.  

And at the end we got our rice pop icecream.  The only downfall is that you can only pick one flavor to share per every two people because it's huge and cut in half to share between each other.  We got strawberry.   But they have vanilla, mint and cookies-n-cream.  They had some more flavors but I can't remember what they were.  I would definitely be back.",3

There was not much flavor to it, just a ton of sodium from the soy sauce. The veggies were old and mushy and were probably from the beginning of the day. The gyozas were alright, nothing special and did not taste that fresh. The wasabi mayo sauce was very good but the ""soy sauce"" was sorta weird, not sure what to make of it.

The food was great and it was nice getting away from the craziness of Vegas for a little bit without breaking the bank.

Sadly, we were seated by a group of young drunk guys who were spilling their drinks and being loud and rude to the waitstaff. If we didn't have the misfortune of this, I would give the place 5 stars. I understand that this is more common when you're in Vegas, but I have to judge the overall experience fairly, and with the place being so small in size, it was very hard to ignore..

6813,1,1551139200000,"Checking out Le Reve. The presentation is very nice and enjoyed seeing the mist and music prior to start. 

Overall the theatre is nice and has a very appealing setup for the show that's being presented. Everything is nicely laid out.

As always they inform the audience that the show should not have any flash photography or recordings. However you have a few who just fail to listen. I've been to several shows and this one was by far the worse when it came to guests snapping pictures and recording. Throughout the show all you could see were flashes from phones, cameras and iPads. It was extremely distracting from what we paid to see. 

The show however was great. By far one of the best shows I've seen in Vegas. The cast did an amazing job and stunts were intensely great. We had seats that were in the front row and I was worried that I'd miss taking in the entire performance. Our seats were great, and I even got splashed on a few times from the performers. I recommend you check this show out if you've not seen it and I'd even it put it ahead of some of the Cirque shows.",3

6841,2,1550188800000,"As everyone knows, there are TONS of shows to choose from on the Las Vegas Strip. Cirque de Soleil is amazing, but after seeing a couple dozen shows over a couple of dozen years the lines begin to blur a bit between Viva and O. And really, how much Britney can one person take (oops, never mind...I never did it a first time)?

Sooooo, I was seeking out something a little different to attend and came across the Zombie Burlesque show in a local mag. My husband is a Zombie fanatic and I happen to have an admiration for the act of Burlesque so I thought I'd buy tix as a surprise. No surprise...the hubby apparently likes Burlesque as much as I do - lol! 

The show's storyline...well...who cares really...some post- apocalyptic something. The MC/host is a charming and very talented gentleman who warms up the crowd with his banter and jokes, and seamlessly choreographs one act after another. There is some zombie penis eating - ""Eating penis doesn't make you gay!"" (yes, if you're curious, they do sell the soundtrack on CD) - lots of bitty booby shaking, tastelessly tasteful audience interaction and even participation (that poor, newly married guy with the UofTexas T on that was pulled onto the stage and strapped in for...some fun- hahaha), great dancing and acrobatics, and even hilarious bottle of vodka and Jello box intercourse...followed by a comp baby Jello shot for everyone in the crowd. 

Very, very entertaining on all fronts. Uber talented cast, including the live mini-orchestra that provides the accompanying tunes. And funny - keep an open mind and leave any judgment at the door! I certainly got a bit of a [well needed] ab workout! 

Bottom line: If you like to laugh, enjoy great singing numbers and dance performances, and are up to a bit of kink included in it all, Zombie Burlesque is THE show for you! The most fun I've had in Sin City for 100 bucks and no STDs (Stupid Tourist Don't's) in a long time. As a bonus, Zombies and T&A for the hubby won me major wifey points, so I think I'm set for the rest of the year. ;) Worth every penny spent. Have fun! 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

TIPS: *Some of the cast members come out afterward to meet and greet and provide some great photo opps, so don't run away so fast after the show.
 
**When booking online and employing promo code YELP50 the price was only $99.98 inc. tax for two VIP admission. Seats D4&5 right in the middle - could have been closer but you have to kind of look up at the stage.  The theater is quite small so I'm sure you can see from the slightly less expensive non-VIP; however, in my opinion you just won't have the same overall experience outside of the first 10 rows or so. It's good to be ""up close and personal"" - trust me.

***You can pre-purchase a large cocktail (i.e., vodka, run, etc. with mixer) with souvenir glass in advance via phone - ~$7 savings. Beers are same price at the bar. 

****Theater located inside Planet Hollywood ALL the way in the back left corner, so be sure to allow yourself time to make the trek through the entire resort to reach your destination.

That said, the Crab Stuffed Chicken they have for dinner here was one of the most divine dishes I have ever had. The night I came here for dinner (it was a work thing), I was under a great deal of stress, and I normally get appetite loss when I'm anxious, however I could not stop taking more bites of that incredible meal. Before I knew it, my plate was empty and I regretted not having slowed down to savor it. But whatever, c'est la vie!

6865,3,1549670400000,"Was there for a business lunch meeting.  I ordered their Mexican Tostada Salad that had (among other things), turkey on it (you know, as the main protein for the meal).  I don't think there were even 2 tablespoons of shredded turkey in the whole thing.  But, kale.  Lots and lots and lots of kale.  Including lots of inedible kale stalks.  For $16.99 I expected a lot less filler and a lot more of the protein part.

The food took forever to arrive.  The person I was with ordered an omelet, which showed up first, unceremoniously, and with no indication when mine would arrive (which, fortunately, wasn't long after).  It was dropped off without a word.  Our server DID NOT CHECK ON US ONCE during the entire meal.  She did not ask how everything was when she came to clear the plates.  She brought the bill and the debit machine without asking if we were ready for it - basically as if she were trying to get us out of there.  The restaurant wasn't that busy and there was no call for that.

The dynamite roll is really delicious and also kind of unique as they put sweet potato in it. Filling, but I'm not going to complain because I love that stuff.

Unfortunately, they apparently set thermostat in hotel to incorrectly report temperature.  I set temp low for sleeping, awoke due to it being very warm, although thermostat said it was still at the temp I set earlier - incorrect.  I don't like misleading practices like this.  On checkout, the staff said I should have contacted them! It was 3am in the morning, not exactly the time you want to sit around waiting for someone to show up to override the thermostat to operate correctly.  Southpoint is a nice hotel, disappointed they play this apparently somewhat common game with room temperature.

UPDATE: Southpoint contacted me and addressed the problem.  So, given that, I'm good, and will visit again (as I have so often in the past).  I should have mentioned in the original review that their Primarily Prime Restaurant is superb - it's actually a reason to visit.

The hotel room was so-so.. it still had a little bad smell to it. The bathroom was nice, it's just that the tub/toilet was too small and it was a little dim in there too.
If you are staying here during the weekend, be aware.. it is extremely loud from all the music from Fremont, it still goes on at 3am.  The front desk people are rude and careless. The parking was inconvenient as well; you can park in the parking garage, but it was always full and you have to walk a couple blocks down to get to parking.

Caring, responsive... and I'm not a pregnant woman and I get the idea most of the clients are.

6984,3,1548979200000,"I had been really tempted to try this place, after I learnt of it on Yelp. Store is located under the Emerald Park condo and shares the floor with many other eateries.

The owner was very friendly. As I walked in, he greeted me with a smile. He introduced me the products they have to offer, which are frozen yogurt, popsicle and milkshare (all made with frozen banana) He also offered a few samples for me to try. I purchased two single servings: strawberry funshine and nana-pick (should be of chocolate, can't recall the ingredients exactly) 

I have to say, this store is Independent (I assume it is) so it has to have something special to set itself apart from other dessert franchises/chains. The taste is great, store clean and service top-notch, but I do find the price to be a little high (4.99 for a single serving) for what it is and wonder how many people would go for it.

Disregard the interiors, the place needs an overhaul but the food and top notch service makes up for it.

Their pho is delicious, deep, authentic broth, full of flavour and delicious fat. My pick for pho is the BBQ beef pho, the char from the beef adds a delicious smoky taste to the broth. Their bun dishes are also very good and super cheap. I'm partial again to the BBQ beef bun but always get it with sugarcane shrimp. Their cold rolls are chalk full of huge butterflied shrimp, tons of pickled carrot/daikon and glorious mounds of thai basil. The spring rolls are a bit hit and miss, sometimes arrive perfectly fried. other times super soggy with grease. Still worth a try.

The Perch perfectly bridges the gap between high-end ""fine dining"" and ""a casual evening out"". The food is what you'd hope to find at any great restaurant, but the vibe is European café casual.

Outstanding service. 
Our server, Dante was awesome. Friendly and having a comprehensive knowledge of the menu; he was able to offer excellent recommendations. Food was served promptly, but service was not rushed.

Outstanding Food. 
Our Calamari appetizer was great - with an unusual but delightful dipping sauce.
My date had the Salmon - served over brussel sprouts (which he instantly declared to be the best he'd ever had).  

I had the Turkey French Dip - just 'cause it sounded interesting. It was better than I had hoped - with a delicious dressing that involved caramelized onions and a little horseradish. It was served with truly killer French fries.  Yeah, I could eat my weight in those.

Outstanding overall experience.
A perfect evening at a charming restaurant with a fantastic staff. 

One consideration: Be aware of whether or not there is a band on the nearby stage when choosing to sit inside or out. The night we were there, the duo ""Orange Feathers"" was playing. Talented guys, and they kept it to a reasonable level. However, it would be easy for things to get overly loud if you are sitting near the speakers.

Fair Disclosure: I had an earlier experience here that ended in us bailing out due to issues with staffing. On this, my second visit, they more than made up for that earlier snafu. 

At any business, things can happen that are truly beyond control. Sudden rushes; staffers bailing, supplies not coming in - it happens. What is important is *how* the establishment handles these unexpected moments. 

General Manager, Kristine has my total respect and admiration for her diplomatic and friendly response to my initial concerns. Well done, and Thank You!

First, I got an impression that they don't like us. I was with my sister and my 10years old nephew. We arrived a bit earlier than the opening time. I told them I will move to the restaurant area when they open and sat in the cafe area with my sister and my nephew. I Ordered a muffin which was good while waiting. When they opened the restaurant area, the server asked us to sit in the cafe seat where we just left. It was not a dining area and I got an impression that they don't want my nephew to sit in their dining area. Well, though my kid was not screaming and running across the restaurant, but we were seperated from other mature customers. 
Second, the food that I ordered arrived a bit slow. I ordered a a pan of pizza, a steak with grilled potatoe and a poutine. Pizza was so so. Steak was just fine. I prefered the potatoe in the side wich was grilled with duck fat. And the poutine..... The portion was large, covered with bland gravy and cheese which was challenging to consume. It was my first time to try poutine, so I can't compare it with the best one but anyway I don't think I will try poutine again.  And in the end, after receiving the bill added with tax, I thought I won't recommend here to someone who likes to have tasty food with children in affordable price.

7025,1,1549152000000,This place has slowly improved over the years. I came during their grand opening and had a horrible experience with expensive and small portions.  My second time was about a year after that and there was dramatic improvement.  The Korean chirashi was only $10 - cheapest I've had.  The portion was large but the salad part was mostly cabbage which is unusual and didnt taste as good.  Came back tonight (2 years later) and there was further improvement. That same Korean Chirashi had large slices of sashimi and some cabbage but this time lots of real mixed greens.  This time the amount of sweet spicy sauce was way too excessive and drowned the salad.  Their sauce is also sweeter than I prefer so I will need to ask for the sauce on side next time like how it is usually served. Easy fix and still cheap $11.  My tofu soup was decent and only $8.99.  Not sure if I like it enough to be back but it's a decent place overall.,2

7041,3,1550534400000,"I was thinking about it, and it doesn't feel fair to give this place a 3-star review considering how often I've frequented the joint since my previous review.  However, it still has problems that keep me from giving it a solid 4 stars.  I mean, the food is amazing.  There are few places in the city that have a mac and cheese that is both this easily accessible AND delicious.

My big concern with the Chickery is that it doesn't seem to have any idea what it wants to be, and the overwhelming struggle to fit in is apparent every time I go in.  Since the store opened, the inconsistency in service, portion sizes, and meal choices is confusing for me as a customer.

I value consistency in a food establishment.  I admit that I'm the kind of person who will get the exact same thing every time I go to a restaurant because I know I love it and I know that I won't leave disappointed.  There was a chain restaurant that I used to go to 1-2 times a month, and I would order the exact same thing every time I went in.  When they pulled that particular item from the menu I wrote corporate (naturally), and upon finding out that it was gone for good, I literally stopped going to this restaurant.  Forget that there are other items that would no doubt be tasty - they didn't have what I wanted.  What does this have to do with The Chickery?  Plain and simple - I don't want to have to look at the menu each time to confirm you still have my favourite menu items!  And the amount of times things have changed for no apparent reason since opening makes no sense to me.  Some things could be viewed as an improvement, but some things are making me crazy!

When the store first opened there was the option to have pop in a glass bottle.  After I got used to that, the coolers disappeared and were replaced with soda fountains.  Fine - I can see the financial reasoning behind this.  But then the menu items started changing too!  There used to be a time where you could get the chicken fingers with the option of one or two sides.  Now the chicken fingers only come with one side, and the price keeps inching higher and higher for less food.

50% of the time when I order the two-piece chicken, I somehow get a third piece.  Why am I complaining?  Because I ordered the two-piece chicken and now when I only get two pieces in the future I am going to be annoyed because sometimes you give me a third piece and now I don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth!

Sometimes I'll go in and just order two sides of mac and cheese.  At this point, I am convinced they go to the back and spin a wheel to decide how they will serve it to me.  Will it come in two small separate round containers?  Will there be a heaping portion in a clear salad container?  Will there be an average sized portion in a paper container?  I HAVE NO IDEA, CHICKERY!  Some days I bring my two servings of mac and cheese back to the office and am so full for the rest of the day I can hardly get my job done.  Other days, I started praying to the cake gods that somebody in the office has a birthday so I have something else to eat.

The sides are constantly changing too.  I don't know if this is still the case, but they used to change the options based on customer reaction.  I am all for taking the advice of your customer base, but this is starting to feel gimmicky.  I want to know what your menu sign printing budget is, because it honestly feels like I am looking at a completely different board every time I walk through the door.

Even the to-go bags have no idea what they want to be.  Will I get plastic?  Will I get paper?  Will I get paper with a super fancy stamp on it?  Will there be utensils and napkins?  NO IDEA!

The long and short of it is, I love the food at this place.  I really do.  It's delicious and filling and is the very definition of comfort food.  But I wish that it would figure out what it wants to be and stick with it!  It has so much to offer, and I know it can be a really great place once it gets into a good rhythm and sticks with it for awhile!",2

The women who participate in that class are old and crabby and will complain like no other about the swimmers getting ""their hair wet"" They don't accommodate the swimmers as told during sign up, meaning the aqua fit takes up most of the pool and doesn't leave behind 2 lanes for lap swimming like they're suppose to.

Anyways so we finally got our food after waiting about 35-40 minutes tops and the food tasted microwaved as chief Ramsey would say ""wowowow disgusting bloody hell"" so to say the only good experience from this would be the waiter, very nice gentleman whom always checked up on us and was doing his job correctly.

7141,3,1549152000000,"Great place to visit with family or friends. I worked with a woman at Toronto City Hall who would catch the bus down to the Ferry Terminal and spend her lunch hour on the Ferry. She did not have enough time to get off and walk around but felt the boat ride, looking out over the water helped make a bad day better. I am sure she is right.
My ex-husband worked for Toronto Police which hosted their annual summer picnics here. He would bring the kids allowing all to have a great time. The Police Association spared no expense for this event or the Christmas one held at the EX every year. For the summer picnic the kids had full access to rides at Centreville. They also hosted various races etc. where great prizes could be won. The picnic was catered serving the usual barbeque fare. 
The island also hosts a Natural Science School which is run by the Toronto District School Board. Students from the city can attend the Summer Camp programs which in my children's school time were free. Now the cost is $445.00 for the 5 day - 4 night program.
I have attended great boat races here but please protect yourself from the sun. One of the worst burns I have ever had was from watching a boat race here. 
For boaters this is a great place to sail or motor to being home to a few Marinas and Yacht Clubs. 
Looking for a great location for a wedding. There is a small church serving the Island Community surrounded by lovely gardens. 
I can't stress how great this place is for families. Children can be entertained in the Franklin Garden which has sculptures from the books or where they can learn to garden. 
Far Enough Farm has in residence horses, donkeys, cows, sheep, goats, pigs, rabbits, chickens, peacocks, geese and two emu.

Their policy with juices is also ridiculous. If you buy a large juice you have to buy their glass bottle. It's not a deposit. It's your bottle and you have the option to bring it back for a discount on future purchases. Well if you do, don't forget the cheap plastic lid, otherwise they will charge you again. Once I picked up the wrong bottle on my way which was the exact same size and design, just from another shop and they didn't honor the discount. So they are really just peddling these stupid bottles and not taking them back either. Not very sustainable. 
It's a popular place so a few times I have gotten attitude from the host/hostess when waiting for a seat.

As our sessions have continued I have been able to work through deeply stored trauma and wounding in a safe and nurturing environment, all facilitated through Cailin's skilled and well-honed healing approach.

Very tasty, tender, and moist with a good crunchy exterior. It was very good!

Sunrise:
Came with fried rice and a fried egg on top. The fried rice was a little too wet and sticky but had less and sweet potato and sausage in it. Was a little spicy because of some hot sauce they splash on the plate.

There seems to be a culture that deemphasizes business services.  

The food is at best adequate, and the atmosphere is, well, it's an Eat N Park.  One bright spot is the wait staff. They are friendly and accomodating, but given the limited resources they are provided by the Corporate moles, it does not make up for the shortsightedness towards the services a business traveler requires.  

The coffee cups are tiny, the food comes luke warm, and little value is given to attention to details in the food preparation.  

It is obvious that the target demographic is not the business traveler.  In looking around the restaurant, I would say that 90% of the patrons are over 60. 

If you like crappy food served with a smile, Eat N Park should work fine.  If you are a business traveler and expect a bit more, avoid all Eat N Parks like an Amway sales person.   For a truely accomodating meal for a business person, try Panera or Bob Evans.  They both offer WIFI and have far more ACcessible tables for the laptop carrier.  

Until Eat N Park is more accomodating to the business traveler,  I'll be eating elsewhere.",1
7250,3,1550707200000,"A long overdue review for a spectacular, truly exceptional show I've seen more than a dozen times already.

Simply put: Paul Vigil's hour long magic and mentalism show at the Mirage's King Ink is the best free show in Vegas, and probably the most uplifting, enchanting and thought-provoking shows in town - at any price.

For starters, forget everything you think you know about the magic of Blaine, Angel, Copperfield, etc. There are no large scale theatrical illusions like using quick edits, camera angles and mirrors to disappear the statue of liberty.

This is Paul sitting in a round parlor space, surrounded by audience members just a couple of feet away from his agile hands as they manipulate coins, cards and dice in ways that blow a hole in your expectations. It's as intimate as an evening sitting around the living room with your closest friends and family.

His narration is elegant and eloquent, peppered with references to the likes of T.S. Eliot, Bruce Lee and other poets and philosophers, and delivered with a gleam in his eye that lets you know that no matter how polished and well spoken his spiel is, Paul Vigil is clearly up to no good. And that's just how we like him!

Without spoiling the delight and surprise of his mind boggling compositions, effects that will haunt you after you leave and keep you awake at night wondering how the hell he did it, I can tell you that I've been watching Paul practice, perform and perfect some of these effects for five years, sitting right next to him, and couldn't venture the slightest guess how he pulls them off. It's no wonder he's the only magician to successfully fool Penn & Teller, whose blend of technical skill, creativity and devious misdirection make them and Paul spiritual kin of a sort.

I take almost all of my out of town visitors to see Paul, because his show is simultaneously an ""only in Vegas"" experience but at the same time is worlds removed from what people typically perceive as what a Vegas show can be.

And every single one of them still raves about his show, months and years later.

At one point, Paul describes one of his compositions warmly, saying that performing it ""restores (his) capacity for wonder."" And honestly, his whole show restores my own capacity for wonder.

And in a cynical, jaded world where mystery seems to be an endangered species, couldn't we all use a little more wonder and mystery in our lives?

See this show, it may be your most rewarding hour in Vegas.

Unless you hit the Megabucks. In that case, Paul's show would probably rank a close second.",2

7302,3,1550188800000,"Visited Buca Di Bepo for my sister's graduation dinner.  We had made a reservation well in advance for a party of 8.  

As soon as we were seated, the server came to us and said the only sauce we can serve you today is Marinara. Yes, Marinara! They were out of any Alfredo sauce.  I couldn't help but joke about how they didn't mention this before seating us.   (If I wanted a marinara sauce pasta - I would rather have it at home!).  About 15 mins later, he came out and had found that they had a secret stash of sauce which they would serve for one small dish - one small dish for 8 people.  We decided we had to compromise for another large dish w marinara sauce.  As soon as he served us dinner, we requested a Kids meal of Chicken Parmesan - only to find out that their kitchen had supposedly closed well before we got our meals - he somehow had forgotten to warn people about the kitchen closing soon.  That's when he said our only option for additional food would be House bread or desert, which we weren't served on being seated.  A few minutes into our meal, he stopped by to wrap things up.  An extremely disappointing experience, the only positive being the tiramisu, which is why we give it a single star than none.

We've love hosting large parties at this particular Buca but our experience at this graduation dinner was extremely disappointing; especially when they call themselves the Home of Graduation parties.  I would have to think before choosing this place for dinner.",1

Worst of all I ordered a nachos to go the other day and there were parts of a plastic bag in it! Yup went to take a bite and pulled a plastic bag out of my mouth.

La crevette venait accompagnée de legumes frits et était sûrement l'une des meilleures crevettes que j'ai eu la chance de manger. Ma copine a pris les pétoncles et c'était excellent. Pour le plat principal j'ai pris le filet mignon et ma copine le Fish'n'chips. Le filet mignon était excellent mais je dois avouer que le fish'n'chips avait l'air délicieux et qu'il goûtait aussi bon qu'il en avait l'air. À noter que les frites sont à volonté et que la serveuse viens vous les apporter directement à la table en vous les servant avec des pinces.

I took my 7 year old daughter to check it out a few months ago. And she had fun but from my point of view sky zone and even pump it up were more her speed. And the fact that there were so many little kids made me nervous that my 7 year old was gonna knock the little ones over or step on their fingers while climbing.

My partner and I were looking for a place near the Distillery District to eat because it was absolutely way too hectic to eat there this past weekend. 

It was a perfect short walk away! 

At first we were seated at this big long empty communal table because there were no other tables available, but the waitress must have sensed our discomfort and offered to move us to the main dining room once a table had cleared. That was great of her. 

We ordered: 
1) Piccante pizza: tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy sausage, chili flakes and red onions. 
This was so delicious. The centre bits were a little soggy but the rest of the crust was very tasty! It still makes my list of top 3 pizzas in the city. 

2) Amatriciana pasta: pancetta, red onions, parsley, pecorino shavings, tomato sauce, chili peppers, white wine. 
The first time the waitress brought this to us, it was very obviously undercooked. It was much more raw than ""al dente"". I tried taking a few bites but just couldn't eat it. Since the waitress came by to ask how it was, I told her and she immediately offered to take it back and bring out a better one in a few minutes. The 2nd one was much better!! Perfectly al dente I would say. The pancetta and pecorino went really well together. 

Overall, really great service. The waitress seemed to be one of only perhaps 2 other people serving the dining room, so we didn't mind at all waiting a bit in between things. The food came relatively fast, and it was only the bill that took awhile to get. But still! Really great Italian food, and I'd love to come back here again soon.",3

In our exhausted state, it was mesmerizing-- but upon reflection, it was a really cool view into how fresh their food really is. When we got everything back to the Airbnb, we dug in like starving wolves. The broccoli turned out to be covered in chili flakes, which was a bit too spicy for me, but everything else was delicious; perfect comfort food for a chilly rainy night when all you want to do is go to bed after.",1

The next day I call them, and Nicole, the nice lady who picks up says, ""Why does that name sound familiar?  OH!  We have that suspicious package that we never sent out that was supposed to be for you!""

They were both extremely helpful, cordial, and professional in reporting what happened, and their attention to detail and communication saw that the scammer never got the rifle scope they were going for.

-Bright windows facing Queen near Nathan Phillip Square make the tables nearby grand spots for people-watching. We knew right away where we wanted to be seated. The interior is adorably minimalist, using raw plank textures to conjure the idea of log cabins and rustic charm without resorting to deer heads and table saws (ahem Montana's). The touches are subtle. Birchbark-themed salt and pepper shakers, jarred preserves and chestnuts as decoration, no-nonsense simple white tables, warm wood touches here and there. Nice, and not too pretentious, though a step up from Canteen where the servers are clad in blue plaid. Great for dates or for a nice conversation-starter sort of dinner with pals.

The food:
-First off, I mixed up 'bannock' with 'pemmican'. I was hoping that the Canadian cuisine on offer might hat-tip to some First Nation influence - but it was not to be. A little sad about that, but that's the academic in me. The food here is richly steeped in our history as settlers (colonizers yes, all of the above) and offers creative twists on blue-collar staples from pea soup, chili, mac and cheese, poutine and neat gamey meats.

-We ordered the bread basket appetizer, because if I was going to Bannock I was darn well going to eat some. The server informed me their bakery was upstairs and it tasted like it. The bannock was a cross between roti and a soft taco, dense and delicious. The artisan breads were unbuttered and fresh, served with a simple red pepper hummus.

-We ordered the pineapple sangria because the people next to us did. It looked so fresh and summery we couldn't resist. It was fresh and cold. At first blush it tasted like juice but the wine taste followed, nice and smooth. It was gone too fast, despite the large wineglass serving size.

-I ordered the pork shoulder ($18) recommended by our server, because frankly I found the menu options slightly difficult to visualize. Pickles? Goat cheese feta? Toasted taro sticks? What would that salad look like? No idea. Good thing too because it was fantastic - melt in your mouth tender with amazing carmelized onions and apples on top, resting on a small bed of onion-infused bannock pieces. Slightly sweet with a faint spice. 

The portion was larger than my normal meat intake but you bet I ate all of it and was sad when it was gone. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys pulled pork sandwiches, or any carnivores who don't want steak. My only wish would be to have some steamed veggies on the side - come on people, some other food group besides meat would have been nice.

-My after-dinner cappuccino was $4 and was not as large as I would have hoped, but it was still delicious and completely necessary to wash down all that tasty pork.

-The girls next to us were having a great time with a steaming plate of poutine bannock pizza, which, despite being a heart-clogger, smelled fantastic. They ordered it because the people next to *them* ordered it, and if we weren't so full we probably would have too. 

The service:
-Our server was cheerful and genuine and very attentive. She had great recommendations on the menu and made us feel quite at home.

Convenience: 
-Extremely close (2 minutes max!) to the Eaton Centre and Queen subway stop, so even the directionally challenged will be able to find it.

Overall, I'd go again sometime, because the menu is interesting, the food and service were both very good, and because any place that serves fancy 'Canadian comfort food' is bound to start a conversation.",2

I tried the chocolate bacon treat due to my family's unwillingness to try it themselves.  My aunt was disgusted.  I thought it was decent.  The staff was very friendly and was very willing to let us sample other chocolates, which I liked, as some of the higher end places like this look down upon the people that just come in to browse.

The bar was already out of Stella & Miller Light on tap...boo. To our surprise, we hadn't finished our first beer before being seated. Cool! After we were seated not one person came to the table for 25 mins (but several walked by) - we let 2 servers know & waited nearly another 10 mins until our neighboring table told their server, Chris T., we had not yet been helped. Chris stopped over immediately, apologized, and just took our table. We ordered an appetizer, it came out pretty quick then the manager stopped to tell us it was on them due to our delayed service. Nice! We ordered our deep dish pizza and were told it would take about 45 mins. We eventually got our pizza (a significant wait taking the whole time into account) but it was very good, maybe a 8.5 or 9/10. We also ordered the cannoli, it was eh. Ultimately Chris did a great job picking up the slack. Also to our surprise they covered the cost of our pizza. Totally unexpected - we really didn't complain! We made sure to tip Chris based off what the cost should've been. The 4 stars is for Chris' hard work, the pizza,  the space is nicely decorated & they did the right thing knowing we had an extended wait for really no reason.",2

I personally think the cupcakes need to be maybe 25% bigger??? w/ the frosting all the way around the cake it doesn't necessarily have to be as high as it is but the frosting should be covering all the cake, Looks pretty skimpy as is although I'm all about the frosting! The execution was very pretty I absolutely loved the actual vanilla bean inside the interior pastry cream well thought out combination.

The portions are significant and everyone enjoyed their meals. I had the California Benedict and will likely be enjoying my food coma the rest of the day. The coffee was strong and consistent, which is just now we like it.

7523,2,1551052800000,"Been dying to try this place with all the hype around it, to be frank its mostly hype, location and ambiance. 

The few times I tried to just walk in they never had a table available. For a table of 2 the online reservation system only had an early seating available. But when we arrived the restaurant didn't feel packed the whole night. The decor was very nice, dark and perfect for a romantic date. The ceilings were high and the beautiful woven wall piece.

We got the grilled octopus, it wasnt chewy but also didn't feel very flavourful, on the bland side. The serving was also quite small 7 tiny pieces with small cut potatoes. Also tried the piquillo peppers stuffed with oxtail and manchego, the ox tail was braised and was very soft, I wish there was more cheese, but again for $17 there were only 2 small peppers and felt overpriced. 

The paella was good, and came out nice and hot. It was filled with shrimp, mussels, calamari  snap peas and clams. It was nicely seasoned, and rice was perfectly cooked. The portions are a good and large size!

For dessert we got the fried milk, the milk itself was ok deep fried gelatiny milky blocks, not the best I've ever had. The saffron ice cream however was delicious, and was presented beautifully with edible flowers. We left very full at the end of the night. 

The service was good, my glass always had water and they were very friendly. We were never rushed, we were there for probably a little more than 2 hours. The hostesses were dressed very trendy might I add.",2

7536,1,1549324800000,"Roy's Liquor Store is a friendly, classy establishment on the corner of Hualapai/Desert Inn in south Summerlin. They offer a wide selection that includes craft beers, fine wine, premium sake, Don Pilar tequila, and high quality cigars. Roy is easy-going and knowledgeable.

The store is right next to Rachel's Kitchen, a gourmet café I love. I started dropping in whenever I needed a bottle of wine or sake. Along with the diverse selection, I noticed the cigar room, and though I'm not a cigar connoisseur, it looked too swank not to step into. The room is walled with cedar and equipped with humidifier to age and protect the cigars; there are hundreds to choose from; stacked high above the cigars are international-looking wood boxes. It smells fantastic, like you've stepped into a giant cedar cabinet. I imagined the ""Most Interesting Man in the World"" lighting a cigar and saying, ""I don't always smoke cigars, but when I do, I prefer Roy's.""

There's more. Twice when I've dropped in he's had interesting, live tastings. First it was for Zing Vodka. The ""Red Velvet"" sample went down so smooth I bought two bottles. Having two gorgeous women selling it may have helped its case. The Zing bottles and glasses light up, too, creating their own festivity and allure as you drink. My friends enjoyed the Zing as well-the flavored version was easy to drink by itself, at room temperature.

Then last Friday evening it was Don Pilar Tequila. Honestly I've never acquired a taste for tequila-until that moment. Even before drinking I noticed its golden, bright hue; then I could smell notes of toasty oak, fruit, and butterscotch. It tasted just like it smelled, plus a touch of pineapple, chocolate, and baked agave, then a warm slow finish of sweet oak. Suddenly I felt like the most interesting man in the world.

Nick Christie, who was helping with the tasting and manages the Don Pilar brand for Las Vegas, told me Roy's would be the only place in Las Vegas one could purchase Don Pilar Tequila.  http://www.donpilar.com/

If all this wasn't enough, Roy takes pride in his work and store. The store is always well-stocked, clean, nicely lit, and Roy greets you with a smile. These are the places I prefer to take my business. I also appreciate what he had printed on the back of his business card:  Please Drink Responsibly. Don't Drink and Drive.

7541,1,1551225600000,"What fun! The first time I went here was in 2007 for Nuite Blanche (which was an interesting and cool yet kind of weird party) but it was still under construction. 

In 2011, I had the opportunity to check it out three times and even get a private tour for some research I was working on. 

VIBE 
Woodsy. That outer-rim area outside but inside the gallery is one of the coolest and most peaceful places in this city. Amazing. 
The staff know their stuff. 

THE GOODS 
There is an extensive Canadian collection here including many of the works of famed art group, The Group of Seven. This is what I toured mainly and it's fantastic. I've also hung out in the store quite a bit for a few parties and they have some really cool books and goods that are perfect for gifts. Don't discount this store when you're Christmas shopping! 

There's a private members area for lunches. If you can get in here, you're golden. 

In the summer, if you're lucky to stumble upon it the AGO has a little sale and sells pencil cases and notebooks for about $1-$3. Not sure if it gets on their mailing list but maybe worth remembering. I was lucky to get a few Monet laden items that made fantastic stocking stuffers at Christmas. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Frank Ghery's construction really reinvigorated the AGO and the downtown core. It's definitely brought me back. The AGO is doing fantastic things from getting involved with Groupon to having tweetups during Nuit Blanche and more. If I had the money, I'd love to join their NEXT community. Bravo!",2

The charcoal used in combination with the gas grill adds such a great smoky flavor to the meat also! Everything we had had SO much flavor, many items were a bit spicy, which we love, but others may want to be cautious. Our server BB was an amazing cook and super attentive to us.

When our waitress asked for our drink order, we both requested water. She obviously was not  pleased. Some time later she asked if we got our water, and we said no. So she got one of the young men to bring it to us.  She came back to take our order, and was not impressed that we did not order high priced items. My husband wanted the soup and salad, and I asked for soup and fettucine  alfredo.  She asked if she should bring his salad with my soup, and his soup with my entree. We said yes. 
My soup came and it was barely lukewarm. My husband got his salad. I sent my soup back to heat up. As soon as it came back and I took 3 sips - my entree arrived! By the time I finished my soup and started on my entree it was no longer hot, but I kept eating. My husband didn't get his soup until I was half done.

The food and service here are very good. I typically opt for the veggie plate (delicious mac and cheese and greens), but I'm also a fan of the white-meat fried chicken, and I have a friend who swears by the pot roast. The deserts are definitely a weak spot--the banana pudding tastes instant and the chess pie wasn't very good either.  But you go here for the entrees, not the deserts, so that's forgivable.

As many have noted, the restaurant has a positive social message, which makes it easier to tolerate the high prices for what is, in essence, extremely cheap Southern soul food (I grew up on these delicious artery-clogging recipes, so I feel that I can say this with some authority).  This type of food is neither difficult nor expensive to make. But, since I'm not making it at home and this place does a good job of it, I'll have to put myself down as a fan.

I made a reservation a week in advance for my wife and I to celebrate her birthday.  We arrived exactly 9 minutes late.  The 2 hostesses were caught up in a conversation with a guy I had to interupt their personal/flirtatious conversation.  They said oh your table is almost ready.  After waiting 8 more minutes we asked to speak with the manager.  While he was speaking to us the 2 snobby unprofessional hostesses decided to put in another time stating we were over 15 minutes late therefore, cancelling our reservation.

My family including myself will never step foot in this establishment.  Management you have a real issue of integrity up at the front of the house, which should be addressed immediately.  If you have any doubt when my wife and I arrived for our 730 reservation on Saturday, May 19th please check your security cameras to verify what time we arrived.",3

7646,1,1549584000000,"I really wanted to share my poor experience here today at 12:45pm.  My family was next door finished our sushi lunch and our eyes were drawn to this coffee place.  We went inside and there were two staff not a hello greeting or acknowledgement.  The store was quite empty with just a table of two. 

My bad experience stems from the staff that served my husband and I.  She just gave us blank stares and not even asked what we wanted standing in front of us while we stood there waiting to be served.  I opened my mouth and asked for 2 medium coffees.  She rang our order and then turned behind to get the coffees.  Came back 3 seconds later informing us that they were out of medium roast and if we were ok with dark roast.  A coffee place that didn't have medium roast on a Sunday at prime time? 

She gave us this attitude and facial expression that I can tell she didn't give a care about working there and customers.  My husband proceeded to get the dark roast alternative while I excused myself of it.  When she returned my change she just threw it in my hand with attitude and I said thanks but she just swiftly turned away. 

To the owner: I hope you take this review seriously and retrain your staff because a small business definitely requires good products as well equally important its customer service and this was such a poor experience that was enough to have us never return.",2

They're fast and productive, and welcome everyone in. My favorite stylist is definitely Shelby. I asked her to do my hair one way, and she does it perfect. Every single time.
She's definitely the most friendly in my opinion, and she will go to any length to make sure you walk out satisfied.

The rest of the stylists are nice and easy also. They manage very well under pressure, and work as a team. When Shelby isn't in, I don't have a problem going to the others.

It wasn't where I expected to find it; sandwiched between a TJ Maxx and a Marshalls, but it lived up to the reviews.  Got there around 7:30 and told there was a twenty to thirty minute wait which was fine with me because I can always shop, but we were seated within ten minutes.  No one was super starving, so we skipped on appetizers.  Solid beer selection which pleased our group.  They also have alcoholic milkshakes.  One person ordered the granddad.  Holy booze - this shake was delicious, but there big and strong so be careful!!

BURGERs:  You can choose from organic, free range beef, bison, chicken breast or a veggie burger for all of the burgers.  I don't eat a lot of red meat, so when I go all in when I get a burger!  Two of us got the Monty; peppercorn rub, horseradish cheese with a Cabernet sauce and onions... SO GOOD.  Ordered medium rare and they were perfect.  Other side of the table did the custom burgers and they were extremely happy as well.  Burgers come with homemade potato chips, but you can also substitute fries and coleslaw too.  Chips were great, and the fries were good too (they had some kind of rosemary seasoning).  By the end of dinner, everyone's plate was empty.  Service was great too!

Bottom line: Check it out.",2

My friend and I both got the BLTC and we were both disappointed. The presentation is nice but the taste was not. First, they failed to mention the bread was full of whole peppercorns. It was way too strong eating multiple whole peppercorns in each bite. It completely overpowered the taste. Secondly, I LOVE Gorgonzola but they put way too much on the sandwich making it way too salty. The Tu Bock Shakur was great. Patio setting was awesome. Service was not so great. I will be back for the beer and hopefully the next menu item I try won't be as extremely disappointing.",2

The nurse I had was super sweet and made sure to write down all of my concerns. Checking in was a breeze when I printed my paperwork at home and walked in and handed them everything.

A few of my favorite things are the scallops, ceviche, salt and pepper frites, and the punch love drunk cocktail! 

The octopus ceviche is full of flavor and had a very clean and refreshing taste. The scallops dish was presented with a layer of chorizo on the bottom and a quail egg on top, a very interesting but wonderful addition to the scallop itself!  The salt and pepper frites were the best French fries you'll ever have. The fries were perfectly crispy and topped with a garlic aoli sauce ($10) 

Aside from the food, I also loved the ambiance. It is very chic and trendy!

7718,2,1548979200000,"This review comes from the point of view of a visitor to the city, a person coming from a large metro area with transit areas managed by multiple agencies (versus a single city agency as Calgary Transit). From the several days I spent in Calgary, experiencing the service so many depend on including my local friend, I feel that many other transit agencies near and far can learn from what Calgary Transit has cultivated, and how it handles aspects of its present situation. Most importantly, I noticed the density of ridership (even with the high numbers of riders using the service primarily for Stampede); somehow, the agencies back home in my neck of the woods (SF Bay Area) might somehow figure out how to concentrate this sort of ridership, whether through strategic planning for further route development or creating further incentives for riders through such features as frequency of service (nearly four and half stars in my book for Calgary Transit, in this vein), among others. I was surprised how quickly I could make it to and from downtown to my friend's more suburban neighborhood in the southwestern quadrant of the city. I was rather surprised how quiet Calgary commuters are compared to other portions of the SF Bay Area transit agencies I have used. Sure, the C-Train's not as comfy as SF BART is; however, the frequency of service does make up for that.  I'm glad for such a transit system that made a visit with my friend much easier and less worrisome.",2

Couldn't help but see the manager coming towards our table as she seemed quite on a mission.  It was no surprise, as she braced herself against the back of my seat in the booth, and quipped....""I understand you can't find what you want on our menu"".   Harsh...very harsh.   I explained what I wanted.  She said they couldn't do it.  Appalled at the Manager-with-an-attitude who is definitely in the wrong job....rude, abrupt.  I had no other choice as she towered over waiting for me to make a selection, to order the ground beef and cheese burrito which was lightly fried.  When my dinner arrived at the table, it was a pathetic 4"" by 4"" heavily fried 1/2"" thick (flat) something with MAYBE two tablespoons of ground beef in it.

I asked for music.....imagine laying there for an hour.....no music, just dead silence and the grunting of the therapist. I was the last massage of the day, and no music. I was not as nice of an experience as the music is what relaxes you. I asked several times for music and the guy just literally laughed at me. Other than that, great massage at a great price.

I often find Vegas restaurants overpriced.  This restaurant, tends to be on the pricey side too but if you know where to get the coupon, it can be one of the best hidden secret on Las Vegas Blvd, and they open 24 hours (However, coupon only works from 4pm to midnight daily).

I tried many of their dishes, from breakfast items, famous Reuben Sandwiches with Marble Bread (Yummy), Grilled Ribeye steak, Fried Honey Chicken...All of them exceeded my expectation.  

The Best food here, however is their Chinese food. I always came dinner/midnight hours so your experience may varied.  Their Asian (Chinese) food are AWESOME.  I came from LA, which is known to have tons Asian/Chinese restaurants.  This place, oh man, beats 90% of the restaurants in LA area.  Its SO GOOD.

I realized right away that it would be difficult to complete the deal as they get booked up 3 weeks in advance, and the deal expires 6 months after it was purchased. The biggest issue is that they have VERY limited appointments available after 4pm. Most women work for a living and don't even get off work before this time. How can you expect to satisfy the public if you aren't even available when the majority of people are off work??
I must say the pedicure experience itself was amazing. The owner did my service and she is the nicest woman and she did great. She explained to me everything that was going on and we chatted for the entire 2 hour experience. Even better is how clean they are and they use plastic inside the basin so you are never using the same tub as someone else. 
I had to cancel my second appointment the day of because something came up so unfortunately I lost one of my visits- fair enough it does say that in the voucher. However I really wanted to reschedule for as soon as possible. Next available appointment- a FULL 3 WEEKS LATER. Seriously?! Keep the $70.

7809,2,1549065600000,"I've been curious about ramen in MTL but never seem to get around to trying any whenever I visit. It was freezing the other day and I wanted something soupy. I thought of Korean but wasn't sure if there is any good Korean food in MTL so I decided on Imadake, across the street from Alexis-Nihon.

I was in a bit of a rush so we didn't have time to drink and draw out the meal beyond the time it took us to eat, so we didn't get to try any of their cocktails or other drinks, but they had a number of items on their fairly extensive menu that I would not have minded (their online menu is slightly different). I was also glad to see black cod present but I didn't end up ordering it as I hadn't yet tried anything at Imadake and if the fish wasn't done right, I would have been really disappointed! There were the usual izakaya staples: salads, grilled skewers of meat/skin/cartilage, gyoza, takoyaki, okonomiyaki & other fried items, dessert, etc. but what we really wanted was ramen.

Imadake offers about 4-5? choices of ramen where you choose the broth type: miso or ""original"", which I don't know if that's shoyu (soy sauce) or shio (salt) but there was no mention of tonkotsu anywhere on the menu; and then you select flavours: miso with pork belly (~$11) and miso grilled garlic ($12?) ramens were what we ordered, along with grilled mackerel (~$10), and then I watched the guys behind the counter throwing it all together. There was one working on the presentation of dishes that were done before ours and really getting into the placing of the garnishes, all intense-looking.

The mackerel came out as two pieces and was grilled nicely, with the edges all crispy. Not overly flavourful but definitely didn't have the fishy taste that mackerel often comes with. I didn't try the grilled garlic ramen but my miso pork belly was just OK. There were no sprouts in sight, nor anything with crunch, which there should have been. The pork belly was too thin and small (only one piece; I wonder how much you get with the ""extra pork belly order"" for $2 more?), and we both agreed that the broth wasn't terribly flavourful. The noodles were springy but very slightly undercooked. The egg wasn't soft boiled and runny, which is good because I don't like them that way anyhow, even though that's how it's supposed to be done. I wasn't sure if the place is Japanese or Chinese-owned so I had no idea what I'd get when I asked for ""something hot"" to add to our ramens to liven up the broth. We got those chili pepper flakes in oil that you get in Chinese restos, which did the job. 

I don't think anyone who works there is over the age of 25, and they all seemed professional. There are a lot of staff which is probably quite useful as I could see Imadake being busy most nights. Service was great, very friendly and attentive, among them a couple of actual Japanese waitresses! 

I haven't been to other ramen-ya or izakayas in Montreal but the ones in Toronto have been mostly mediocre at best with few exceptions. I don't know what the MTL standard for these types of places is but I would go back to Imadake to try other items. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but based on this one time, I'd bump this place up by another half *.",2

They said to work it out with the owners. Unfortunately the owners rent their units and are unresponsive. It is clearly an HOA issue and the community manager, Tom Gordon, will not even give me the courtesy of at phone call. He is hiding behind the answering service whom has hung up on me 3 times rather than come up with an appropriate after-hours solution to an unidentified water leak amongst at least 4 units.

I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and organization of the store and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. I have come back a few times since, and have always had the same positive experience.

Then Larry, our check in guy, said ok well if you don't want an upgrade we only have a 2 queen room available.  I said we reserved a king Larry replied no you requested a king and we only have king junior suites available ... After going a few rounds Larry goes to speak to his ""supervisor"" and miraculously he came back and said they did have a king available.

Again if ur just into having a bed this may work...but the hotel is just not up to par with technology or customer service.

June 2013 Update:  Now that I've been about 15 times and had more tacos (still excellent) but other things too I thought I'd say a little more.  The burrito is also very good.  Go on Tuesdays for cheaper tacos, and Wednesdays for cheaper burritos.  There are a few very good beers on tap including my favourite, Flying Monkeys IPA.

It wasn't very crowded at lunch so we were able to be started right away. There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu, but we decided to go with the Adam Bomb burger and the True Southerner sandwich. They were both delicious. The burger was actually cooked medium rare how I ordered it which almost never happens. The True Southerner was very filling and a great combination. The fried were delicious and the Mac and cheese was pretty good too. You could tell they really care about the quality of the ingredients. 

We decided to all split the banana pudding, peach berry cobbler, and butterscotch bread pudding for dessert. I thought the bread pudding was dry and was disappointed by it. The other two were amazing though. The banana pudding was probably the best I've had.

While I have had some awesome burgers at other restaurants around the city that don't necessarily specialize in burgers (Tessaro's in Bloomfield, Remedy in Lawrenceville, and Six Penn in the Cultural District- try them all!), Winghart's is definitely the winner among those that claim fame in burger making.

My boyfriend and I came to the South Side location after a botched attempt to go to the Market Square one which is currently under renovations and I am so happy we made the extra little jaunt to the South Side instead of letting our hungry stomachs take us astray somewhere else downtown.

I tried the Shipwreck burger after reading many of the previous reviews on here and it did not disappoint! Gooey brie all mixed up with caramelized onions, bacon, arugula, and white truffle aioli (hooray for fancy mayo!) to compliment a GIANT beef patty on the perfect bun.  I was honestly so preoccupied with my own massive feast that I don't remember what exactly my boyfriend got but i tried a bite of it and it was cheesy, delicious, and spicy.  

Pro's: 
- Awesome creative burger combinations served in a plastic wrapper to keep it all from becoming a giant mess while you eat it
- Great fries to boot (a necessary combo with any burger)
- Great draft and liquor selection
- Friendly staff

Con's:
- Place was not crowded and took a LONG time for our food to come out
- Ordered my burger medium and it came out well-done (saved because it was still juicy, but I like my cows still mooing! Will have to remember to opt for medium rare next time)

Literally its like Eureka several nights a month for me. Hands down the closest thing I have found to a NYC Style slice of pizza.

They have 4 or 5 variety's of small Italian dinners for under $5.50. I often grab the lasagna with tomato sauce ( which comes with garlicky bread), but the mancotti, stuffed shells and meatballs are all delicious. 

This little joint is a hidden gem... it usually has at least half of the tables filled and a bubbly personality at the counter to help with orders.

What wasn't expected was when we got the bill, he was charged $18.00 for his $9.00 beer.  We asked about it and the waiter told us the beer is $9.00 and the ""commemorative"" Cabo Wabo glass was an additional $9.00.  WTF!  $18.00 bucks for a 22oz beer?  Needless to say the $9.00 surcharge was reflected in the waiters tip, since he didn't warn us about that.

The reason for the 4 star reduction is because of napkins and 3 stars because of the really crappy engineered drive through. Its the thinnest drive thru we have ever driven through. we made a wide right hand turn from the pick up window and still scraped our rim. Ok so I thought maybe we are just somewhat retarded and decided to eat our food in the car and watch other cars and how they navigate what I felt was crappy design. It took us 15 minutes to eat our food and in that time frame we counted 22 cars, 14 of them being Suvs out of the 14 suvs 9 of them hit the curb or ran over it. The other 8 vehicles 3 hit the curb.

(Ha chef I know what craziness of pasta station.  I'm preety sure you got a little taste of it at Babbo)  Pasta should be SIMPLE, period!   And pasta bar showed what simplicity of pasta was.  Good pasta and little sauce. 

As an appetizer I ordered the caprese salad and the flavors I would say was delicious to my pallet.  The intensity of the basil pesto was perfect and buffalo mozzarella melted in your mouth.  The heirloom tomato was a little under ripped but what can you do?  Appetizer = A+

Now the main course, PASTA!  I ordered the fennel pasta (not sure what it is called but lets call it the fennel pasta) and I thought it was a bit strange.  Pasta and fennel?  To tell you the truth this dish was okay.  I thought the flavors didn't really complemented each other and the pasta was a little on the thick side.  But on the other side it was a unique idea.

It's the bomb! So I went there and order one along with black mussels. The place was really crowded on Friday nights and there's a lot of people having birthdays so we got waiters and waitress singing and clapping for birthdays songs the whole night. The free appetizer comes, bread with olive oil and vinegars. I tried to ask for butter but my waiter was kinda forgetting my request cause the poor waiter had to take order and sing the birthday songs in three tables. And finally the black mussels was arrived and its totally become my favorite food of the day. The sweetness and freshness of the mussels along with white wine, garlic and butter just gave the superb flavor away. I immediately felt in love with this food. Finally after the appetizer was gone and the black mussels too we waited again for 20 minutes until our spaghetti is coming and we already full cause of the long waiting and the appetizer.

This evening was put aside to share with friends and have a nice relaxing dining experience. This was not a memorable experience at all. First of all for all of us to decide on a restaurant with such high prices and great location you would think the meal would be outstanding at all. Our reservation was at 8 . we arrived on time and the restaurant was empty. About 5 tables were full. The decor nice facing the aria fountains. The music a bit loud. Well we started with a cocktail order from Paul. Nice guy friendly funny. Our drinks after flagging down someone came  to the table 40 minutes later with an apology 2 to 3 times. We ordered our meal and the food was OK. My halibut was awful. Crusted halibut as dry can be. Awful taste first bite. I had my boyfriend try it as well. It took some time before we could flag down our waiter Paul again. He seemed very flustered when I told him. Paul put another order in. The second order was worse than the first.raw and a pile of salt thrown on.this time the dish arrived wen my friends were already finished with their meal.then we were told a special desert was coming out. I had told our waiter it was my boyfriends birthday.ok now no surprise. The deserts looked amazing with no candle. I mentioned please bring a candle after the deserts arrived. Paul went back and said oh right oh right. He returned with 2 candles on a plate burning was like what the heck! The candles weren't even put into the desert! this experience was a joke but not a joke on our pocket book. After 300 dollars later .,2

Got my two dogs washed, dried and they were so happy.

I was satisfied with their service and the great deal I got for the Toyota Celica.",2
8086,2,1549497600000,"So my first experience was on opening night for this location and it was alright.  It was pretty packed, and loud, so I think I didn't talk loud enough when I placed my order and I wound up missing the lettuce and tomato on my burger.  Their bacon comes extra crispy and didn't seem like anything special.  Overall the burger was pretty decent, however I thought it'd be much better the way I ordered it and sans bacon as I'm not a crispy bacon fan.  Also I ordered the regular fries, their smallest size, and it's still a huge amount.  They fill the cup that the fries come in, then upon putting that and the burger in the bag, they dump another scoop of fries on top of the whole thing which could potentially make your burger wrapper very greasy if you were getting it to go.

On my second visit, it was much slower and my order came exactly as I ordered it with all the condiments.  This time without bacon and the addition of lettuce and tomato, it was quite an enjoyable burger.  I ordered the regular Five Guys fries this time and while still being too much to eat, they were tasty.

All in all for a pretty big burger, fries and a drink, you're looking at 10 bucks.

A couple things to note here are the amount of things you can put on the burger.  It's quite a decent selection.  Also there are boxes of peanuts with trays at the end of the checkout line that they offer for free to snack on while you eat.  Finally, they have Mello Yellow on the fountain here which may be enough to sway your descision in and of itself.  The establishment itself is quite clean and well laid out.",2

As we were driving down the street, I noticed this donut shop out of the corner of my eye.  I made a mental note and decided that I would look them up later.  When I checked them out on Yelp, I noticed that they had few, (although positive) ratings and even fewer photos.  I also noticed that their hours were from 4 am until 9 pm.  Is that a typo? Those are some very generous hours and they left me intrigued.  I decide that before we head out of town, we should try these donuts.  Knowing that I might get into a little trouble, I also decide to mitigate damages before anything even happens.  That way, I can walk in guilt-free and order whatever I want.  Yes!!  I prepare a couple of smoothies made from fresh turnip greens, nectarines, banana and blueberries that we finish enroute..  Now I'm ready!

The bakery is a very simple building that seems to have been there for years.  It was one a Dunkin Donuts.  Ewww!     As we enter, I notice that the bakery is divided into two sections, (eat in and take out).  The eat in counter is for those who want to have one of their breakfast sandwiches while take out is for those just picking up donuts.  We proceed to order a variety of treats such as chocolate and traditional donuts, donut holes, and an almond pastry. I ask if she has anything close to a cake donut and the glazed cruller is suggested.  After returning to the car, we try the donuts.  OMG!  The donut holes are very light and airy and just seem to collapse as they touch my mouth.  I found myself popping them in like raisins.  Thank goodness I only purchased half of a dozen! 

 I then move on to the Cruller which I can only describe as a thing of beauty!  Cake donuts are my favorite so this was my everything.  It was so good that I exited the car and purchased another one, (for later)!  In the mean time, we decided that we do not need breakfast because these ""old school"" donuts are quite substantial compared to the chain varieties.  You will only need to eat a couple before feeling very satisfied. 

 My husband and I both agree that these are some of the best donuts we have ever tasted.  They are just a quality product, perfectly executed and definitely worth a visit.  We actually went out of our way to the opposite side of town for these donuts and it was absolutely a great decision.  Two thumbs up!  Whoop!  Whoop!

U can choose ur own ingredients by taking a flavoured powdeeed injection or a test tube and then mix in ur fav sweeter and ur choice of diary. Even though it was fun making my own drink I feel it was highly expensive for a casual bubble tea place. I know places that sell bubble tea for just 4$.

I loved the room with the mirrors....fun place to take pictures.  The dark room was creepy but interesting.  If no one is there, go ahead and sing and listen to the echo :)  Go with an open mind and a willingness to find fun in the most unusual settings.

I finally got there, they had an etch a sketch for my 2 year old son to play with, and we ordered the bacon (excellent), the fries with gravy (very good), the hash browns (awesome!), an onion soup (tasted like it was made today, fantastic), and the caesar salad and strawberry fields salad with chicken. The Caesar was good, maybe not great. The Strawberry Fields salad was amazing, the arugula, the strawberries, the balsamic dressing! Magnifique!

Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.

My mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN!  Yowzer!  Artery clogger for sure.

That stuff is pure oil, and to me it also  makes the food seem slimy  I and my whole family and friends are boycotting every fast food place that is now using this to cut cost.

They have plenty of great beers on tap, daily specials, homemade desserts, and fantastic servers. Vegetarian and family friendly (to an extent) they likely will have something for everyone.

The one time we visited it was around dinner time and the store had absolutely no ingredients. They had no pasta, no breads, the pastries were old. We left and didn't order anything. 

The next time I came in they messed up the order and served the sandwiches on the wrong bread. 

Today we came in at 2 for lunch. Me and my friend ordered the pick two and our other friend ordered a full panini. My friends had modified their breads.

We waited another 5-10 minutes for our friends full panini (which was the same as my other friends pick 2 sandwich.... So why did it take so long?) when the waitress came with the full panini we let her know that the breads were incorrect and she informed us that they had run out of the ones we requested. What?!

8141,2,1550448000000,"My last night in Pittsburgh for work and I had to end the trip with an awesome dinner with an old high school friend. I was perusing Yelp, spouting out names and I came across this place. My friend said, ""Dude, if you can get us a reservation at täkō THAT'S where we're going"". He must not know who I am. (Puts sunglasses on.) Needless to say, I got us a reservation after failing to online, but by calling and we went. First of all, the kitchen is at the FRONT of the restaurant because you can actually sit at a stool right outside and order food directly from the kitchen. Legit. Inside the atmosphere is almost.. ""goth-like"". its very dark, red lighting everywhere, decorative ""splatter"" on the walls, but it was certainly unique. It wasn't too packed so we were sat downstairs. The staff was very friendly, flirty and helpful to me being a first-timer. Their menus were like... newspapers which I thought was pretty cool. I had already been drinking and was feelin' spend-y (bad idea) so I started with drinks! I began with their Thai Coconut margarita which was sweet and delicious. It didn't taste very strong, but take note of that. For an appetizer we got the Thrice Cooked Wings which are covered in a caramel fish sauce all over pickled carrots, cucumber, mint chili seasoning and cilantro. I know that sounds like a wild combination, but DON'T KNOCK IT. Some of THE BEST fall-off-the-bone, like, how-did-you-make-them-taste-this-good wings I've ever had. They were hot, spicy, sweet, savory... I can't use enough adjectives. JUST KNOW, they were that good. I made the mistake of eating the chili peppers... more than twice so my mouth was on fire. For our entrees we got 6 tacos and split them so we could have 1 each of 3 different kinds. The tacos come in pairs. Seemingly expensive, but ultimately worth it. We went for the Chorizo, Carnitas and the Bistec. The Chroizo comes with carmelized onions, roasted poblano, romesco, gently fried egg, queso fresco, arbol hot sauce and cilantro. We received an anonymous tip from a table next to us to flip the egg upside down so that when you bite into the taco the egg yolk runs into the taco. OMG. Mind blown. AMAZING. I'm not even going to try describing the flavor to you. Just get it. Next was the Carnitas which comes with braised pork butt, guacamole, salsa verde, chicharrones and cilantro. Again, very good. Not as good as the Chorizo, but I have NO complaints. Lastly, the Bistec comes with wagyu skirt steak, salsa roja, gem lettuce, queso fresco, fried shishito and of course cilantro. This was my favorite of the 3. It just blew me away. The flavor combinations that the chefs were able to concoct just blow my mind. For my 2nd drink I had the Watermelon Basil margarita which was very tasty, but again, weak. I will absolutely return here to try the rest of the menu. I was extremely impressed with the food, just not with the drinks. No matter, it'll save me more money and room in my stomach for my tacos by not getting drinks.",2

The hostess seemed stressed out and clearly did not want to help us lol. She asked us if we wanted a table or large booth so we just chose the booth because it was offered. When we sat down it was clear she was annoyed that we chose the larger booth. She tossed us our menus and told us our server would be right with us. Our server Jenevieve also seemed stressed out and we felt very un welcomed. While ordering she would cut us off and wouldn't let us finish the name of the entree/'appetizer we were getting, which was rude. When she brought the bread and oil&vinegar, she placed our plate of oil as far away from us as possible, behind the table tent that was on our table. (I can't make this stuff up). Anyway, our food came out in a timely manner, however it wasn't until I mentioned we would be having dessert for his birthday, that she turned her attitude around. She suddenly put a smile on her face, (which I'm guessing was because us ordering dessert was the cherry on top of her tab), and was so cheery and pleasant.

There is really two stories when it comes to my experience.

The food-  This is where I would give this place 2 or maybe even 1 star.  I love shepherds pie and it was of course on the menu, so I ordered it.  It was a somewhat decent portion and looked good.  However, the goodness ended there.  When I laid my fork into it I discovered that this was not a shepherds pie.  What I was served was a liquid soup like substance.  I couldn't even eat it with a fork so I had to request a spoon, which was an adventure.  I had to wait 10 minutes before I could get someones attention to bring me a spoon. 

The drinks- They have a decent beer selection, but I wouldn't go back for that.  What I would go back is for their mixed drinks.  They have a nice drink selection and do a great job making them.  They take their time and make them right with some semi-advanced techniques.  Although the bartenders sucked as waiters/waitresses (see spoon story above), they were great bartenders.  I would easily give this place 4 or 5 stars when it comes to drinks.

Will I come back?  Maybe, but I will not order food here again.  It is a shame since this is the only Irish Pub in Champaign/Urbana.  No, Murphy's does not count as an Irish Pub or anything.  Using a green shamrock and an Irish name doesn't make a bar an Irish Pub.",3
8157,3,1549152000000,"This Monro used to be a 5 star review about 4 years ago when it was under different management. The last time I tried to use their service a few weeks ago I was quoted $3,000 to fix several things. I know a good amount about fixing cars and when they read off the list of things that needed done I knew that some of it was necessary. Then the manager tells me that they can only order a certain part from the dealership and that each one was $650.00. So I believed him and said screw it, I'm not putting that money into my car. I checked online and aftermarket struts are available for this vehicle. Two weeks later I took another car up there to get a quote to get it up and running. I was figuring in the $1000.00 range, again I have been working on cars for over 2 decades, I asked them to just do the bare minimum and we will work on the rest later down the line. I get a call from a low level mechanic telling me that we are looking at $3000.00 in repairs! What are the odds of 2 cars being brought in there in a 2 week span, both needing the same amount of money to repair?!? This is shady business practice and I will never use Monro again.

A week ago I stopped in and while the service was extremely slow disorganized and obviously feuding,  I was happy with the food. And one line member gave me the suggestion that since I order a salad with double steak I would need to have some of my salsa and sour cream on the side because of the lack of space (or skill) when finishing my salad. I do not order chips or anything else just the salad and I prefer two dressings since it's only filled a third of the container. However when returning last night not only was I so rushed and pushed through the line that I forgot an ingredient but I was told that if I was to order my salad the way I was instructed to that they would charge me extra. So not only did I leave with a disappointing salad but I was also in a sour mood from the snotty rude manager who stepped in without any idea of what was going on.

The beers were flowing here. Dozens of microbrews that I need to get to know better as well as Guinness, black and tans, and Unibroue Terriblé...a 10.5% ABV, 12 oz challice of dark strong flavorful brew.  Pints are $5-8 depening on how obscure a beer you are ordering.  But there is crazy selection.  Try something different. 

Did you know, in this town....and I guess in this state, you don't buy your beer in the grocery store?  You gotta go to spots like this for a sixer.  If you need a beer, pint or to-go, this is an effin' cool spot. mix and match a sixer.

We tried a bunch of dogs, wings and beers.  

The crew here managed to keep our glasses full even though it was packed on st. patrick's day.

We tried a few dogs: the mac and cheese brat (with bacon)....really! bacon, mac n cheese on an effin' hotdog, a bacon cheddar brat and something called the mason-dixon, which was french fries & coleslaw on a dog.  All the dogs were good eats.  You can get your order vienna, veggie, turkey, cheese brat, or on a spicy dog.  The dogs arrive well grilled with a little bit of crisp blackening going on.  There are a shit load of additional toppings you can request (avacado, bacon, various mustards, saurkraut, etc.) and they seemed to be free...at least we didn't get charged anything additional .....Everything was included in the dog prices.

Wings were ok.  We did dry wings: jerk, spicy ranch, and parmesean.  They were all decently meaty.  The parmeseans with a side of the spicy mayo were good stuff, distinct flavor and good for dipping.  The other flavors of dry wings were ok. Mostly just salty, but ok.",2

I ordered The Suppli Amatriciana which has  bacon, tomato sauce and Pecorino-Romano. For under $3 it was a great snack and tasted great. The wait was a little long but the counter girl explained whenever she delivered it that he first was burned. 

Other items that they offered were pizza. Maragrita pizza was about $8. A good size personal pizza or could easily be split. I believe it was a 4 cut. They also offer calzone.. Fried or baked. Plus a half calzone half margarita pizza item.

8204,2,1550880000000,"My hubby and I stopped in here last night for a drink and some apps, we sat at the bar. We have been here a few times before and it seems that every time we go we see our favourite bartender, Steve. Steve is awesome!

I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio and my husband got a Kettle One straight up on the rocks. We ordered the Asian Nachos and Coconut Shrimp. They are both delicious!!  

The nachos come on five big pieces of a crispy wonton like base with veggies and chicken marinated in a delicious dressing and topped with melted cheese and sour cream. You have to try these, they're so good!  You can eat them with your hands but that can be really messy, it's much easier to eat them with a fork and knife, unless you don't mind getting your hands dirty. ;)

The shrimp was cooked perfectly and came with a horseradish Dijon sauce for dipping. It complimented the coconut shrimp perfectly. The horseradish hits you when you first put it in your mouth, but it's not a hot horseradish, just a really great flavorful one. There is also some orange zest in the sauce and while it was a little too much orange for my palate, it did work well with the dish as a whole. 

My husband then ordered a Mojito. Apparently it was the best Mojito he has ever had in a restaurant, and that's honestly saying something!  So if you like Mojitos get Steve to make you one the way he would drink it, double shot and all!  My husband had two!  

I ordered the Banana Coconut Cream Pie while my hubby drank his second and it was so yummy!  It came in a short mason jar with a crunchy granola like base with oats and coconut layered on top was a thick cream with fresh slices of banana, and topped with whipped cream and toasted coconut. It was the perfect portion size. 

This place may be out of the way and a challenge to find if you're not familiar with the area but it is definitely worth a visit!",1

8210,2,1549756800000,"täkō is considered to be one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh and it's for a reason. Both times I've eaten there it has exceeded my expectations.

täkō is an upscale eatery in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh that brings SoCal Mexican food with deluxe ingredients. They have fantastic cocktails, a great venue, and unique tacos.

The drinks: täkō has a great selection of margaritas that pair perfectly with their tacos and appetizers like Queso Fundido (a creamy queso made with shishito, chorizo, scallions, cilantro). I recommend the Oaxaca  and Grapefruit margaritas, although the Classic is solid as well.

Both their guac and Queso Fundido are great starters, but the focal point of the menu are their selection of tacos. Ranging from their tangy Korean Short Rib to the savory Chorizo to their legendary Octopus. They have a variety of tacos that all seem to hit the mark with fresh flavors and unique ingredients that add new twists on classic tacos. The standout is the obviously unique octopus taco. It delivers meaty but tender grilled octopus with small accoutrements that bring out the delicious flavor of the octopus. It's a must get if you visit.

All in all the perfect place to spend a Friday evening. Try to get a spot at the small outside bar. You sit next to the kitchen and get to watch the whole process, definitely a great atmosphere. It's not cheap, but it's not ridiculously priced either and for the food you get it's worth every penny

TLDR: Delicious upscale taco place in the middle of downtown. Grab a Oaxaca margarita if you like mezcal, if not go for the grapefruit. Tacos are the focus, they're all tasty but at least get the octopus as it's in a class of its own.",2

If your kids are older, you can just watch them from the waiting lounge as it looks straight at the play area.

8226,1,1549756800000,"Oh, the horror, the horror..............

Okay not really. More of a disappointment and a bummer.

In a nutshell- apathetic General Manager acting as expeditor sent out food that should not have gone out to clients. He should have looked at it first- nothing major, a baked potato cut down the middle with a large black ""tumor"" of rot hidden beneath the skin at one end. Could happen to anyone at home, I didn't want a free meal, but I thought that as expeditor he should be more alert.  His response was no response until he waited on me at the register, where his comeback to the issue was ""it was an eye.""  No, it was not a potato eye- they are external root sprouts and not black- and even so, what restaurant serves potatoes without trimming eyes?  He proceeded to grow increasingly more condescending, apathetic, and overtly rude albeit being rude using ""kind"" words- the dismissive ""thanks for coming and you have a nice day"" said in a tone of voice that essentially translates to ""F off.""  He just would not take ownership for the oversight, and obviously is not a person to learn from his mistakes. He's in the wrong business.  I have had salads served to me with the huge copper staples from the lettuce crate in my salad and expected nothing but for the prep cook in the pantry to use more diligence when washing and chopping lettuce. I didn't even want an apology, just a simple acknowledgment that there was an oversight that needed to be more closely heeded before sending food out from the line. All I got was attitude from a young man whose age I double, but who believes that he knows much more than I do and whose authority is not to be challenged. 

My server Emmy was great, she got a 30% tip from me. That manager netted a phone call to Cracker Barrel customer service. I've eaten at Cracker Barrels all over the USA for 21 years now, and have never been addressed or treated so rudely as my experience today.  Hopefully corporate in Lebanon, TN will sort this fellow out.",2
8230,3,1550793600000,"Let me start by saying we have been to Johnny's several times and have always had good service and great food. This past trip both of those things were still great but it was the atmosphere that was questionable at best.  It was a Wednesday evening, which I know isn't a typical date night, but that's when we could get a babysitter for our 2 kids under 3. The majority of the customers on this evening were ""business""men. The conversation, which we could hear very clearly consisted of the type of talk you'd expect from men with a poor vocabulary. No problem, just guys blowing off steam. It got uncomfortable when they started repeatedly turning and looking at and talking about my wife. I get it, she's pretty. But it started to make her uncomfortable. To the point where she was nervous to use the restroom. When she did go, they were literally making hooping noises at her and then talked to each other about going and meeting her in the restroom. I made sure they realized that I could hear them, but it only made them talk one decibel lower. When she returned, again with the staring and hooping. It tested my patience, but I figured it was a classy restaurant and they would take care of it. But that's where I have the problem. I know you can't help the behavior of your customers, but if they are unruly you can ask them to calm it down or at the very least apologize to the other customers. Nothing. And there is no question that they could be heard by the wait staff and the bar. They were sitting very close to the bar. It seems that this behavior is acceptable and not given a second thought. Johnny's looks and feels like a restaurant from another era, but maybe that's the problem. It's the era where it's acceptable to sexually harass a woman and receive no consequences for it. This trip was probably our last. There are too many good restaurants in Cleveland to waste time at one where you are going to feel uncomfortable.",2

The Chicken Fried Chicken was excellent! The Pecan Fried Chicken was incredible! The red skin mashed potatoes are the real deal! No box potatoes here.

8334,2,1551225600000,"We were in town for a couple of days and looking for a bite on Saturday night.  After we checked online and saw no available reservations, we called and they told us that since it was a huge tourist weekend (the last of spring training), they were holding most of their tables for walk-ins.

So we headed down and were quoted a wait of 15-20 minutes.  Off to the bar!  The place seemed pretty packed and buzzing.  A couple of local brews later, our table on the patio (as requested) was ready.

Service was perfectly friendly and helpful.  We shared a plate of ham, mustard and bread to start.  I had the sloppy joe, my boyfriend had the pastrami sandwich.  Food was solid, but short of phenomenal.  It's a fairly curated menu considering the size of the place.  You know where you see 6-7 options that sound just okay but nothing that sounds like ""OH MY GOD I HAVE TO EAT THIS NOW""?  That was pretty much my feeling towards their offerings - hence the sloppy joe.  

Only hitch was that I ordered a glass of wine and wound up getting charged for a bottle - a fact I didn't catch until I reviewed the receipt the next day.  But I gave them a call today and the management happily agreed to refund the difference.  (Thanks guys!)  I was happy with their selection of wines by the glass - they seem to make a point of serving some of the less available varietals.

8339,2,1549411200000,"I travel extensively for work, so I tend to eat sushi 1 to 2 times per week as it is my go to, healthy meal on the road. I don't like to stray from my favorites very much, but as a birthday treat, my girlfriend wanted to take me here because we've heard such great things. Sadly, we were both a bit disappointed. 

Don't get me wrong, the quality of the sushi here is top notch. You will not find better quality anywhere. 

However, we found the dishes to be relatively boring and uninspired. With our coursing, one of the dishes was a simple sliced Kobe beef that we had to cook on our own... A bit of a disappointment when we are paying approximately $100 per person for service. Another dish was a seared ahi tuna salad...again, excellent quality, but something I can get pretty much anywhere.

Lastly, the waitstaff was not knowledgeable for a restaurant of this supposedly high caliber. I ordered a nigori sake as I typically do. The waiter did not know that it needed to be shaken prior to serving, so when he poured it, it was clear, leaving all the sediment at the bottom. As I was trying to explain his mistake, he just wasn't understanding it. Eventually another member of the staff came over (someone from the kitchen I believe) as they understood the dilemma. To my dismay, they simply took the glasses of sake they had poured, poured them back into the bottle,  shook it up, then poured our glasses again. Can you imagine a high-end restaurant pouring a glass of wine back into a bottle and then serving it?! Never!

Again, the quality of the sushi was impeccable...Comparable only to what I had in Japan at the fishmarket. This quality alone warrants the three-star rating. Had this not been the case, I probably would've rated them lower. If you want the absolute best quality sushi you can get in the area and are willing to pay an exorbitant price for it, then this place will certainly fit the bill. I, however, will not be going back as I can find restaurants that provide a far better overall experience for half the price.",2

4)They only have the cinnamon spice beignets (no raspberry filled).  Also, these are cake like donuts NOT the yeast doughnuts as in N'awleans Cafe Du Monde.  Very different.

The thing I didn't like about the place was any changes or deviations from the menu was always an upcharge and our waiter was not very helpful in that regard.  Also, when I asked for 2% milk for my coffee, he said I only have whole or non-fat, then brought a full glass of non fat milk.  I didn't want the full glass because it was for my coffee and I felt he intentionally did that since I wanted to drink my coffee with the doughnuts but he said he thought I wanted a full glass of milk with my doughnuts when I already had my coffee in front of me.  Also, when I was making reservations for this brunch, the person on the phone was very snooty.  I was tempted to not go through with this but had already planned on the menu and with such good reviews, we had to give it a try but I think there needs to be discussion from management to staff about the attitude they project and represent to customers.  Unless you want to out snob the wait staff, there are friendlier places to eat at in Vegas.  The food was good but the interaction with staff from making reservation to wait staff could use some improvement.",1

If you're on the one side of the course, the 407 noise is a little bit annoying, and there are power lines overhead in spots, but they do not hinder the experience.

For the cost, the value is quite superb. Good place to practice your irons. For the price you can't beat it, and it sure is a lot more enjoyable then the driving range!

8437,1,1550275200000,"After reading other reviews, seems like I really need to visit this place more often. 

I came here once for brunch after reading that it one of the best Eggs Bennys ('heart attack benny') in Blogto. it was 10:30am and the place seemed kind of a dive. We were the only ones there, but the atmosphere picked up after more people trailed in around 11:30. 
The food was GOOD, and probably could have given me a heart attack. 

Today we came here after an awesome dinner at Nazareth, for some drinks and dessert. 
LOVE the smores (mini sammiches with 'fluff' and nutella and vanilla ice cream to dip) and fried Mars Bars. 
The desserts were $5 (prices include taxes, how awesome, +1 star). 

Now to go back and try this Grilled Cheese.",3

Thank god I wasn't there for any feminine issues. Overall the wait at the Urgent care was pretty sucky. I am a nurse so I get the triage process but the waiting room was fairly empty and for the people who were waiting and getting upset the front desk should do a better job of explaining the process.

As a tourist, the thing that I found frustrating is that they do not spread any bagels for customers. All spreads (cream cheese, lox, etc.) have to be bought separately.
However, the bagels were still delicious. They had a certain sweetness to them. And they did not feel heavy. I ate like two in one sitting... ok, maybe three. Then I froze the remainders, defrosting them and toasting them throughout the week. They were not as soft but still retained their flavour.

I almost never find myself on this side of town, but a friend's retirement party does give some merit. On the way there I knew I needed a little caffeine and even though I trying to break up with Starbucks... They are the easiest way to get caffeine in my system when I'm on the go. 

Pulled up to the drive through & asked if they had any hazelnut drizzle (shot in the dark) They didn't so I ordered a iced green tea late w/ coconut milk, may as well give it a try. The coconut milk was not my favorite. It gave the latte a distinct, weird flavor. The drink was still edible, but not that good.

 Anyway, Shane the barista was simply delightful! Hands down best barista I have ever come across. Extremely friendly, genuine and knowledgeable - What a great combination. Just when I'm ready to cut Starbucks loose they pull me back in. 

Although an amazing barista 45 minutes from my house will never make up for discontinuing hazelnut drizzle. I mean what are the thinking? It's the best drink ever. I just want to cry knowing I'll never have another hazelnut macchiato. I can not write enough sternly worded emails over this very traumatic experience. In case Starbucks ever reads this, I also want to say, adding coconut milk is a nice gesture, but everyone knows almond milk goes much better in dairy-free coffee. Ridiculous!",2

No worries, though, as it was still quite delicious & filling.

First impression was the cute bar decor right by the entrance and its chic new age contemporary design from the portraits, boutique chandelier of bottles, to the huge mural on the wall.

There is NO additional cost to eat or have drinks.  On our return trip, the airlines upgraded us from coach to business class.  Those seats were fantastic!

Salad was very basic - iceberg lettuce with a smattering of other greens and onions, some feta cheese, dressing - and one olive. Just one.

Then the platter came out - two pieces of Pita bread, several long thin pieces of Gyro meat, hummus, rice - and another Greek salad. Now why the hell didn't the guy who took my order bother to tell me I got a salad with my Gyro platter?

I ate the Pita and Gyro meat along with the hummus and most of the rice. Interestingly enough - this second Greek salad had - drum roll please.....

One olive! Must be an olive shortage in Pittsburgh. I did not eat the second salad as I was all salad-ed out at that point. I did eat the second olive though.

Food IMHO was just average - it felt more authentic than some of these places that serve you the Gyro meat wrapped up in a piece of Pita with a yogurt sauce.

I got one refill on my lemonade. The older gentleman who took my order was not particularly outgoing or friendly. In fact he was kind of gruff and standoffish - I was very friendly and polite during my visit.",3

For those who do not know chef Kenny, he owns other vegan restaurants as well. Upon walking in you are greeted with a warm welcome from the staff which is a good start to any restaurant. My family and I ordered the hot and sour soup, house special pan fried noodles, fish, roti with curry, and three different sushi rolls. I am all for trying out new things and love vegan restaurants, but this one just didn't live up to its hype. Two out of the three sushi rolls we ordered tasted the same, the only one that tasted different was the spicy tuna roll only because it had a spice factor to it. The house special pan fried noodle looked very appealing and almost looked like it wasn't vegan at all, but after trying the shrimp, beef, and chicken they all had no flavor at all which was quite disappointing. However, my favorite dish would have to be the Roti with the curry. The Roti was fluffy and the curry had potatoes inside for you to dip in. However, the staff needs to be heavily worked on. With our Roti and curry, we weren't even finished yet and they took it away assuming we were done with it without even asking. Secondly, the place is very cramped. Luckily when we went it wasn't busy, but if it was a full house then it would feel very cramped as the tables are literally one feet from the next table. I could literally touch the table next to me if I barely reached out my arm. Also, the price of the food is quite pricey as well. For three rolls, a fish, house special noodles, and roti with curry, and hot and sour soup, our total came out to be over 80 dollars. Overall this place to me is a solid 3.5 stars because of the service and pricing of the food. Will I come back? Possibly, to try their lunch special. Will I recommend this place to friends?

The steak was real tenderized round steak, but it was deep fried with the coating hard and burned. The green beans were shriveled and dry, obviously not fresh but reheated from the night before. The biscuit was OK, but no butter and the little cup of marmalade had a dry skin over it, having been left uncovered in a cooler for who knows how long. The ice tea was OK, but nothing to write home about. On second visit I had the breakfast platter special du jour. Again, the ice tea was OK. But the skillet meal looked like something that had been made up of whatever would soon be by its fresh due date. How can they get away with serving dry wrinkled chopped bell peppers?

We all ordered something different and got tons of sides for the table.  I thought I was safe getting the steak and it was over cooked which was a bummer. Everyone that got fish was disappointed in its flavor and appearance. Desserts were nice the starters were good and the creamed corn didn't disappoint. It's our last visit I'm afraid.

I was very surprised after descending the stairs to find a very well lit, clean, and nicely decorated dining room. We were seated promptly upon entering. We tried two of the salsas Casera and Tomatillo Verde. Both tasted fresh and had good flavor, I was happy that they were not at all spicy as I'm not a fan of overly hot(spicy) foods. My main dish I ordered was from the Dinner menu, I thought that was cool that they were setup to make food from their Lunch and dinner menu. I tried the Traditional Moles since I thought it would give me a quick general sampling of what they can do. This dish contained 4 different mole styles. I don't know if they make their mole sauces in house but I would hope that they do... It was pretty darn good, the only complaint I had was that the Chicken in the chocolate mole was extremely dry. The serving size was pretty large and I definitely brought a portion home with me.

The service was outstanding and I can't believe how quickly they got our food out to us after ordering, the place did have about 4 other tables , by no means was it full but for a lunch you could definitely get done in well under an hour.

They are currently upgrading all of the guest rooms and I was told that I was in one of the newer rooms. The hotel is quiet. There's no restaurant in the hotel. However, they have snacks and drinks available for purchase downstairs, there is a nearby restaurant that delivers (menu was in the room) and breakfast is complimentary. Breakfast had a great spread including croissants, bagels, toast, muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, boiled eggs, oatmeal with several mix in, cereal, eggs, sausage, potatoes, juice, tea & coffee. There is always ice water available in the lobby if you have a cup or reusable water bottle to refill (great for those triple digit days!). There is a free hotel shuttle that will take you within a 5 mile radius of the hotel, which is super helpful since there are a ton of shops and restaurants nearby. There is a safe in the room that will fit a laptop as well as a microwave and mini-fridge. Overall a very nice stay!",3

An hour and a half after I placed my order, I wondered where my food was. Finally! A phone call! But alas, it was only the driver calling to tell me that he spilled my tea in the car. Would I like him to drive back to the restaurant, make a new one, and come back to Shadyside? No, my hunger couldn't wait more time in addition to the hour and a half. About ten minutes later, my food arrived. Salvation! I ran upstairs and to my kitchen table, ready to eat. I eagerly took my first bite of the suspiciously cold chicken.

Matsuda seems to be on a bigger scale - a bit bigger with more staff. Some items took quite some time to come.. naturally we thought they had forgotten the order and re-placed the order.. however they eventually came in doubles! Oh well.

8619,2,1549497600000,"I know, a little late, but here is our review for our stay, four nights at the Flamingo, just before 4th July 2014.
We may have been lucky, no queues at check in at all, and agreed to the $30 per night upgrade. That was our first win of the trip! Took a twin Go Deluxe room, loved having the fridge by the bed. View was sorta over to Caesar's, but hey, we weren't there to look out the window anyway, just check the weather in the mornings :-)
We found the Flamingo pleasant, clean, fun, bright. My only gripe was being charged $120!!!! For a blow dry in the salon. That's just pure insanity! 
We also rented a cabana on one day (over 40 degrees Celsius, glory be it was hot!) by the pool, and appreciated the towels, water, fruit, service, and safe. Having said that though, next time we'd probably just grab a daybed, and leave everything but the room key in our room, we spent so little time in the actual cabana! 
Vegas is over 12 hour flight away for us, but we're planning our next trip, and seriously considering the Flamingo again.",2

We ordered the fish and chips and the bbq baby back ribs and it was wonderful. The fish and chips are crispy and wonderful while the ribs fell of the bone and pretty flavorful.

8643,3,1548979200000,"I hate to do this, but they gave me no choice today. I usually get decent to good service from this Papa John's location, but today indicated a trend in the wrong direction. I have no problem if it takes an hour and 20 minutes for a delivery to arrive. I get that some nights downtown are busy.

However, when your system has the pizza tracker function, and I know when things are happening, it is likely to make me a bit nervous when the delivery estimate is 25 minutes and it takes an hour and 25. The pizza tracker showed that my pizza was done baking 15 minutes after I placed my order. The ""boxing"" stage normally takes like a minute, but this time it took 15. Thus, it showed it was ""on the way"" 30 minutes after I placed my order. I finally called at the 1:15 mark to check if it was actually on the way, and the person with whom I spoke said it was on the way. I had mentioned it was over an hour since I placed the order, and the person snarked that it had been 57 minutes, which is way off. It had been at least 1:15 (confirmation email at 7:05pm, delivery estimate for 7:30pm, call placed at 8:20). Five minutes later, my order arrived.

Because it had, in theory, finished baking at 7:20 or earlier, I was worried it would be cold or soggy (since I ordered extra sauce). The box was warm, so I was hopeful. The contents were not. The crust on most pieces just basically fell apart. The toppings and sauce were lukewarm, but the crust was cold. The driver must be a smoker, as the bag holding my 2 liter reeked of smoke.

I would call to get them to send another one out, but I'm going to be late for someplace I need to be shortly. We'll see if my review inspires some action.

In short, I suggest they avoid putting incorrect or unrealistic expectations out there - arming customers with this much information and then falling short is a bad look. As I mentioned, I have had plenty of good experiences from this location, but the last 2 or 3 have gotten progressively worse. So much for using up my Papa's Points for a ""free"" pizza.",2

While we were sitting at our table waiting for the pizza, a black gentleman came and was complaining on how bad the pizza was burnt to the owner. Instead of giving this gentleman a new pizza, the owner took the pizza and slams on ground and start cursing at black gentleman. The black gentle got upset and demand his money back but the owner would not let take and threaten to throw him out.. so the black gentleman walked out but the owner follows him making sure the black man gets out of his pizza place.. Owner should have kept his mouth shut.. but nooo, he kept yapping his mouth away and next thing you know, the black man knockout the owner.

Our dining mate who had the steak, didn't like it. Aside from being over done it came smothered in sauce that looked like cherries (but was onions) so it was not what she was expecting and she ate about half. Had anyone asked she would have said so, but no one checked during or after to see if she enjoyed it. 

The service was slow, it took at least 30 min for the mini burgers to arrive and just as long to receive our bill when we done.

Dining with a group, we splurged on the seafood tower and although insanely expensive, it was top quality for the evening. The pricing here is really expensive across the board however they clearly haven't cut any corners on decor and staff.

That's how I feel about this place. I mean, that's kinda how I feel about the North Shore restaurant options right now. The Tilted Kilt? No thanks. Now Pittsburgh Grill. Ugh. 

I walked through the back end of the restaurant, through the patio, to join my friends for dinner before a show at Stage AE. I went through the whole restaurant three times trying to find them. I finally found them in the front Cigar Bar because they said that was the only available open area (sorry, but so gross smelling). The hostess had told them the wait would be 20 minutes. Um, hold up here... something's fishy.

So I ask the server if that's for real. She said, yes, it's a 20 minutes wait. But here's the thing. The bar was packed in the back, but the tables... I'm going to guess they were probably 1/3 full with guests, the rest were completely empty. In my complete and utter shock I blurted out ""but there's hardly anyone sitting at the tables!"" And she simply responded, ""they're all dirty."" CLEARLY, they were not all dirty. I have eyes. I saw no dirty tables. 

I know I repeat this til I""m blue in the face, but I've been a hostess and server. Just tell me the truth. My guess is that they were understaffed. Why they were understaffed could obviously be a couple different reasons. Bad planning or people calling off. There's a sold out concert across the street though, schedule accordingly. 

Anyway, maybe, just maybe things could get better if the food was good. Not so much. I ordered a portobello burger and sweet potato fries. The portobello was smothered in mozz cheese and was pretty bland. The sweet potato fries were the saving grace. They were good.

The muffin was also really warm and everything was melty. Yum! The garlic parmesean fries were really fresh and tasty too a la carte.

For lunch I ordered their club sandwich, which always seems like a Vegas classic to me. I like how they subbed the usual extra piece of bread for more turkey :D. Their fries were also really hot and crispy. My BF ordered a BBQ cheeseburger. He thought it was delicious! Nice bun & patty.",2

Try the chicken cutlet panini, or the gnocchi, both were delicious, and you could tell that the food had been prepared with fresh ingredients. Their sangria is also pretty tasty, check that out as well.

The only downside was that it took a while for us to get our food, and there were only a few other parties being served at the time. I mean it was definitely worth the wait, but if you're in any sort of a hurry, this isn't the place to stop for a quick bite to eat.

8743,1,1549497600000,"I keep waffling between 2 and 3 stars--2.5 is appropriate. Banfield is to pets what Nextcare is to people. They're available when you can't get into your regular healthcare doc and will allow quick turnaround on service at a decent price. 

The issue I'm having is their immediate upsell on tests and ""extra's"" and also when it comes to vaccinations and medication. In today's economy, I can't believe that Banfield would put such a hard sell for unnecessary items like they did with me on the last two visits. People don't have a lot on extra money to throw around--that's why they're coming to Banfield in the first place, right? 

Our last visit my dog Fezzy had an eye infection and his vaccinations were due so I asked for a price quote. The first step was to upsell me on tests (allergy tests, skin tests, etc) and then also to upsell me on the vaccinations and give him more than just Rabies and Bordatella. There was a shot for parvo (seriously? thought that was just once when they were puppies) and one other disease I didn't remember. 

After the vet examined Fezzy the tech came back and listed 5 medications for him, everything from an anitbiotic, an analgesic, an eye wash, an eye ointment and an allergy pill. Total bill was to be $465. I scrapped the vaccinations (can get them done at the Phx Spay/Neuter Clinic for much cheaper--$40) and all the extra tests--and when I was looking over the needed meds I noticed that the eye ointment was listed at $84.99! For a tube of triple antibiotic eye ointment. Essentially we're looking at spending $85 on a tube of neosporin. I was shocked! The tech said that the vet could give me a presricption for that one to take to my pharmacy if I felt it was too expensive. I immediately agreed.  I took the rest of the meds and with the appointment the total came to $105. 

Here's the kicker--I called 1800PetMeds--the price for the ointment: $35.99 plus shipping--oh it gets better! I called CVS on 7th Street--$24.99 but they'd have to order it. It gets even better than this---So I dropped it off at CVS on 16th and Camelback and went to pick it up in the afternoon--price was $15.99! A whole $70 cheaper than Banfield! Can you believe that markup???

In the end it took 30 minutes to get noodle bowls for lunch. When we started seeing people getting their bowls before us of course we asked about it and were told the other table had their cards filled out before us. Well okay I suppose, I wasn't really paying that close attention but I did watch our server waiting at the counter. So food comes out, not all at the same time so a coworker had to wait while everyone had theirs. She had rice. Come on...I know the rice and noodles are prepared ahead of time. Why is it taking so long? 
Another coworker commented that her noodles were burned. I checked mine-some were burned as well.  The server gave her another bowl which tasted much better. I will say the the shrimp I had was good and my friends like their proteins as well
So $10 for 4 decently cooked shrimp, half burned noodles and a 30 minute wait when we were one of the first to be seated. Not worth it to me so I won't come back.",2

bah bah baba, bah bah babaaaaaa

Oh yeah, I was at the MGM Grand Garden Arena to see the Holy Triumvirate play a few weeks ago.  Although parking was the most awful I have ever experienced in Vegas, the arena itself kicks ass compared to Mandalay Bay.  There's really not a bad seat in the house, and as others have said, I would not recommend floor tickets.

As for the band themselves, man there's not much to say except it was incredible.  All three of them are some of the most talented musicians I have ever seen.  The show was almost four hours, one of the longest concerts I have been to that only showcased one band.  But hey, this is Rush, who doesn't feel the need to have an opening band when they have  thirty-five years worth of material to play.  On top of it, they played the ENTIRE Moving Pictures album, and had some really great videos of Jason Segel and Paul Rudd hilariously fawning over them as their characters in ""I Love You Man.""  It looks like they filmed the video just for Rush's tour.  

Anyway, if you get a chance to see an arena concert in town, this venue is the best so far in Las Vegas.  I'm only knocking a star off for MGM's inability to get their act together with parking.",3

Unfortunately I will probably never go back to this venue. This was not my first time here but will be my last.


We went to the Chalk Circle/ Blue Peter show this past Friday, january 21st. We had bought our tickets in advance for the show so we wouldn't have to wait and could just go in. HAHAHAHAHA so much for being pro-active!
The concert by the way started at 8:00pm??? okay we can work with that, got to the Mod Club and had to wait in line????????????? For what I have my ticket!!!!!!!! missed the first half of the show because I had to wait in sub-zero temps, just so the bouncers at the door had something useless to do. WHY am I waiting in line to see a show I've already paid for????  Oh and we didn't get to check our jackets because we would have had to wait again and miss even more of the show!

The show once we were in was really great and I can only say good things about both performances. (that I did get to see!) 

The show ended promptly at 10:00pm, okay we will stay and hang out for awhile.HAHAHA they shut everything down on us!!! They turned on the overhead lights, shut the bars ETC..........because they were setting up for a DJ.
Honestly, there is nothing like being kicked out of a place at 10:00, no one announced last call!!!!!!!! I felt like a geriatric being forced to go home to bed!!!

He definitely was very eager and happy to help us out as we navigated their menu. You could tell he loved his job and that this was a way of life for him and not just a job. 
Now the food on the other hand, was in one word, phenomenal. I had the farmers pizza which had sausage, bacon, as well as a egg on top of the slices.

But about two days after her spaying she began to vomit A LOT and I noticed she had been licking her wound, so I tried to get her to stop by she just wouldn't. Her wound eventually opened up as I was about to leave to go buy a collar and red puss was everywhere. She seemed very depressed and sad and in pain. She was throwing up probably at least three times a day and eventually I just said I have to take her back. I called for the free recheck exam and they were nice enough to get me on the same day, an hour later which I was so unbelievably thankful for because she was scaring me so much. All the vet techs remembered her and made her feel welcome and comfortable. They were so unbelievably kind as to give her a free of charge shot, and cleaning wipes to disinfect her wound. Of course the anti biotics that she needed and her E-Collar wasn't free but that was ok, the prices were great! For all that they've done and the tips they gave me and the diet they told me to put her on the total cost (not including the actual spaying) was $35. I'd say that's an amazing deal. My only issue was involving the actual spaying but even then it's very minor and honesty not that big of a deal... I was thinking that the spaying was going to come out to be at least $100 (she was in heat), but by surprise there was an additional $15 for meds- which is totally understandable but it just caught me off guard since this is my first time getting a dog spayed- I just wished in addition of telling me that there is an additional charge when they're in heat that they would've told me that they would also give meds with another charge.

If I were to nitpick I wish  they included just a couple more cubes of tofu in the lunch order. Music in this place was an improvement to the previous establishment which only played Korean pop songs. Sorry, for a non-Korean I find that music annoyingly whiney & repetitive. The decor hasn't changed much inside except for those lit bottles on the wall. Outside tho, they built a nice patio.

It's restaurant week.  We came in Wednesday, it was dead.  They took 10 minutes to even acknowledge us at the host desk. Despite the fact there were only 2 other tables in the main restaurant area and the tiny bar was full, the service was ridiculously SLOW.  It took them an hour and a half to give us beginning-to-end service.  We are fast eaters and we didn't dilly-dally.  We had the chips & queso, which was the BEST queso we've ever had.  Eventually we got the sliders, and they were tasty.  Fries were average.  Dessert was delicious.

We cut them some slack, it was slow, we weren't in a rush and the food was so yummy, we didn't worry about the disorganization and slow service.  

It's Friday.  We decide to go there again, our teenaged nephew is with us.  We didn't have reservations, it's still restaurant week, so we knew we would have to wait.  Honestly didn't think that the disorganization from the other night was a constant...we were wrong.  It was WORSE.

We arrived at 6:05, and weren't acknowledged until 6:10, and no one was in front of us.

We got on the wait list at 6:12 and were told it would be about 30 minutes.  There was one booth open, 3 low tables, almost the entire tall boy (which seats 20 or more/""community"" style) was open, and there was a table in the bar open. 

At 6:34, the hostess told us she could seat us outside because no other tables were available.  However, 6 more tables had LEFT during this time, and only a good portion of the large high boy had been seated.  


She then said they had a ""bunch"" of reservations at 6:45, and that they ""usually don't show up"", so we could wait and see if they did or didn't, but if any tables opened up in the meantime, we could be seated.  Then, like magic, three tables/booths got up and left.  But we still would have to sit outside.  

In the meantime, three other groups had walked in without reservations and left because they didn't want to wait 30 min for a table.  Two other groups chose to wait and went outside.  At this point, there were more people waiting for tables without reservations than there were seated in the restaurant.  One more reservation showed and sat in the booth.  So all the tables that were empty when we walked in, except the high boy and a booth, were STILL EMPTY.  

We left at 6:35, and told the groups waiting outside what happened.  I don't know if they stayed or not.

So my advice?  Order by phone and pick it up.

The other glaring problem is that no one appears to have a designated job.  Everyone was running and doing everyone's job except for hosting and bartending.  Chaos.  Disorder. 

No wonder service is terrible.

They need to hire a manager with restaurant management experience.  The owner seems to think she can do it, but she can't.  

I hope they get their act together.  The food and drinks are outstanding.  The place is beautiful.  I want them to succeed.  But they will sink like a lead ship if they don't get organized and learn how to manage reservations appropriately.",2

She wouldn't really answer my questions as she was busy and didn't ask many either so her diagnosis was based on a guess at best. The fee to be not even thoroughly examined was a tad ridiculous. But this is not the worst part. They prescribed a weak antibiotic that did not take care of my infection. To then get an adequate antibiotic they require a new visit with new huge co-pay. But I am not even really seen by a doctor, they just ask oh you still have it, here is your prescription. I asked why they couldn't just do that over the phone and I am told they require the additional visit so they can charge me again. If they had prescribed the correct antibiotic the first time this would not have been needed. But either they are running a scam knowing that it wouldn't do the job or the doctor couldn't figure out what was needed in her through 3 minute exam with minimal questioned asked.

Part of what I love about Noodles Ranch is their ability to provide fast and tasty take out.  They package it right, so it's still hot and fresh by the time you get home.  This may not be a big deal for most people, but when you live so far away from civilization, like me, this is an impressive feat.  

The Service is always good, and often interesting.  I wanted to know if their coconut water was fresh once, and you should've seen the look the server gave me (hilarious!!!).

Despite the proudly featured margarita ads and the house tequila being top-shelf Cabo Wabo, they had no drink list, and minimally described only 3 tequila-based drinks (which are available frozen, mentioned first).  They seemed much more interested in selling us beer.

Tortilla soup was decently spiced, but a little too salty and a little too thick.

Service was attentive to a fault (checking in with us every 5ish minutes).

The location, however, is quite awesome-- at a major crosswalk, across the street from new Aria, with a view of the booming fountains at Bellagio.  Good for taking in the strip while having a drink, if you sit outside.  They have some gas heaters on the deck for the winter, but this sort doesn't seem to give off much heat.

I order a Ham and Pineapple calzone. It wasn't the best I've had but it was still pretty good. My lunch companion ordered a gyro with a side of pasta salad, and I have to say that it looked better than my meal and cost about three dollars less. I tried the salad and the abundance of feta made it taste great. 

Other menu items include subs, pasta and salads (with or without lettuce. All the breads and crusts are made fresh daily on site.

My only complaints with this restaurant are that it's very, very small. So small that I noticed a table pushed entirely into the back corner so that only two chairs on the exposed sides could be seated at it. Also, I was quite literally back to back with the gentleman dining at the table behind me. It was also fairly busy (which speaks well for them and their business) and difficult to hear what my friend was attempting to tell me. Oh well, I doubt it was very important anyway...

The pretzel bun was super rock hard and was not pleasant to eat because it was cutting the roof of my mouth but we kept the dish anyways. The trip dipper came with honey chipotle wings, southwestern eggrolls, and big bite sliders. the sliders were cooked to death and it was so tough and dry, we will not be ordering that again. the honey chipotle wings were really good though, the sauce was sweet and tangy and the eggrolls were good as usual. I liked how they have the new table kiosks where you can split and pay your bill there without a lot of server interaction. Service was great but the food and wait, not so much.",2

Everything that I've tried was fantastic!!!! Great place for birthdays",2

8903,1,1551312000000,"Fairly newly opened in a space that was similar.  I had a good dinner experience & will return.
There was a nice selection of ""raw bar"" items -  oysters, mussels & shrimp.  There were four soups, though I didn't try any (egg drop, won ton, hot & sour + another).  There was also a few salad vegetables available.

The buffet was extensive - too many things to list.  I definitely had some string beans and cooked salmon.  The spinach & cheese had too much cheese for my liking, which was my minor complaint.  There was a sushi table, but I'm not a sushi eater.  My main course was a plate of freshly-prepared stir-fry that included items I selected from among meats/fish, vegetables, starches & sauces.  If I hadn't eaten so much raw shrimp & oysters, I'd have double-dipped the stir-fry.

For dessert, I had fresh cantaloupe & pineapple + ice cream (from among 6 flavors).  There were some pastries, but I didn't try any.  A refillable soft drink cost under $2, and not served buffet style; the server brings that + clears the plates.

The price was low for what can be had there.  The food is by no means spectacular, but it's certainly decent enough.  For those who want a gourmet meal, this probably isn't your spot.",2
8903,2,1550707200000,"As much as I want to give District One 5-stars....I can't. First let me be clear: this is a 5-star place. The food is amazing and I love the atmosphere. Sadly...the service was disorganized & nonexistent. The servers were very nice & when ours was present he was helpful but we spent more time waiting for him then we did speaking with him. Additionally, our food was run out by different people at different times - I was practically finished with my bowl of Pho when they brought the veg plate out for it. But the biggest disappointment of the evening: PARKING!  There was none. I parked in the shopping center next to it and walked; my friends parked across Jones & played Frogger trying to cross. This isn't the best area at 7pm on a Saturday night. It doesn't change for the better at 9pm. 

The menu District One has on their website is wrong. I had my heart set on lobster pho when I arrived but when I found out 1) the menu online is wrong and 2) the price was more than whats online I couldn't justify it. 

I really wanted something different so went with the rib eye pho. OMG is was delicious. Lots of noodles, perfect broth & the rib eye melted in my mouth. I hate going to Chinatown but I will just for this. 

Spring rolls were disappointing. Bland. Too much mint. Not sure what the crunchy pork was inside the roll. These are traditionally made with the pork and shrimp on the outside of the roll visible through the rice paper. And nowhere near the amount of mint crammed into this. It had absolutely no flavor and the peanut sauce wasn't about to help change it.  

Oxtail pho I heard was gorgeous, too. 

Shrimp skewers weren't cooked through. My friend is an idiot and doesn't send food back so she literally threw $8 away. ($3.99/each)

Came here for my birthday and overall I was very pleased. Will definitely come back...but not at 7pm on a Saturday night.",3

8923,2,1550534400000,"Went here for the first time after seeing the many good reviews.  It was busy and we had to wait a little while (10 min) even though we called it in about 15 minutes ahead of time.  Everything seems to be prepared fresh, there is an open kitchen in the back behind the register.  The low number of good Chinese places in the area make this one a must go to if you live nearby.  It's probably not worth traveling very far for.  This place serves a lot of pretty good food cheap, which is sometimes needed.  We'll definitely be coming back here since this is close to home.",2

There were people sitting at small tables outside and inside,but no waiters to be seen. So we stood by the register waiting for a while..and waited and waited.. then a small child peeked his head out from a curtain and asked if he could play with my daughter, I wondered where was this child parent? So then we sat at a table and looked at a menu. A lady walked by with a tray of drinks and served them to the table beside us(she didn't look to happy at all) Then walked past us like we were invisible. We finally decided to leave it was just to weird. We really wanted to give this place a chance especially since its a local business in old town Glendale.  Very dissapointing!!!",2

8940,2,1551139200000,"Disrespecful, Dirty, Slow, Racist, Carelesss, Dangerous to sum up my experiance why i will never go here 
I came here the first time after they changed the name from Kripsy Rolls. this was in 2006-2010 and went there decent amount time and every time we came in there they would always ask if we are in the right place, and said that indian/Hakka restaurant is next door. I didn't think much of it than but after awhile I understood what was going on. I felt it was racism, and they say we're in the wrong place every time we went in there. Imagine walking into a restaurant with your family and having the people ask you if your in the right place. I came here because I heard they had the best pho in town, and it was good. 

So they changed the name, to Spring N Fresh Rolls and I thought it would be different.
The venue looked dated, I peered in the kitchen and it looked like it needed a washing and cluttered I could see a huge rusty pot, on the stove top hoping that my food wasn't cooked in there. 

. I ordered the Chicken roll, calamari, and beef and chicken noodle soup. I asked them not to put any tomatoes because I had sever allergies to tomatoes. They said okay 

They bring the food, and it was decent, the soup was good, the calamari and rolls were dried. My lips were cut and I thought it was from the calamri. When we finished service was slow, and we were the only one in the restaurant near closing. When I got home my body broke out in hives and my tongue was severely bleeding. There was tomatoes in the food. and my body went in anaphylactic shock. It was either from the dip or chicken roll. My body is still hurting while I'm writing this review. 

This was a terrible experience, and the lack of care I could only imagine if my allergy was even more severe what would've happened to me. It baffles me how a restaurant can make such a careless mistake. And the mistake was made because of the lack of care they have place in our food, and their customers. Would never go there.",2

My husband is 100% Italian so needless to say, we are very picky when it comes to pasta and sauces. We both did a build your own pasta plate, I had vodka sauce with penne and sausage and my husband did linguini with pesto, sausage, and shrimp, and both dishes were to die for! On top of that, the homemade bread was ridiculously amazing and WARM! Service was excellent, atmosphere was great - we will definitely be back in the near future!",2

Thats how my typical time out here passes by. Chicken, the tea, the games over great company and laughs.

The first time this happened, the owner Chris was really good about making sure they paid to have our pool shocked and treated. We decided to continue to do business with them and give them another try. I was very disappointed last week to discover that once again, our 2 year old pool had no chlorine in it. I even had my husband run his own set of tests to make sure that mine were accurate. I was so upset that the same thing had happened again! Pool companies are a dime a dozen out here in Phoenix.  I would look elsewhere before doing business with CMK pools.",2
8970,2,1549670400000,"I had a terrible experience there. As we were waiting to be seated, the lady at the counter spoke to us in this very annoyed tone of voice, and kept on giving everybody annoyed looks. During dinner, we first ordered a 6 course meal, and they gave us free soup. However, because we had a few more people joined us, so the soup and food was gone fast. So we ordered for more food and asked for more soup. Before the food was served, they took away all our utensils along with the soup we asked for (it was still full), and only left us the tea. When we told the waitress who took our tableware away, and ask for replacement, because the elder really wanted the soup, I could not believe the waitress actually said it's already been taken away, she cannot replace it, and there's nothing she can do about it. So we ask for the manager on duty, the manager herself, only gave us new utensils, not a single sorry. The moment our food arrive, the waiter rush over to ask if we would like our dessert serve also. I did notice, they were closing, but it was around 10PM, so I think they were trying to rush us out. I still got to say this, we're paying customers!!

I personally would not even give this restaurant a star. However, Yelp requires at least 1 star.   

Terrible service,  food was alright, nothing special. Price was fair. 
Would I recommend/return? NO!!",3
8971,2,1548979200000,"Decent Chinese takeout- though a little slow (usually 20-30 min for a basic order- not ideal to swing by on the way home or a quick lunch).  However, you can order ahead, and while I'm generally suspicious when it comes to oriental restaurants, their kitchen (which you can see from the front counter) looks clean and I feel confident in what I'm eating and the food is pretty good. 
Their portions aren't quite as large as some other local places, but their prices are pretty average- it seems. 
So all and all, it's my current go-to for Chinese after a bad experience at my old local favorite. I say go for it!",2
8973,2,1550016000000,"Came in here on a Thursday night for the restaurant week . I'm so glad we checked this place out. I love French food and always sad that there wasn't a good one in town. We called in before we go and they were able to fit us in in a short notice. Probably because it was Thursday, I would recommend to plan ahead if going on a Friday night or weekends. When we got there, parking was a huge pain! Leave yourself 10-15 minutes extra for parking. Wish they can add valet service. 
The food! Ah my, best escargot, it was very tender and flavorful. I also had the smoked salmon carpaccio for appetizer. Excellent!
For our entry, we got the boeuf bourguignon, I wish it served with some pasta or so, it was a little bit salt to eat by itself. Dessert was very good as well, the chocolate mousse was very rich and the crepe was sweet.

The service was slow but our server was very polite. Also one thing learned over the dinner was you need to ask for check if you are finished. It is not polite to just bring you the check. They don't want you ever feel like they are rushing you out. I can't wait to go back there to check out the regular menu and I'm sure everything will be great!",2

Perhaps it was because we were in a big group which really shouldn't have an effect on anything but the service was piss poor.  So we ordered our food and gave the waitress the sushi ordering paper at the table.  Simple sushi...Inari, Tamago and California roll.  Easy right?  Should be out in 10-15 minutes!  That sushi came out when we were halfway done with dinner.  We ordered sake also, which we had to remind the waitress we ordered it because she forgot all about it.

8984,3,1550534400000,"I ordered the ""Macho Nachos Locos"" with xxxtra jalapeños and a pitcher of MGD.  They didn't think that was funny.  I said, ""Well, maybe a cucumber finger sandwich, then?""  

It was a weekday and I didn't have reservations.  They only have about eight tables so you should call ahead.  It took about 15-20 minutes to get a table.
After ordering tea, it took at least 45 minutes for food to arrive- no big deal for me.  I was prepared to wait because someone else on Yelp said plan on spending a couple of hours.  They were right- but if you like to sit and chat and sip tea, then you'll be fine.  Probably not a good lunch break stop though.  
I ordered Full Tea.  This will cost you $25.  The pic I posted is Full Tea for three. You'll get a pot of tea, a small scone, about a sandwich worth of finger sandwiches and a few bites of dessert.  Pricey for what you get but fun and well presented. 
Here's my complaints:  the Devonshire Cream was too sweet, too thin and too little.  It should be like a cross between unsweetened whip cream and unsalted butter.
Also, the water had a strange aftertaste.  It tasted like it had lemon and maybe cucumber in it but then there was this odd aftertaste. Not sure what was going on with that.  Lastly, that three tiered serving platter would have made a beautiful plate of nachos.  ""Quintealia's Tea Parlor and Nacho Casa.""  -just a suggestion...",2

8990,2,1551139200000,"My friends and I had a poor first experience at Rx Boiler Room last night. We arrived around 10:15pm looking for dinner. The restaurant was mostly empty except for a couple of bar patrons, 2 or 3 four tops and a party of 12 (or so) in the back. 

We were a party of 7, and it took the hostess a few minutes to figure out where to seat us.  The table selected needed to he cleaned so we waited a few minutes for that to happen. This was the first of several red flags for the night as it was over 5 minutes for the staff to clean and set the table 

After seating we ordered a round of drinks, water and some appetizers. The drinks arrived in 10 minutes, apps arrived in 15 minutes, and the waiter came around to get out dinner drink order. 

We had to ask for appetizer plates. Twice. Eventually they arrived. 

Another 10 minutes elapsed while the waiter informed a member if our party that her light beer wasn't available. Strange that they have Miller Lite and Bud Light but no Coors Light? Anyway, drink order was still incomplete as I was asked three times about which beer I had ordered (Innis and Gunn, off the menu). 

The food was decent. Not outstanding for the price, but acceptable. 

Approaching 45 minutes since our arrival, still no 2nd round and we hadn't ordered dinner. We made the decision to leave and a member of our party approached the manager.

The manager apologized (ok) and then proceeded to claim no knowledge of a problem (hmm), blame us for not saying something sooner (not ok), and then had the temerity to ask us to give his restaurant another try. FAIL. 

Sorry, mate. The manager should know what's going on. When he sees apps on the table, menus still on the table, no app plates, no drinks and it's been a while... He should stop by and ask if we are ok.  Instead he didn't engage, and as a result he lost is as customers. 
And I'm sharing our poor experience with other Yelpers in hopes that you won't suffer as we did. 

Epilogue: We walked to another restaurant in Mandalay Place, arriving a few minutes after 11. Within minutes we were seated, our drink order was promptly filled and food was quickly served. We finished, happily full, at 11:45.  Rx Boiler Room, take that as a lesson on how to serve customers.",2
8992,3,1550102400000,"Hubby found this place on Yelp, kudos to him! The food is as wonderful as the setting. We really enjoyed sitting outside under the trees on the picnic tables - it reminded me of some wineries I have been to.

The first visit I had the BBQ chicken pizza, hubby had the amazing fontina burger. That burger was spectacular. It has 6 oz., roasted red pepper, grilled mushrooms, field greens, farm-made pecan pesto and fontina cheese. I think its the pesto that makes it so special, but hubby thinks its all of the ingredients together that makes it.

My second visit I got the fontina burger, without the red peppers, with bacon and once again; it was outrageously delicious. I also got the fried green beans which I loved!

Their office gave me the number of this clinic and I was told I could drop in. It was my only day off in weeks and no others were in sight so it had to be done. The vet examined her and when I turned down the offer of blood tests and a cardiologist he agreed to euthanize her. He took her away for a first shot and returned her to allow me time to say goodbye. I left the exam room for the counter where my bill was presented. It was for $470. I questioned the amount, having been quoted less than $200 by my clinic of choice. I was told that only the ""doctor"" could amend the bill and did I wish to speak to him? I did. After ten minutes or so I was directed into an exam room, where I found my cat alert and the ""doctor"" next to her with a hypodermic needle in his hand. I am absolutely convinced that this was my punishment for questioning the charge - which incidentally included $100 for a five-minute exam ($9600 per eight hour day) and $80 to insert a catheter. He told me, when I raised the quote I had received, that he worked multiple clinics and his charge was pretty standard, and that what I was quoted was clearly only a part of what I would have been charged.

Nancy was very diligent making sure we pair our food perfectly. First came out the pork belly and the truffle mac and cheese. Every bite was delicious and went well with each other.
Second came our main plates: flat iron steak, pork chops, and the mushrooms. I would go back just for the mushrooms alone and the sauce.

9041,2,1550966400000,Happy hour is from 4-6 or 9-11p weekdays. There are plenty of $5 drinks and $5 appetizers as well. Food/drinks are tropical inspired delicious. Cajun shrimp and pina colada were my favorites. Very fun atmosphere. Try to get there early since it will get very busy. Huge parking lot and staff so friendly.,3
9047,1,1549756800000,Lawrys prime rib house where do I begin! This place is A+ when it comes to there food and service. I definitely recommend the Brady cut. Actually all cuts are good from California cut to the big bowl cut.,2
9051,1,1550188800000,"One should keep in mind that when they go to the Upper Deck, they should not lump it in with the quality of the lower level.  I found that comparably my experience was not as exceptional with the Upper Deck.  Unlike the lower level, where one can dine on all-day breakfast items, the Upper Deck serves more contemporary American fare.  You have the option of having poutine, tacos, fries, chicken wings, and other items that complement alcoholic beverages.  We went on a Thursday during Happy Hour, so several beverages were discounted to $5 per drink.  If you're a beer person, most of the draft beers are part of the Happy Hour deal, with the exception of the cider.  If you're into mixed drinks, you are somewhat limited, unfortunately. You get the basics like gin and tonic, one tequila shot, etc. I had the gin and tonic, a concoction that has become my new personal favourite after a co-worker introduced it to me at a low key Chinatown bar.  To my dismay, I felt that there was far more tonic than on average, so it tasted like regular soda with an undertone of lime and alcohol.  It was still refreshing, but it could have been so much more.   

We also tried the poutine, tacos, and the $7 deal of 1lb chicken wings.  Everything was nothing short of average, so I would not see the benefit of coming here for the food either.  Price to portion-wise, the Happy Hour deals pale in comparison to what you could get in North York at the fried chicken joints, like Cheers outside Finch Station.  

However, I believe that one notable property of this floor is the decor.  It mixes retro with the modern, topping it all off with a snazzy light-up design of Marilyn Monroe above black-red couches.  If you're a fan of Fran's for the lower floor (like me), it's worth a try to come up here for some drinks with friends.  

In regards to its suitability for dates, it's a good choice, but maybe not for the first date.",2

I've heard about the original Vig and have been excited to know that one was coming to North Central. The reputation did not disappoint. The building is beautiful, the parking lot is full of expensive cars and the place is full of beautiful people eating, drinking and playing bocce ball. No ironic hipsters here drinking PBR, this is a place where you want to be in shape, dress up and head out for a fun night. They even have a ""Vig Rig"" to give rides to from the bar to people who've had too much to drink. I was just there to socialize so I didn't get a chance to try the food, but friends said it was good. 

Its exciting to see a new place like this in the area and nice to know that good restaurants and bars can continue to succeed and thrive in Central Phoenix.",2

This place is reminiscent of the foot massages of Asia,  and 90 min for $53 is a great bargain when compared to how much 50 minutes gets you at the Canyon Ranch or Bellagio.  Even if you factor in the cab fare you still come out ahead.   

Vivian is the manager and she was very helpful in arranging a semi private room for myself and two other friends.  The therapists were good,  really working out the knots in the shoulders and the soreness in the feet.  I would say they their firm massages do a much better job than the hotel spas by FAR.

We also got car service back to our hotel on the strip, an extra touch of service that sealed the deal for us.  We will definitely come back to Good Foot Spa every time we are in town!",2

I wanted to keep eating even though I was already full from eating the mountain of yuminess.  The lettuce is topped with their shrimp ceviche.  It's massive!  It can definitely feed two people.  It was so flavorful that I didn't even need to use the salad dressing they gave me.  There is a bit of a kick to it most likely from the onions and cilantro, but it just adds greatness to the overall flavor.  I'm kind of sad they don't have this place where I live.",2

The server encouraged me to try the red curry. My life has been forever changed!!! Every bite was every flavor perfectly fitting together. I read from one of reviews that they tend to run spicy so I went with the mild. It was just a low hint of heat that went perfectly with the creamy, savory, and slightly sweet sauce.

9144,3,1550793600000,"I decided I wanted a place in Vegas to take my girl, and get all dressed up before our show. After finally deciding on Lupo we were pretty excited. Reservations at 6:30 and we arrived a half hour early from the art gallery, they took us in 15 minutes early. Reservations are very recommended, but they do serve dinner at the bar. Our waited was very friendly, and about 4 other people also assist with drink refills, and such. The bread was crunchy, but very tasteful with a white bean sauce or olive puree. The menu was good, but their specials are nice as well. My girl ended up with pork belly and pork chop. She enjoyed the belly a lot, but the chop was a little dry and there were no vegetables or potatoes to mix flavors. I went with the special of surf n turf. The fillet was very good, the red wine sauce used was one of the best tasting I have tried. The lobster was as good as the best I have had, nothing extra. My dish came with green beans, and potatoes which were both very good. All in all our experience with the food, and staff was good, nothing over the top, but very solid. 

What I wish they would change is their seating. I hate being out in the ""balcony"" where inside a casino people come right next to your table and look at your plate. They have an extensive wine list, but sadly my girl nor I indulge, and the only other thing to drink is water. Their prices are very fair for what you get at about 35 dollars a plate, however watch their specials, and get prices. The surf and turf ended up being 95 dollars which is more than anticipated with the other prices at a third of that. 

Setting was very nice and romantic if you sit inside. They don't enforce much of a dress code either which was a let down. Definitely well organized friendly staff with nothing too special in personality, good food, but next time in Vegas I would have to try another place as it didn't set itself above the rest.",2
9149,1,1551312000000,"They're developing the Yonge Sheppard Centre and it's taking forever but some of the food court restaurants and seating areas are open yet the security guards are making the customers feel like a criminal.  
Most times I do buy my lunch at the food court yet a couple of times I bring my lunch, eat quickly to do some shopping at the shops like Winners.  But today one security guard was asking a gentleman who brought his own lunch and he had inquired why he needed to leave if there are no signs visible to just advise only ""paying customers should occupy the food court"".  
That was so rude and I felt embarrassed for the guy since another security also came ""to assist"" which created a scene for the whole food court.  
I've never heard of such a ""rule"" at any food court shopping malls so why is this ""Centre"" an exception without having visible signs.  Security has no other job there but to make a scene?  
I understand now with back to school kids occupying a whole role of table when they're not eating lunch to ask them to leave BUT if someone is eating lunch leave them alone.  So unethical and ruins a hard working individual who only has an hour lunch to be kicked out without even finishing his food.

It was, Oh So Delicious, with a remoulade sauce and creamy slaw on top.  The slaw must have had some celery in it too.  YUM!  Ordered some fries to go with it and the fries were crisp and hot.

It was Sunday at 12:20, and the singer/guitarist was so loud, it was impossible to get far enough away from speakers to be able to converse with your friends.

9210,3,1548979200000,"I like LOFT apparel because it was perfect for my previous career of fun, professional work attire. I loved their tanks and shells to wear with my suits or with cardigans. Now, I love picking up their short-sleeve tops because they are dressy and casual - I can wear them with shorts or jeans! Their cardigans and jackets are cute as well. I don't have any experience with their suits, dresses, or jeans. However, I can speak for the other items and I like their value, especially when they have their generous sales (40-50% off full-price new styles, additional discounts off sale items). The quality is good, but there's definitely room for improvement. For the prices, I don't expect too much though.

The customer service is spotty. A couple associates are very friendly and helpful, but most either don't acknowledge your presence or aren't helpful (until you have a pile of clothes in your arms). During one of my visits, the associate was on the phone while I stood at the register for five minutes without acknowledgement from anyone. While I was finally assisted by another associate, I discovered that the first associate was a manager and she continued talking about business on the phone (with another LOFT associate) while ringing up customers! It was obvious that the conversation was neither necessary or urgent and it was extremely rude to everyone. The associate helping me made it very apparent that she was also bothered by the manager's actions. Overall, not a good experience.

The reality is that I like LOFT, this location is convenient, and I usually try to mind my business so that I don't require assistance while shopping. That way, I'm a happy camper.",2

I've also had their chicken and beef kabobs and they are OK; taste wise the kabobs don't even come close to the chicken served in the Shawarma.

9276,1,1549238400000,"My girlfriend and I stayed here recently as a last minute option and were not disappointed. 

Upon entrance, the hotel is modern and chic. There's a bar, a pool and a large amount of space to lounge and relax in the lobby. They also have a food area where you can purchase coffees, snacks and frozen meals at night (breakfast options available in the AM). There aren't microwaves in the room however they do have one in the lobby. 

The room was on the smaller side however it was cozy and extremely clean. The shower comes with a dispenser of body wash and a shampoo & conditioner (the kind that's a 2-1, not a fan favorite) so I would suggest bringing your own if you are weird about hair products!  There was a hair dryer as well as a decent amount of towels, which was nice. 

The room comes with a mini fridge and a mini coffee maker. There's no in-room bar, so plan for that. We brought a bottle of wine and couldn't drink it because the front desk doesn't have bottle openers. That's one downside I found. The bed was comfortable and the shades allowed complete darkness. It was a comfortable sleep!

The location is pretty clutch. You're right near the highway that takes you pretty much anywhere you need to be. I was born and raised in North Olmsted and have to say that it's an extremely convenient area to be located.

9290,3,1549238400000,"****worst manicure ever****

If I could give this place a negative star I would. I purchased a Fox 5 groupbuy for a mani/pedi. The girl started doing my manicure and I told her EXACTLY how I like my nails done (which is pretty simple) square cut and clear polish, my nails are pretty long, and I told her I wanted them cut down (but not completely off) she started clipping my nails and I don't know if the tool was old but it wasn't comfortable and at one point I had reflexively pulled my hand back when I felt  it almost clip my skin. Meanwhile she starts filing my nails, then puts cuticle oil on them but never pushes my cuticles back but instead starts scraping across the top of all my nails, which I've never experienced before, then slaps clear on and tells me we are done. She never soaked my nails. I was so irate when I saw what she did to my nails. They have never looked so horrible. She cut all my nails off and all of them were uneven and the top of my nails now feel so rough like sandpaper from her scraping them. 

I was so appalled by this that I was too afraid to do the pedicure and I expressed this to the front desk girl, who in turn told the mgr on duty but she never came out to  even apologize or look at my nails. 

This girl should not be aloud to see clients, I'm so beyond upset, and for a mgr to not even come out and see me shows this place has poor business etiquette. Stay away from this place.",3

9312,3,1549324800000,"My fiance and I went for dinner on a Friday night a few weeks ago. I was SO pissed off after the experience that I figured I'd wait awhile to write a review. I had a $25 restaurant.com gift certificate.  The terms on the certificate stated that you had to spend $35 minimum, alcohol not included, and that an 18% gratuity would be added to the pre-coupon total. Fine with me - I'm used to those terms on these types of certificates. 

We were greeted by an older gentleman who was pretty friendly and joked with us about where we wanted to sit. We were then waited on by another guy (possibly an owner or manager? he was loud and somewhat obnoxious). He tried to get us to order wine, but I've been having headaches from wine recently, so we passed, even though he was pushy about it (which is weird - lots of people don't drink at all, for religious or health reasons, so I don't understand trying to force a customer to order alcohol). 

We ordered a 2-cheese plate, and asked for the house-made mozzarella and the ""dried cow's milk cheese."" We were given the supposedly house-made mozzarella and the smoked mozzarella, which was disappointing because I don't like smoked cheeses at all.  I decided not to say anything because my fiance likes smoked cheese, so I figured he could enjoy it.  The ""house-made mozzarella"" was a misnomer - I have had better ""fresh"" mozzarella from the grocery store. The roasted veggies were pretty good. 

Next, we ordered a Prosciutto Pizza and a mixed-greens salad. The salad was really good, the dressing was a balsamic vinaigrette and it was crisp and refreshing.  The pizza was good as well - full of flavor and piping hot.  The crust was a little soggy, but that doesn't bother me at all. We were full after the cheese and veggies and salad, so we asked to take half the pizza to go. 

The waiter brought our bill, and we gave him our restaurant.com certificate.  He immediately, and very rudely, said that we couldn't use it, even though our pre-tax bill totalled more than $40, and the certificate said we had to order $35 worth of food. I told him that we had complied with the terms that were on the certificate. He said that to use the certificate we needed to order 2 entrees. I told him that the certificate didn't say that, and that it just said our bill needed to be more than $35, which it was.  He repeated that the ""terms of the certificate"" required us to order 2 entrees, and said the certificate is designed ""so that people will order two entrees and wine and order more food."" I pointed out the fact that the certificate specifically states that alcohol is excluded, and he still tried to fight me on it, but finally relented and said he would go ahead and do it ""this time."" (Of course, after his rudeness, I'm not sure why he expected there would be a next time). He took my certificate, calculated the final bill, and brought it back to us - you could tell he was totally pissed at us at this point. He then sent someone else out to pick up our payment and to box up my pizza. He added a 20% gratuity to the bill (which was totally fine - we knew we were getting a good deal by using the certificate). After we paid, we left and will never return. The pizza was decent enough, but wouldn't be worth paying full price, and I would never attempt to use a coupon there again, only to risk being treated rudely. If the restaurant doesn't want to honor those types of certificates, they shouldn't sign up for them. Or, alternatively, they should place more restrictions or additional terms on the deal, and stick to the terms printed on the deal. They could easily require a minimum of $50 to be spent (lots of other restaurant.com restaurants do). 

Bottom line - we will never go back, and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.  I awarded 2 stars simply because the food was decent.",1

9349,2,1550275200000,"Ryan's has the look and feel of the neighborhood bar we all long for, that TV has told us we can have. A place where everyone knows your name and just might feature heavily when you one day tell your kids how you met their mother. Unfortunately, it falls a little below those standards. But it isn't bad. 

Moving into the neighborhood I was excited to have an Irish Pub nearby. My strong British roots give me a love for Guinness, stew, corned beef and cabbage. I envisioned a place with good cheap beer where my friends and I could spend many a night, but the place just doesn't draw me back to it. 

The beers are overpriced for the atmosphere (and the selection) and the food is nothing great. Their kitchen is open later than most, and the food certainly isn't bad, so if you want something fried up at midnight, I'd actually recommend it. Along with some Lipitor. But for the drink prices, you might as well go down the street to D's where the selection is 100-fold and the food is more original. 

The bar is large, and that is nice. I always seem to be able to get a stool if we want them, and there is a dartboard in the back (thought it's a little awkwardly placed near the restroom). 

They also do a pretty good trivia night. That is worth checking out if you and your friends have a ton of useless knowledge like I do. 

They have an outdoor smoking section in the summer and has closed windows in the cooler months. 

TVs are ok, but not very big at the bar. In the seating area there is a big old-school rear-projection TV (the kind that was a ""big-screen"" in 1990) and they will play games on that. No HD on that one though.

So, decent food that isn't anything special and beer that is a little pricer than it needs to be are the reasons I won't give this a 4-star rating. But it's not a bad little place in the end.",1

9444,1,1549065600000,"My social foodie group and I decided to try out Kozu, an Asian-inspired bar-restaurant on Plateau Mont-Royal on Friday which opened this past summer by the same group behind Mayfair, Kampai, Fitzroy, and Flyjin (none of which impressed). What actually attracted me to this spot was the chef; Olivier Vigneault is also chef at Jatoba, this Asian-inspired eatery in the heart of downtown whose menu never disappointed me.

Starting off, we tried various cocktails; I ordered the Kung Fu Panda to start, made with rum, brandy, cinnamon and anise syrup, lime and egg white, and followed with the Malacca Sour, made with scotch, five spice, lime and egg white. The cocktails, much like their names, were fun, flavorful and not too strong, so overall great!

As for the food, we decided to go with the group menu which included a variety of dishes from edamame, to dumplings, papaya salad, salmon poke bowl, to chicken bao buns; over 12 dishes (if my memory serves well after those cocktails) for almost 45$ and it was well worth the price. Besides a BBQ pork dish which I found a little tough, the rest of the dishes were nicely executed, flavorful and just plain delicious. The portions of those sharing plates, may I add, were very generous and left us more than satisfied. Even though we were full, we couldn't resist trying the desserts; I opted for the praline and chocolate cake which was just stupendous!  

Kudos to this place for the service which was quick and attentive; we had two members with dietary restrictions dining with us and the multitude of staff serving us were all aware and kindly explained all dishes while being served, and pointed out the ones that of our guests couldn't have; they even changed up the menu for us offer more vegetarian dishes and seafood options for the same price.

The space was very modern and chic with dark tones, marble, oak, black leather banquettes and a beautiful long bar while the ambience was festive and young; so very elegant but more relaxed than the classier Jatoba.

In all, I loved the high-end and modern cuisine, the beautifully decorated space, the friendly and efficient service and of course, the yummy cocktails. I would totally return to Kozu!",2

9469,2,1550534400000,"The Flamingo has been a mainstay in Las Vegas for as long as you can remember. Old Blue Eyes frequented this joint often with his Rat Pack and you can really tell age hasn't always been the kindest to the interior and design of this heirloom hotel & casino. However, if you can look past the cheesiness of some of the decorum and look more into the amenities this place has to provide, you'll see this is still one of the best budget hotels to stay in Vegas.

Exterior/Interior - 2 stars

The glitz and glam of a former era still speaks loudly at the Flamingo. The tacky designs of aged light bulbs and over-the-top glitz just doesn't fit well with the ultra sleek and clean look of modern Las Vegas hotels. Walking outside and the facade hasn't aged well; walking inside and it's old school, and not in a good way. If all hotels & casinos were based off face value, the Flamingo would be the unpopular kid getting hit in the head with dodge-balls. Luckily, the Flamingo is more than looks.

Room - 4 stars

Walking through the casino floor you would expect the same tackiness to fill up the rooms of the hotel but the Flamingo did an excellent job of renovating their rooms. Dark stained laminate looking somewhat like wood is your floor. The rooms are spacious enough where you can easily fit in a party of 6 or 8 people comfortably. The water pressure in the shower is excellent and hot water is available within seconds. And most importantly, these rooms have some of the most excellent views out onto the Strip. When you see the gold of sunset slowly drip onto the Strip and neon lights bring the city to life, you fall mesmerized by that window view. It was my nightlight to sleep and captivated me more than anything I could find on TV.

Yet, there are downsides to this room. The laminate isn't exactly smooth all around. The lamps in the bathroom are rusty. The vent was crooked in the bathroom and the TV was way too small for the size of the furniture. Still, other than some minor things you honestly couldn't ask for more in a room.

Amenities - 3 stars

I'm going to include location into this part as well. If this entire section alone was based off location it would be 5 stars. The Flamingo is located right in the heart of the Strip (or at least where it matters). You are right across from Caesar's Palace, side-by-side with The Linq and The Cromwell and you can walk all the way to Wynn or the Cosmopolitan within 10 - 15 minutes. It really is a fantastic location; however, location isn't the only factor. As far as in house things like gym or just the casino itself, you'll find yourself drifting to other locations. Why stay and gamble at the Flamingo when you have much nicer casino floors 100 feet away? The gym itself is nothing more than a small room about the size of a store. In fact, it is squeezed right between a lingerie store and jeweler and since there are no doors for privacy if you're doing those incredible effective glute exercises, anyone walking by can see you sweating. Still, the Flamingo does have some cool amenities like seeing their flamingos out in the garden, exotic birds for show and tell near the buffet, and Center Cut is still one of the best steakhouses on the Strip, a hidden gem really.

Conclusion

In a time where EDM, day clubs, and the Buffet of Buffets exists, the Flamingo can feel like a remnant of the past. Still, with excellent location, gorgeous views of the Strip from your room, affordable prices, and a great steakhouse, as long as the Flamingo can continue to improve itself this hotel & casino ain't going nowhere.",3

9497,1,1549929600000,"We dined at this restaurant on 9/04/2016 AD.

I would recommend coming to this restaurant after sunset; the ambiance transforms into a more elegant place. The ambiance changes so radically because, the windows of the restaurant don't have any tint, so it feels like you are eating at a brightly lit park. This sort of kills it for me when planning a, ""date night"" - the key word being, ""night"". After sunset the accent lighting of the restaurant becomes the primary light source and changes the mood entirely.

The establishment was clean, well decorated and the service was efficient and friendly. They don't serve any alcohol so be sure to have a cocktail or other adult beverage prior to arriving. The menu as of this review, is only one page, which helps to keep it simple and highlight the best dishes. The food was delicious, the prices were fair and the portions were decent.

I highly recommend this restaurant for lunch or dinner. If you want the maximum experience for, ""date night"", then arrive after the sun has set.",3
9501,3,1551225600000,"OK come on now, you know what you are getting here. 

There is going to be a moment where the entire grill is engulfed in flames and the patrons around the table ""ooh"" and ""aahh"" 

Something is going to get hurled at you from a stainless steel spatula while everyone watches you attempt to catch it in your mouth (broccoli and yes I caught it). 

There's going to be a volcano made of onion. 

Lastly, there is a lot of commentary, singing, slapping of utensils and shenanigans. 

Generally there is also some decent food - I usually opt for the scallops and steak. Veggies, rice, noodles and meat are cooked well. 

My 4 star rating is based on a few factors: First of all the ambiance inside Wasabi is very pretty with lots of low light and walls that glow blue. The waitress was very attentive and there was nothing to complain about regarding the food. 

The biggest factor in my 4 star rating was watching the ""show"" though the eyes of my 7 year old niece. She chose Wasabi for her bday dinner (seriously when I was 7 I thought Olive Garden was where rich people ate, what is wrong with this generation?) She loved the attention she got from the cook because it was her birthday. She reminded me that there is a time and place for everything and Wasabi delivers on the hibachi show boatin' promise with good service, tasty food and a comfortable ambiance.",2

I showed my colleagues and they all verified that it was glass as well. The staff, however, took the glass from me and kept saying ""it's not glass, it's tempura bits. We fry them many times so they're very crunchy"". I told them tempura bits don't crack teeth, they're not clear and they don't glisten in the light.

She then grabbed one of the shrimp tempura of ours off the table to try and compare it to the glass, and so I picked up a piece of tempura bit and showed her how I can crush it between my fingers...I asked her to do that with the glass. I took it from her and almost cut myself trying.

She then saw the glisten that we were talking about and said she would show the chefs...NO apology!!! For the next 30 minutes, we were COMPLETELY ignored. We tried getting the attention of FOUR staff members for the bill when they passed our table, but they just kept walking.

Long story short, we got our bill with NO discount, and I politely asked if there was compensation for the glass that I bit into. They took it away and gave me a 10% discount...you know, the discount Asian restaurants normally give people paying with cash!?

They also said it was a salmon bone...a salmon bone!? It was a roll with only tempura bits and spicy mayo!!!! And a salmon bone isn't completely transparent, isn't as hard as a rock and doesn't refract light! I didn't make a scene at that point. I merely paid my bill with no tip, but I will NEVER eat there again after this incident that I was called a liar for.

I work at a large company close to this building and went there frequently with my colleagues. I will now be sharing my experience with those colleagues as well and we will eat at another all you can eat sushi restaurant that's close by.

Guess what I found in my bowl of curry noodles? Daun salam. A bay leaf relative - but more anisey, bitier, different. An awesome, strange nuance I always stick in my curry laksa but not to be found at our only other Malaysian joint. Made my little day, seeing that leaf, all scenting my curry with odd, tasty flava.

Roti was good, if standard. Hainanese rice on the burner here, but veggies beware - chicken stock abounds. 

Service was comfy and attendant. If I lived closer, I'd be here regularly, but even leaves of Salam won't get my belly to agree to a 30 minute drive when the craving for curry hits...alas.",2

MAUI DOG IS CLOSING ON DECEMBER 29th.

I had lunch here today and the owner passed along the news.  Landlord is hiking rent and he never made a profit so can't aford to stay and is out of the cash needed to move locations.

A sad day for Phoenix.

I have to say, SHAME on myself and the rest of the Phoenix foodies and Yelpers out there.  We all love this place, so why don't we go?  I work 2 miles from here and have only been three times.  AND I LOVE IT.  I've told people to go.  THEY love it.

Alas...  Two weeks from today...  no more Maui Dog.

Thanks to the owner for his pride and guts with this delicious concept.  I hope to see you pop up again somewhere in the valley.  If you do, I vow to be more supportive.

The poor girl at the counter probably had to go through the flavors with me (and my indecisiveness) a few times, but ultimately I decided upon:
Triple Vanilla; Triple Chocolate; Strawberry; Triple Berry Custard; and Cheesecake.  The cupcakes were moist and amazingly delicious! My favorite was the chocolate and the vanilla. They were not overly sweet.  My suggestion - create a marble cupcake (half chocolate and half vanilla).  I would be happy to taste test it for you.

I think you need to create a frequent buyer program.

The Triple Berry was everyone's least favorite cupcake. I probably wouldn't get that again. My only complaint was that the girl at the counter helping me used her hands to get the cupcakes out of the display case.  Please start using a utensil!!!! Or, at least gloves.",3

9614,2,1550707200000,"Interesting place... I kind of like how it was decorated inside.  A little erratic maybe... LOTS of TV screens for sports watching, sports memorabilia on the walls and ceilings, misogynistic posters and plates, and let's not forget the spinning female mannequins in skimpy lingerie.  There was one that I swear was staring right at me, watching me the entire time.   

The service is ok.  The guys who work here definitely DGAF but I think that's part of their charm.  Think Dick's Last Resort and grumpy codgers.  However, they do remember your order (even from yesterday) and bring it to you on the double.

The drinks themselves aren't that great but let's be honest I wasn't expecting this to be a craft cocktail experience.  They get the job done for sure, especially the ones with the 151 float.  They don't even pour your beer out of the can for you but they do pop the top so there's that.  

The games here are fun and you do get tokens with your drink orders.  Some of them take way too many tokens to play but those ones you usually get more tickets for.  Example, the pool table is 4 tokens and the pinball machine is 1 and we got 2 and 1 tickets from these, respectively.  The beer pong is 6 tokens but we got at least 20 tickets each time we played.  So if you want the shiny beads from your favorite sports team, you'll have to shell out those tokens!!!

I will say the cash only aspect is annoying, especially when you are looking at the cash register and the card reader is in plain site.",2

I usually have to clip a few stray hairs myself when I get home, but not this time. I also saw a few other customers with the other barbers and was impressed with all the cuts coming out of there.

9635,2,1550793600000,"This is a nice hotel, a little out of the way from where things are happening in Montreal, but you can get it for a pretty good price.  The rooms are pretty spacious and clean and our corner room had wall-to-wall windows on two sides.  There's also a decent restaurant attached, and they offer free visits to the Contemporary Art Museum and Architecture Museum, just by displaying your room keycard.

The worst things about this hotel: the elevator is god-awful slow and tiny.  How slow and tiny?  I promise you, ever time you ride the elevator, you will know the names of the other people you are riding with.  Guaranteed.  Even if you don't speak French.

While we were here, they had an art exhibition, featuring the artist.  I really liked that they were so involved in art, from the museum passes to the rotating display in the gallery.  However, the art was of the abstact expressionist variety.  You know, brushstrokes that to the untrained eye look like they could have been painted by a toddler or elephant?  That kind.  So not exactly my taste, but they did offer free wine tasting, so they won me over.",2
9635,3,1550534400000,"I think the Arts Fest has been improving in the last couple years. I like that they're constantly striving to make improvements and keep up with the times. There are two reasons I specifically wanted to update my review.  

One reason is that I felt they're trying to make an effort to include local artists who are affordable. I was happy to see Strawberryluna there (if you don't know who you are, google them quickly!), who are at a lot of the I Made It Markets around town. But I also bought something from another artist from Ohio that also had fairly priced prints. I was super excited that I made not one, but two purchases this year!

Second, I loved the beer garden along the Wyndham Hotel. Brilliant idea! Even better... throw Penn Brewery into the mix! I loved being able to stop in before a free concert and enjoy a little adult bevvie that wasn't that sugary sweet lemonade. My only hope is that they continue and expand this!

I will also note that I really enjoyed that they brought some current acts like Edward Sharpe and Airborne Toxic in. I believe the past two years no one of interest to me had come. This is purely selfish though, because I know they have to include a wide variety of acts to please everyone. But I thoroughly enjoyed the modern rock/indie bands!

Plus, who can forget the epic moment when the fountain turned on for the first time in years!?

Keep evolving Arts Fest and maybe we can get you back to a full 3 weeks again!",3

We ordered mixed fried rice, peppered beef steak and mixed veggies in garlic sauce. Everything was made to order so it came out piping hot. From where I was sitting I could see the chef prepare the order too lol. 

Everything tasted delicious and as others said, portions were generous. One thing that caught us by surprised was the peppered beef steak. We were both expecting sliced beef stir fried but it was actually two steaks that were flattened with a meat tenderizer and stir fried. It tasted good but it was a bit tough and chewy.

The chef comes up to the table with the cart and cuts the beef right in front of you.

While the food server is making my Philly sandwich with gloves on he turns around and grabs a mop and starts mopping the floor then goes back to making my sandwich. 
Just because you have gloves on doesn't mean you're okay with making peoples food after touching a mop. I just didn't eat the bread he had touched with the same gloves he touch the mop with.
The employees need to be retrained on food handling skills. 
I also asked a very simple question 
""does the sandwich come with fries"" the food server said yes. I get up to the cash register and she charges me for them.
I ask her she says no they're extra.
I guess they need to listening skills as well.

She was smart and parked in the back; I followed my GPS and parked in the front, which made it a little tricky to find since it's not well-marked at all from that side. If you're looking at Stagioni on the left, go to the door on the right. We got there around 4:30, and we were the first ones there, so we grabbed a seat at the bar. Unfortunately it was way too hot to sit on the patio, but it looked pretty awesome out there.

We grabbed some drinks ($5 draft for her - Tuesday special, $9 sangria for me) and started with the I Am McLovin' queso and chips. For dinner, I got a It Was the Dukes taco and a Long Duck Dong taco. All the food and my sangria were fine, but nothing was outstanding. However, the ambiance and service were stellar. It was odd to be at a fun, Mexican restaurant with movie names on the menu when the restaurant is so pretty, but we went with it!

9652,2,1550016000000,"As an Indian person, it is hard for me to visit well-regarded Indian restaurants. My hopes are always high, and they are generally dashed to pieces within moments of receiving the first plate of food.

Not so with Copper. I came for Queen's Feast and was generally pleased with my first two courses. The chutney prawns were actually shrimp (which I prefer -- king prawns terrify me), and they were well-cooked and tasty. The tarkari gosht lamb was flavorful, albeit overcooked. I tried my husband's dishes and liked the flavor of them, too. 

But things went downhill when it came to dinner. They had two options: chocolate cake or mango mousse. The mango mousse was yummy and had a great texture. The chocolate cake was terrible. It ruined my meal. It was dense and flavorless and reminded me of some poorly mass-produced dessert you buy at a department store half off the day after Christmas. I genuinely couldn't eat it (which is saying something: I eat all kinds of chocolate, and I eat it all day -- it is 11:00 AM and I have already had it twice today). I felt like it was a waste of money and a sad end to my meal. 

Also, I thought the portions were a little small for the price, and I think they could afford to give you a freebie or two to make the meal more complete or enjoyable. I'm talking about a small bowl of namkeen (salty snacks), papadum, some mango pickle, or a small side of raita with spicy dishes -- nothing huge, but the kind of thing I'd get if I were at home. Without those little touches, an Indian meal doesn't feel complete to me. And sure, some restaurants offer this kind of thing for a small fee, but nickel-and-diming your customers at an upscale restaurant isn't the way to lure people back for another visit.",2

They look great on with a pair of high heels and I am so glad we found this place.  We were killing time waiting four our brunch joint to open.  My friend bought a couple of very different pieces.  For all of the unique and unusual pieces in this store I feel like the prices for all of these pieces were really reasonable.  This is not the Gap or Old Navy.

They specialize in noodles, so if you're looking for sushi don't come to Muku's. You can go next door to Globefish if you want sushi, they actually unofficially share a parking lot between them. Muku also has a few appy's like takoyaki (they sorta resemble a timbit witha small piece of octopus inside). Takoyaki is actually deepfried with I think a buckwheat flour and then sprinkled with fishflakes and tonkatsu sauce. You can also order the noodles in a combination with a salad. The portions are decent, not huge but you won't walk out feeling that you got ripped off or you didn;t get your moneys worth. I hate it when you leave a restaurant and you fell overstuffed too. At the end of the meal my kids always look forward to getting a sucker. One of the few place that gives kids a sucker, instead of a mint most people leave behind in the bill tray.",2

There is no added fee for up to two pets and they're very welcoming; but the presence of pets is noticeable with hairy stairwells, barking, and scratched furniture.

I wasn't a huge fan of their chicken wings. It was a pound of really small wings so it felt like most of the weight was from the bone. There was also a rule that you can't share 1 pound wings...i don't think there should be rules on how to eat your food. It's not like it was all you can eat. The nachos was okay but I felt like it was a bit overpriced for what we got. Their pulled pork grilled cheese was good though. Not sure if I will revisit to try other things on the menu.,2

The workers are always so pleasant and funny, I feel like such a regular now. Their tacos, enchiladas, and tamales are great! Also their mex-mex rice and beans are delicious. It is a great location on Mill and when you're done eating you can walk upstairs to Vintage or across the street to the Vine, Rula Bula, or Moonshine.

The soda machine was out of CO2 today. The Mexican music was so loud you couldn't hear the TVs. Then a musician came and the noise level increased by 10. So much for a quiet dinner.

Special Beef Noodle Soup (4/5): Broth was good, I didn't need to add any hoisin sauce. Beef was also delicious. Nothing to complain about here, just your standard Vietnamese noodle soup.
Sour Sop Milkshake (5/5): Amazing, I loved it. Having never eaten sour sop before, I ordered it just to say I'd tried it, but I ended up with possibly an all-time favourite.

The service: 
Basically nonexistent: You call them to hand in you order, and you walk yourself to the cash to pay.

The atmosphere: 
Good enough, the tables are nicely spaced for adequate privacy and it wasn't too loud.

Burgers are made to order, you tell them what you want... not what you don't and prices are reasonable. I would recommend ordering a double for a nominal price increase for bigger appetites The shakes are legendary and each one is worth a try.

I do not understand how this service center is getting 5 star reviews. This was literally the worst experience of my life. I trusted this shop to fix my car and I even spent the majority of my savings in order to get my car fixed... OBVIOUSLY, it still isn't fixed. Every time I called to check up on my car, the mechanic would be rude and make excuses as to why he could not give me an update, but would offer to call me back. He made me feel like I was bothering him and that he did not give a damn about my service. I gave my phone at least ten times and never once did I get a call back. Apparently, it was an inconvenience to them to return calls to their customers. It was very frustrating as you can imagine. Finally, after over 30 days of constant calling, my car was ""fixed"". The mechanic had NO PROBLEM acting nice to me in person or accepting my hard earned cash. He told me that everything was fixed and that I won't be having any problems. I drove my car home that afternoon and I noticed it made a crackling noise. I called multiple times, but did not get anyone to answer. I did not drive the car often. I drove it approximately 8-14 days since I got it from the shop. It has been three months since then. The car is having the SAME problems. The only thing this shop is good at is taking money. People always say ""never trust a mechanic"". This shop gets a 5/5 stars on this phrase. The only reason I gave it one star is because it won't allow me to give it 0. Beware.",2

The sweetbread was also highly recommended, which was too rich and soaked in oil. It was described as a cross between chicken and pork, and after trying sweetbread, chicken and pork is a rather gross combination.

9782,1,1549756800000,"Last month, I adopted the cutest little puppy ever. However, under that cute puppy face lies a devious and stubborn little puppy soul. So, a few days after bringing baby Penny home, I enrolled us in Puppy Manners class through Puppy People, which holds their classes in the back of Petopia.

The teacher, Kathy, was super friendly, very patient, and pretty knowledgeable about dogs. The teaching methods were all about positive reinforcement, and they totally work. The class itself was alright but a little too small (only 2 other pups other than mine) to get a lot of socialization in. However, Penny did learn quite a bit in class and she graduated with a nice set of puppy manners. Good dog! :)

Now, for the bad part: the smell in the training/dog daycare/boarding area is extremely ripe. Super Stinky with a capital S. Also, there were biting flies every single time we were in there. Not cool. I've used similarly-sized dog daycare and training facilities before (though that was back home in Seattle), and although places like these always kinda smell, the smell at Petopia is the worst I've ever experienced. Although the area was pretty tidy, the smell certainly keeps me from wanting to enroll in another obedience course there. 

Outside of the training bit, Petopia has a pretty decently sized stock of pet toys, food, and treats. I'd probably visit again if I were in the area.",2

- The drinks are strong and reasonably priced.
- The music is always good, definitely a mixture - plus a jukebox you can play.
- The crowd is mostly younger, lively and a good time.
- The brunch here is a good price and just about anything you could want - they have a DJ who spins good music and remixes - the selling point being pitchers of incredible mimosas!

9906,2,1550448000000,"Gonna make this review easy for both me and you.

PROS
- Affordable lunch and dinner specials. Check out their Hakka Style (family) dinners  that work out to be about $12/person.
- Flavorful spicy HOT food.
- Friendly waitress with a sweet smile that keeps your water glass full.
- Large space with high ceilings and lots of elbow room to enjoy your food: smallest table seats 4. They even have a private party room in the back.
- Open 7 days a week and holidays from 12noon-10pm.
- Free WiFi.
- Hot & Spicy Shrimp was flavorful and crispy on the outside. Decent sized bouncy shrimp. The fried rice that came with it was spicier.

CONS
- Layers of plastic table cloths on the table and fake plastic plants. Yeah, the decor leaves much to be desired.
- Fish Pakora was mostly batter with a little bit of fish, spice level HOT! Served with a dip that tastes like a sweet thousand island dressing.

Obviously the pros outweigh the cons here. Happy eating!",2

9918,1,1550793600000,I had a very pleasant service by our waitress . she had a lovely smile and was very helpful I will truly come again and hope that Karla is our waiter. The food was delicious and the environment was very calm,2

The customer service here is top notch. Questions were answered in detailed and I never felt pressure to buy out of my budget. I left with two beautiful rings that my fiancee and I are thrilled with. I would absolutely come back.",2
9920,2,1548979200000,"Definitely a great place to back and back again. I stumble upon this place while visiting family in Ohio and they knew of this great Mexican restaurant to get amazing tacos. Since I love tacos, my lady and I decided to go. The place is nice and spacious an definitely crowded (of course) due to it popularity. The way to order, one gets a sheet with different styles of making your own tacos. After you select what you want, you give it to your waiter and behold, delicious tacos. The tacos are amazing, juicy and flavorful. Overall, next time we go to Cleveland, Barrio is going to be our stop to eat.",2
9926,1,1550275200000,"Horrible!!! The location is very strange, tucked away in the corner of a shopping mall that nothing is near. Half ass sign, the only reason I knew I had the correct location was all the cars outside. I have never seen more security at any other show! These people search you top to bottom and even have a metal detector wand! The only thing that was nice was the sound.
The mixed drinks were nasty and I have never sweated so much! They have no air conditioning! I hate this place!",2
9926,2,1550620800000,Good food but subpar service. We got the veg combo and it was delicious. Bread was soft and the curries was well cooked. But the service was slow even though no one was at the restaurant. The staff tried to engage us but ended up coming across a little abrasive.,2
9934,2,1549411200000,"I was going Gangnam Style. 

Actually, our chef was going Gangnam Style, singing the song and waving his knives around.  These guys not only embrace cultural jokes, but run with them (in a good way).

We went to Tomo after getting a Groupon and no, we didn't make reservations.  It wasn't a problem, we sat at the bar for about 10 minutes and were able to be sat at one of the ""entertainment"" seats.  

The bartender, bless her soul, was probably hired on her looks instead of her apt bartending abilities.  First they were out of ginger beer (gasp!), but the drinks she made were fine.  It just took forever to get them and then to close out our tab when we moved to a table.

As for the hibachi, no complaints here!  Our chefs were Beninhana styled jokesters.  Keeping us laughing and engaged from soup to Hibachi.  It probably didn't hurt that they were shooting saki in our mouths the whole time either!  

The food seemed fresh and was diced and tossed and played with great skill!  We got the chicken and shrimp as well as the Tomo Special (ahem, thanks to my boyfriend who always orders the most expensive thing on the menu when I'm paying!).  It was all great!  I'd probably skip the chicken, just because the shrimp was to die for, and holy moly was that lobster and steak good ( I did at least get a taste).  Their secret mayo/pink sauce, I couldn't get enough of it either!  

So even though our bill wasn't cheap, we had a great time!  I want to come back and bring a big group because the Saki fights were getting pretty intense - but I""m sure my friends could keep the game up!",2
9935,2,1551052800000,"I checked out this place with a Groupon deal, and boy am I glad that I didn't pay full price! For a place called Biscuits you'd think that their biscuits would be superb, right? Sorry, that's not the case here. Their biscuits tasted like they were baked several days ago and were microwaved. They were dry and hard on the bottom.

I ordered a hotdog, which was on a bun that I think I've purchased at the grocery store... y'know, the kind you get in an 8-ct package for $0.99. The fries tasted like they were frozen. 

My friend ordered the southern style chicken strips. He figured they'd be really good since they were $9 and were listed as a house specialty. Sorry, but it seems like these were frozen, too, and the fries were the same ones I got.

To top off the whole experience, the waitress was snippy and didn't want to take our Groupons. They said one per person and she was convinced that they should be one per table. 

TL/DR version:
Overpriced food for what I can get at Walmart and fry at home or pick up for half the cost at McDonald's.",2
9941,1,1551139200000,"I've been here several times and my recent time was February 28th for the Alan Jackson Anniversary Tour.  I bought tickets online and my main concern was whether the seats I was getting would be close enough to the stage to actually see AJ to make purchasing seats worth it.  I scoured the internet for pictures to see if there was anyway to know what the view was like from seats in row QQ seats 4 and 3.  I really didn't have a clue.  The crazy thing is that seats more towards the middle were about $20 more bringing the price from $45 to $69ish.  Not worth it to me.  They also had seats directly in front of the stage, standing room only for cheaper.  If it were only me I would have done it but for my mom who is in her late 50s, no.  Anyway, the seats were on the end of the row and the view was stage right and was decent.  A little closer and I could have seen his face clearly (5 rows down probably).  Thank goodness for the screens on the left and right of the stage my view was enjoyable.  At one point in the show there was a special photo video, center stage and we couldn't see it from where we were.  Boo!  It also sprinkled and we just missed the cover so for like an hour we endured a slight sprinkle (for anyone new to the area, the venue is all outdoors).  My advice, if there is any chance of rain bring some sort of cover.  The sprinkling eventually stopped and all was well again although it was a slight annoyance.  
Of great importance I should mention the sound.  It's great!  I've never had a problem.
One thing I enjoy about this venue is the ability to move around.  There is the large courtyard floor for food and drink and concert memorabilia.  We met up with others that we attended the show with but bought our tickets separately so it was nice to catch up with them there.  Bathrooms are large so you don't have to wait in line long and staff is friendly.   If you are there to enjoy music with friends and don't want to be limited to seating I'd say go grass lawn.  You can bring blankets, lawn chairs but be prepared to interact with rowdies sometimes (never had any issues, just wanted all to know they're around), have to arrive early for better seats and be prepared for people who are not afraid to crowd you out of your spot to get closer to you for better views.  And don't forget about smokers, of all kind.
 All in all I like this venue.  It really depends what kind of experience you are looking for but I'm convinced you can get what you want depending how much you're willing to spend.",1

J'aime bien les couloirs divisés par vitesse (lent, moyen, rapide et très rapide). Ça évite de perdre le beat, de foncer dans quelqu'un ou de te faire chatouiller les orteils parce que ton prochain est trop rapide.

Le service d'accueil est toujours sympathique et courtois et les prix sont raisonnables: 2$ l'entrée avec l'achat d'une carte de 20 entrées, 3$ l'entrée pour les résidents de Lasalle et 4$ l'entrée pour un adulte régulier.

Il y a 3 bassins intérieurs, enfants avec glissoires, bassin peu profond de 25m (couloirs), bassin profond avec tremplins.

Les deux aspects plus négatifs selon moi:
- les heures d'ouvertures pour le bain libre. Bon, il y a 4 plages horaires (avantage: pas trop d'achalandage), mais celles de 55 minutes sont selon moi insuffisantes.
- plus souvent qu'autrement, les vestiaires sont moyennement propres. Il y a certainement une lacune à ce niveau.

I personally have not had the ""talking down to"" treatment that my husband has encountered the last 2 times he has taken his vehicle there; but I cannot understand why the staff seems to have taken a 180 in the last 2-3 years and now the service is sub-par. 
Its too bad because I used to swear I had the best mechanics in the state...but when I see the  reviews over the past year on here I see I am not the only one who has found issues with the service and the way they are treating people.
For the cost of what they charge you would think they would treat people with decency, but they must be making enough enough money to lose clients.
I agree with Elyse R., I wonder how many thousands I could have saved if I had only gone to an honest shop with decent employees. Time to find out!",1
9964,1,1550966400000,I had the seared scallops. They were cooked well but the seasoning was way too strong and overpowered the dish.

If you do get take out they really package everything nicely.

The only thing I haven't liked so far is the Signature Fresh Rolls, they're huge but really loosely wrapped and really bland.  Total bummer!  I would steer clear of them but the rest is definitely worth a try.",2

I can't even find what we ordered to suggest - but we had fresh BUFFALO MOZZARELLA, which was kneaded and placed in ice water - topped with a few different toppings of your choice, the taste was fresh and divine.  Watich the hot water knead my mozzarella wasn't bad either.

Price: Bites and Brews is about average pricing, not cheap, but the food is so good that you feel good about what you've paid for, most draft beers are $5 and for one extra dollar you can upgrade to a 20 oz.

Drinks: extensive list of unique and seasonal draft beers, full bar, many bottles to choose from

Atmosphere: huge televisions to watch sporting events, TouchTones, dart board, outdoor seating, a long bar, bar-type seating behind the bar, big tables for groups

Service: very friendly service, even when they were very busy we were served promptly and courteously, bartenders are nice and mix good drinks

(+): good location on Ellsworth Ave. next to other bars, great bar-type food (especially the pizza), many beers to choose from, great service, good atmosphere

(-): store hours aren't favorable, not open during lunch hours any day of the week when one of their sandwiches and salads would taste great

That sense of relief was all thanks to Andra and I am happy he was able to help me today! 

The cashier/ cashier experience left a bit to be desired. I asked her to call a store manager over so I could compliment Andra and she said he was just over there and I could walk to him. I had to ask her again to have him come over. Someone finally did but he did not seem to care? (Part of the reason I'm writing this is to ensure that Andra gets the proper accolades because I don't think I actually spoke to a manager.) Also, the credit card reader was broken this day so she asked me if I could pay with cash which I could not. She wasn't rude but I could tell she was irritated that she had to do extra work (writing down the items I purchased individually and taking my credit card info).

Mind you, I was at Wet Republic at MGM Grand the day before so this pool had A LOT to love up to.  I found a travelzoo deal for $20 (good for a value UP TO $60).  This pool is at the Palazzo, which is a horrendous hotel in itself.  We had a a box of cupcakes (whom my friend swears up and down is NOT really food) to take w/ us to the pool, but the check-in girl downstairs said that they didn't allow people to bring food to the pool, so we'd have to eat it now, leave it w/ her or leave it w/ someone AT THE POOL.  We were a little irritated but we didn't want to scarf the cupcakes down right then and there, so we decided to bring them w/ us and leave them w/ the attendant by the pool.  First of all, the weather was gloomy but ONLY at the Palazzo, so that should tell you something right then and there.  We stand in line and get our hands stamped after our IDs are looked at.  We get to the front of the line and we are informed that we cannot bring food to the pool.  My friend replied, ""First of all.  They're cupcakes; it's not food.  But the lady downstairs told us we can leave them w/ you until we're done w/ the pool.""  He told us that we couldn't leave our cupcakes with him.  When we told him that the lady downstairs who was checking in people for Azure said that we could, he replied, ""Well she doesn't work here.""  Well, actually, yes she does, you dumb f#ck.  Why else would she be standing there?  UNDER THE AZURE SIGN.  So we keep pressing him, saying that we were told we could leave the cupcakes up there.  He responds, ""Whaddya want me to do?  There are 50 people behind you waiting.""  So pissed and agitated, we got out of line, debating whether or not to go in since we've already had it up to here w/ Azure AND The Palazzo.  We decide to hurriedly eat our pretty, fanciful decorated cupcakes and head back.  And wouldn't you know, even w/ our hands stamped, we had to get in line and wait.  Again.  We approach Mr. Douche once again and he asked us how our cupcakes were.  WTF?!  F#ck you!  And just a side note:  he looks like his name would be Hanz.  Anyway, we finally get to Azure and it is totally.....NOT WORTH IT.  AT ALL.  First of all, in order to have a chair, you MUST reserve one.  This was never mentioned on our Travelzoo ticket.  And the pools?  Oh my God!  Teeny, tiny!!  These are not pools.  More like wading pools.  3 feet at the deepest.  Everyone was standing around because they couldn't sit anywhere.  This place is SUPER small.  SUPER SMALL!!!!!   I'm just mad that anyone would ever pay to go this piece of sh!t pool.  Horrible.  I can't believe how pretentious the workers were being!

Nagomi Sushi is a completely unexpected delight in an unassuming corner of a plaza near Bathurst and Steeles. The prices are reasonable: expect to pay $10 for a special roll, $5-8 for a specific maki, or $12-15 for a sushi combo.

The chef makes a point of using large, fresh, tasty pieces of sushi on appropriately sized rice. This is the way sushi should be, unlike the giant rice balls many popular sushi joints pass off to ravenous customers.

Lovely decor, pleasant atmosphere with plenty of seating, consistently good service.

10123,1,1549065600000,"I need to compliant the Air Pro Master. They sent a unprofessional person to come to my house to fix the kitchen single handle faucet. Only my wife and my sister at home,  he came in he said we broke the parts (clip Moen #100429) and the parts not cover and can't be find or buy any more. My wife said how much the parts we pay for it. He said $400 and he might find a used one from his friend and will give me a call for how much. He said he could change the Magnum Cartridge right away if not the clip broken. We did not break the clip, we have home warranty, why would we do that. So we search online, asked friends. The parts only $3 online company but Moen shipped the parts 1225B and 100429 to us for free ( I paid $20 for overnight ) because life time warranty that I didn't know until my friend told me. So I called Air Pro next day and told them the parts in Friday and schedule between  8-11 am to fix it. I called the company at 10 am to check is he coming and the operator said your appointment is  8-11 am then hang up. I know but just want to make sure he is coming. Around 10:30am the repair guy called my wife cell phone and left a message said he got the wrong parts, will need to reschedule and not coming. I called him back right away and told him I told your company I have all the parts. He said sent him the pictures for sure. I sent him the pictures then he said the company already removed his schedule to my house and not coming. I called the company and the operator called him and said he is on the way to my house. When he arrived. first time I saw him. He just walked in without any tools ( my wife said same thing last time ). He used my tools to check around the faucet and said not only the clip broken also the other parts broken ( I don't see any damage from that part ). But my wife said he only holding the clip in hand and told her that is the parts need to replace and he doesn't have otherwise he could fix right away. I was mad he just messing around the faucet and do nothing. I asked him what is the parts name or number so I could call Moen for sure I get the right parts this time. He doesn't know. So I called the Moen in front of him and let him talk to Moen. So Moen is sending the parts to me and will receive today. He was try to assemble back the faucet and look like he having a problem how to do it (Moen Aberdeen one handle faucet). He said again nothing he could do just schedule another appointment when the parts come.  He also took the instruction sheet from the clip parts with him and said he wanted to take it with him. I really don't know what he is doing or even himself. He just make me feel he is fooling around. How could he tell me the clip can be $400 because no more product and he will find a used one for me for how much ? The main point is I found another plumber came to fix it for me for $40 after he left ( because I really don't trust him ). The plumber changed the Magnum Cartridge and clip (parts # 1225B and 100429 those sent from Moen) and now the faucet is working fine. What is it proof ?",2

10124,2,1550880000000,"It is a fast-food, chain, Mexican restaurant. My review is based on the assumption that you understand that first. I mean, you're not getting haute cuisine here, right?

They have tacos, burritos, and other typical Mexican-inspired fare alongside burgers and fries. Yes, you can get a combo meal that is a burrito, a taco, a drink and... fries. I don't judge. They do a good job with the fries: hot and crispy. 

Their chicken is tasty and I really like the chicken tacos. My wife had a steak burrito and let me try some of it. There was a chipotle cream sauce on it that was unexpected and complemented the rest of the burrito ingredients nicely (the one she got had fries in it, too).

I like the Medium sauce here. The hot is fine, but I feel that the Medium has the best balance between heat and flavor. They also have a Mild and Ketchup -- yeah, for the burgers and fries ;)

For the price, this is a good place, and the employees at this location were friendly. I don't go here all the time, but it feels like a step up from Taco Bell... a change of pace if nothing else",2

I think there a combination of Vietnamese style in their American food. That's why I enjoyed all dishes we ordered!!!
My favorite are chicken wings with fish sauce and banh mi belly pork. It was too damn good! I would say I was addicted to chicken wings and ordered extra one to eat at the hotel :)

10140,3,1549152000000,"I reserved a 7-passenger minivan months prior to the pick-up date in preparation for my cross country move to the East Coast. Upon arrival to the Dane County location, Amanda was very frazzled and told me that they did not have any minivans, but I was welcome to a sedan or a Nissan Rouge. I was very frustrated and Amanda said, ""I'm hoping desperately that someone drops a minivan off for you."" Hope is not a business plan. Hope is not a reliable way to run a business. 

I decided to leave for a bit and continue packing up my apartment in the hopes that a usable vehicle would become available. I attempted to call Enterprise Customer Service and the automated message stated that the Customer Service Department is closed on Saturday's - this is astounding to me! Fortunately, Amanda called back about an hour later and stated that a Chevy Tahoe had been dropped off and she could offer it for the same price. She was very kind and apologetic, and obviously did what she could to help me. 

However, a large portion of my items did not fit in the Tahoe because there was no rack on the roof for a car topper, which a minivan would have had. There is also less cargo space - 140.3 cubic ft in the Dodge Caravan vs. 94.7 cubic ft in the Tahoe. Now, these items need to be shipped to me at additional cost, which is unacceptable.

Overall, Amanda was very helpful and did what she could to help. Enterprise, however, needs to reassess their business plan. If I reserved a hotel room months in advanced, not having an available room would be unacceptable. If a table at a restaurant is reserved, it is expected to be ready when the guest arrives, or shortly after. This is how the customer service industry functions and clearly Enterprise cannot adhere to those standards.",2

Before we walked in, we see they use illy coffee beans for their coffee which was my wife's favorite. The coffee were pure, just what we needed in the morning. What amazed us even more were their sandwiches. we ordered bleu brie in panini and turkey in baguette. Their bread was freshly made daily, and they do a 1/2 price after 4pm on the breads before they close at 5pm. For a successfull sandwich the bread is very important. We can taste from the texture of the bread is crispy on the outside, but soft in the inside. 

The staffs were very friendly, and their cafe shop provides wi-fi and set menus. We took it to go since we were on a schedule, but the shop was almost packed with people. However, their service speed was kinda slow, since there were only 3 people on duty. So I don't recommend for a fast-paced person to come eat here.

10188,1,1551312000000,"Staff: 5
Food: 4
Value: 3 (used groupon but have to go with menu pricing)

Very cool concept, the groupon made it a great deal and the pizza was pretty good and done in no time at all. Definitely worth consideration if you are in a lunch time crunch and want some pizza.

Went at around 3pm and both girls behind the counter were friendly, informative and helpful, allowing you to taste a couple ingredients you may be unfamiliar with beforehand and offering suggestions such as mixing the diablo sauce with regular sauce to put out the fire...great tip!

I got one crazy pizza mixed with a ton of ingredients and one Margherita pizza to go. The sauce was good on the margherita but just not enough cheese...I know the cheese is the most expensive part of the pizza but if you are charging almost $9 menu price for a small margherita, I'd almost rather pay $12 and go to Settebello's for an insanely good margherita that's considerably larger...or with pizza hut and dominoes always at war with each other offering 50% discount online coupon codes you can get a dominoes artisan pizza for take out almost anytime for around $7...perhaps not quite as good, but more bang for your buck.

If I didn't have the groupon, I would say $20 is a bit steep for two small pizzas. 

The pizza industry is insanely competitive these days and just to be in the restaurant business in Las Vegas to begin with, you better have something magical.

If everyone is coming in with groupons and you have to give groupon 50% of the $7 they used to purchase it...just lower your price $1.50 and you'll have a lot of repeat business with an even better profit margin without having to rely on groupon.

TIP: Text 24587 on your phone while you are there and a coupon pops up on your phone for a free soda with your order (Man, I'm killing these guys).

I know I did some complaining on my 4 star review but the pizza was ""good"" and the service was great.

I'm a huge sushi lover and I've had sushi at many different sushi restaurants.  This is, by far, the best sushi I've had.  I'm normally scared to try new sushi rolls because I'm very picky and usually end up leaving not fully satisfied with the flavor.  However, I've yet to walk away from Sakana unsatisfied.  I've tried about 7 different sushi's there and loved every single one of them.  My favorite would be the 911 sushi roll.  It's the spiciest sushi I've had yet and I can't get enough of it.

The reason I gave Stancato's four stars is because they have recently started selling gluten free pizza! Anyone who is on a gluten-free diet knows how difficult it is to find good Italian take-out anywhere in the area. It's great that there is now another place that we can go to for some pizza! I was pretty impressed with the pizza and would definitely try it again!

10257,2,1549238400000,"I tried the eyelash perm, eyelash tint & eyebrow tint:

Eyelash perm: I have dead straight Asian lashes, so maybe because of that I got minimal results. Just a few of my left outer lashes got a slight curve but that's it! Ok, I got a slight general lift but it didn't meet my expectations at all.

Eyelash tint: Again, I am Asian and my lashes are already black, so saying that the results were minimal is expected.

Eyebrow tint: She said my eyebrow hairs took to the tint quickly so she removed it and showed me the mirror. I didn't like the way she shaped them, more thick and short than I'm used to but I didn't complain. She also told me that the tint would darken my skin so I would last longer. I showered that night and most of the tint washed away :(

Although I paid over $80 for practically nothing, the customer service is good. I called the next day and told them I wasn't satisfied with my results with the perm (I didn't bother complaining about the other two services) and they gave me a credit for future services. But I think most spas will do that anyway.

I'm going to try the eyelash perm at Upper Village Spa near Eglinton West station. They claim they provide excellent results and that the perming solution is why some perms work and some don't. So we'll see!


UPDATE: So I got my eyelashes permed at Upper Village Spa and my lashes are so curly! I explained that Dove Spa used the 'clips' that look like lash curlers w/o the handles, so the esthetician at Upper Village used these 'rollers' to which she glued my lashes prior to adding the perming solutions, and they came out so much better!

10267,3,1549670400000,"Okay so I'm a pretty big rum guy and well after finding out that almost no place in Vegas stocks Kraken Black Rum I was on the lookout for a cool hangout but not a bar that did. Well i found this place online listed as one of the best places to hang out, eat, shop, and get your rum fix of course!!!! So Tommy Bahama boasts a whopping selection of over 200 rums from all over the world and even has 2 bottles that are the only known bottles in existence so when they're gone they're gone.  I came in during happy hour (which is the best time to come by the way) to grab a nice Kraken and Coke and a bite to eat.  The place was pretty much empty save for a couple of groups of people so it was pretty quiet for the most part. The lady working the bar was immensely sweet and beautiful and she showed me the happy hour menu and gave me a few tips on how to save some money while eating.  
   I had both the burger sliders and the pork quesadilla and both were amazingly good. The burger sliders were a tad small but they were well cooked and flavorful.  The only issue with the sliders was the price differentiation from the quesadilla. The sliders were 7 dollars and you got less food while the quesadilla is 6 bucks. The pork quesadilla was recommended by the bartender and boy was I glad I took her advice. The quesadilla was  really well made and a pretty big meal considering it's very reasonable price (6 bucks like I said!). The quesadilla is served with a nice heaping side of mango salsa and is topped with goat cheese and beautifully cooked pork.  The happy hour was a highlight and I honestly will be coming back for the food and whenever I really crave some good rum. A word of advice though for any rum fans. So because they have over 200 different selections of rum, prices will vary depending on what you get. Cheaper rums (Captain Morgan, Bacardi, Sailor Jerry, etc) are right behind her on ground level while the really expensive stuff is above her with the whiskeys.  My Kraken Black Rum and Coke ended up costing 8 dollars which honestly wasn't bad at all and was pretty reasonable since it didn't tie into the Happy Hour. The only real con about the whole experience but not enough to deduct a star was the Happy Hour drink selection. Happy Hour really only covers a few wine selections, some rum concoctions, and really basic island drinks like a Mai Tai or Margarita. 
   All in all I really enjoyed my experience and the prices were not that bad. To show you how reasonable the prices were i'm a full time college student who is almost always broke due to tuition and I was able to eat at Tommy Bahamas lol. I was a bit afraid of the price because of the Town Square location but Tommy Bahamas offers really good food and drinks at a very reasonable price!  I definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes island style restaurants without the touristy feel that some of them have and also to people who want good food without the strip prices. This was a great experience and I will certainly be coming back.",2

Well after visiting here last night (10-26-14) I took this restaurant from a 5 to 4 star. I ordered the chili chicken as usual and I was pretty disappointed. Full of fat. I did initially ask for white meat only but the guy said they no longer do that. I ate a bit of it and now its sitting in the fridge. I probably won't finish it. For $13, I expect meat, not fat. The sauce is amazing but these people really need to start using only meat.
(12-8-15) ordered the chili chicken, again, along with the veggie Hakka noodles. He noodles were under cooked and the chili chicken isn't as spicy and flavorful as it use to be. Pretty disappointed. I use to love this restaurant and would always visit for chili chicken while I was in the area but I'm pretty sure last night easy last visit.",2

I asked about steroid treatment as this had happened before and the doctor said that there was no need. We went home hoping it would get better and it didn't. Next Sunday morning my wife got worse. I called Dr. Dana Forte for  an advice and she immediately offered help even she was out of state on vacation! She said what I thought the first doctor should have done in the first place. Dr Dana gave her some steroids treatment and right away within an hour the rash started going away!! Thank you for your help!,3

The cliffs are sandstone, so you'll need to wait at least 24 after a rainstorm unless you want to content with potentially brittle holds.  You can climb year round by chasing the shade/sun as appropriate.  The newish campground is fairly dull, but slightly more convenient than the Strip purely in proximity to the climbing areas.

The BLM is currently testing the feasibility of a 7am (v. 6am) opening time.  The kiosk operators didn't know if this would be permanent.  Also, a note about late exit permits for multi-pitch routes.

We sat immediately and waters were later brought to the table as usual. Our server was so uninterested in his job as a whole. We ordered our food, two sushi rolls and two teriyaki fried rice balls, which are our favorite. Our rice balls came in a timely manner, we finished those pretty quickly and waited for our other food patiently. Being that the host sat us right in front of the sushi bar we were able to see our food come up in the ""window"" ,we also sat and watched our food sit in that window for atleast 10 min while we watched serval servers and other employees walk by it countless times. There was other sushi rolls waiting in the window along with ours and those were taken to their table by who I thought was the manager (bald guy), while ours continued to sit there. 

Finally our server, who we haven't seen since he dropped off our rice balls, walks by the sushi counter and I think ""yes! Finally!"" But what does he do? Takes a look at it and continues on his merry way. At this point I'm tempted to go up there and grab my own food but I refrain and continue to wait patiently. 

After a few more minutes and more than a few hangry glares our server manages to bring us our food. He never comes back after this, not to refill our waters, not to make sure everything is okay, not to bring us or pick up the check, or even to give us the change for the bill, he never came back, NOT ONCE!

I happened through town this afternoon and noticed a sign that said ""The Locavore's Choice,"" so I had to stop and investigate. Sure enough, Paoli Local Foods is a charming store in a one-pony town, chock full of delicious, local products! There are cases and freezers stocked with local grass-fed beef, elk, deer, ostrich, chicken, duck, pork, lamb, and buffalo. There's a seafood case with smoked fish and frozen blue gill, halibut, salmon, etc.  I'm sure this list is even missing a number of their offerings. Oh, and did I mention their selection of local cheeses? Check.

Other products are available, such as small production organic canned foods and toiletries, but I won't lie--you can get these elsewhere in Madison for much less. All the same, it's cool that Paoli Local Foods is providing a much-needed outlet to this rural area. Another feature that I noticed, in the back of the store is a bulk section and also a small cafe featuring lunch items such as soup and sandwiches. Next time I'm going to the New Glarus Brewery with out of town guests, I think we'll make a stop here!

10354,2,1549411200000,"Novanta was a nice discovery for the family and me, and I can see coming back frequently in the future. Plenty of options to explore, even from a somewhat simple menu, which should provide ample reasons to return. There were a few distinct highlights and a couple of minor lows, but overall this was a very pleasant dining experience for all. Here's what we had:

House mozzarella w/ spicy salami - This was a stand out winner! The house mozz is creamy, fresh, and delicious. The taste is very subtle, but not at all boring. In fact, the magic of the cheese is how good it seems to make anything you pair with it taste. The obvious pair on this platter was a MOUNTAIN of delicious spicy salami. I was amazed at the generosity of this serving and if I see this again in the future I will be returning often for this dish alone (although the pizzas were also very good). There are several other ways to order a few different styles of mozz and this is something my wife and I in particular are excited to explore more in the future. 

Margherita pizza - This is a perfect example of what old school Neapolitan pizza is all about. Everything about this dish is in service of the crust, and wow does it deliver. The wood burning oven they use for making pizzas at Novanta imparts a deliciously charred crust. There's a subtle but present smokiness that adds a ton to the overall taste. The bright red tomato sauce lends a crisp acidity that is a text book foil for the creamy, string mozzarella. The herbaciousness of the basil brings a floral earthiness to the whole experience that simply can not be beat. Margherita pizza is an almost unbeatable combination of flavors, and when prepared this well it is truly a thing of beauty. 

Garbanzo salad - There was a lot of good things going on in this salad, but for me the whole was somehow less than the sum of it's parts. The highlight to me was the shaved Parmigiano, which was a nice counterpoint to all the mozz we had elsewhere in the meal. The peppers were crisp and very sweet (perhaps almost overly so for the salad composition). I'm not an olive fan, so I sort of avoided the kalamatas and the garbanzo beans were abundant, but very plain (as they are...). To me, his salad was missing maybe one component (thin sliced red onion? a higher ratio of vinegar to oil?), it just seemed a bit out of balance. The wedge of flat bread that's served on top was VERY good, but I just couldn't get into the salad. All that being said, my wife would completely disagree, she chose this salad and thought it was excellent...

Caserta pizza - This was probably the biggest disappointment of the meal. The same delicious crust from the Margherita was totally drowned out by toppings that just weren't very tasty here. I think the prime offender may have been the salami, which had a slightly unpleasant aroma and taste in it's cooked form. The roasting of the peppers was very subtle and they could have used a bit more, while the onions were also under cooked for my taste. This sounded like a great combination to me, but it just didn't quite work. There are other options at Novanta that I'd be far more interested in checking out the next time I come in. 

So that was the food we enjoyed at Novanta (the most important part of a Yelp review). The restaurant space is very open and somewhat sparsely decorated. It was by no means uncomfortable, but also not the sort of place I wanted to luxuriate. Above all I think I'd say it was 'functional'. The staff was very pleasant and the value for what we ordered was good (not amazingly affordable nor out of reach). Both my wife and I mentioned to one another that upon finishing the meal were were pleasantly sated, not stuffed nor still hungry. 

I'll certainly be back to Novanta soon and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll need to update my review to include all five stars!",2

He says the dish comes with veggies and a side of ""crunchy noodles"" and white rice. Again, there was NO noodles, crunchy or soft included! I spent nearly $40 and was not happy with their service and food. After a bit more words, the owner agreed to ONE store credit. Not two, just the one.

10371,3,1550016000000,"We went for dinner, and found the place almost empty.  Our server was polite, quick, but not particularly with it.  

My husband ordered a dinner salad, which arrived without any dressing.  It took over five minutes to get a little container with about two tablespoons of dressing.  The server did come back a few minutes later with a cream pitcher holding a quarter cup or so of dressing.

I ordered a Kobe burger with cheese, plain, telling the server I would put ketchup and mustard on it myself.  He therefore knew I would need these things.  Burger delivered with not one condiment, and none were on the table.  Apparently the place is too frou frou to provide mustard and ketchup in their bottles.  After flagging down the server, I got my condiments in the same tiny containers that were used for the salad dressing.  By now it's been close to ten minutes.  My burger isn't particularly hot, and the fries are well on the way to stone cold by the time the condiments arrive.

I had also ordered a thick chocolate shake without whipped cream.  I specified thick.  The server could have explained that the shakes there weren't thick.  He should have.  It was essentially frothy chocolate milk.  All of the syrup was sticking to the sides of the glass.  To demonstrate that it wasn't thick, and to mix it up, I talked to him for a couple of minutes while stirring it with my butter knife.  I complained that it wasn't thick, nor was it mixed.  He explained that the whipped cream would have covered that up.  Unless the glass is dunked in whipped cream, it would have been perfectly obvious that it was not mixed.  The chocolate milk tasted ok, but it wasn't the chocolate shake I ordered.

I also asked for napkins to use while eating the burger.  It was large and juicy, and the napkins at our table were linen.  The napkins didn't come, and I was about ready to use the linen dinner napkin when he delivered napkins - cocktail napkins.  For a 10-oz. burger.  For those who don't know the difference, cocktail napkins are those little coaster size napkins that sit under your beverage.  They were pretty insufficient when used as a dinner napkin, unless you ordered sliders.  

This was apparently the only napkins the restaurant had, as a couple nearby had sliders, requested napkins, and got a fistful of cocktail napkins as well.  

The burger was fairly good after I finally got some mustard.  The fries were okay when hot, but once cold, they were unappealing.  That's usually the case with fries.

We declined dessert.   Nothing had arrived as ordered yet, and we were tired of making experiments.  I had mixed my milkshake with a butter knife, eaten my hamburger with cocktail napkins, and my husband had gotten his salad without any dressing.",2

I'm trying to work my way through the list, but so far my favorites include the Testing Zone (breaded chicken, pesto, mozzarella) and a combination of the Veggie Zone and Parking Zone (broccoli, breaded chicken, mushrooms, mozzarella).

Sunday until 1am

They do lose some points for their turnover time though.  It takes them upwards of an hour to get the food delivered to you - the reason for which is because they need to make and bake your order first before they can get it out to you.

Plenty of room for a nice size lunch crowd, and I noticed most people were there for the sushi. I wanted Korean food, so we started with a kimchi pancake. It was huge, a single pancake the size of a large dinner plate, thick, and sliced like a pizza. Velvety inside, tasty, but without much crispness.

The beef was tender, but the egg was not sizzling hot, the kochujang (hot pepper paste) added flavor, but the dish still seemed like it was missing something. The pork bulgogi had a very light spice kick, and was sweeter than we're used too. 

Overall experience was nice. but not quite up to par of the tasty Korean food I've had in the past.",2
10411,3,1550275200000,"Decent food, nice atmosphere and good service. This was my experience at Pittsburgh Grill and Sports Bar when 4 of us stopped by after the last Steeler's game. We had originally intended to go to the Bettis 36 Grill and grab some food to wait out the traffi but, there was a line out the door. So, we kept walking and decided to try the Pittsburgh Grill and Sports Bar instead. When we arrvied, the place was fairly full of football fans but we were able to get a table right away. Our waiteress was quick to get us some hot drinks since it was freezing outside. We were able to watch the rest of the games on the multiple tvs in the dining room. I ordered a bowl of the chicken tortilla soup and tried my husband's quesadilla. The quesadilla was pretty average. It came with a small amount of corn and bean salsa. I would have preferred a side of guac. However, my chicken tortilla soup was fantastic. Just what I needed to warm up on a cold December day. I would argue that the soup was homemade which is quite unusual for a sports bar. The flavors were spot on and the chicken was in shredded chunks, not the unifromed cut up pieces you tend to see in this type of restaurant. My only criticism is that I wish there was more of it. The bowl was fairly small. Another interesting aspect of this bar is the cigar lounge. If you're a smoker or a cigar fan then you's probably enjoy this aspect. I did not. The smoke wafted out of the lounge and down the hall into the bathrooms! Luckily, the dining room was far enough away that I wasn't bothered while I ate. However, I smelled like a cigarette factory after a quick trip to the bathroom. Better ventilation is definatey neeed. I was also quite surprised by the bathroom attendants. This does not seem like the type of place to have an attendant. Overall, a good place to grab a meal before or after the game, just avoid the cigar lounge if you are not a smoker.",2

The toy area is really junky looking too. I do have nice toys to give but I don't think these people want nice toys. What a shame.,3
10420,2,1550880000000,"I want to put in a word for the good Dr. Thompson.  Many years ago I went out to CA on vacation and was body slammed by a wave and wrenched my back severely.  I spent about 9 months going to medical doctors trying to relieve the pain in my back which soon started to radiate to other areas of my body.  The medical doctors ran scans, sent me to physical therapy, which only seemed to aggravate the problem further...I eventually decided to try a chiropractor.  I went to Dr. Thompson and within 1 visit, I felt confident that he had located the muscle groups that had locked up and were causing me the most grief.  Within a few more visits, he had my back completely back to normal, and I have not had any problems since.  

Dr. Thompson does not use fancy equipment...he just does good old fashioned manipulation to put your body back and neck into a balanced state.

I have referred other family members and friends to Dr. Thompson who could tell similar success stories.  The most miraculous story was one person I referred, who had scoliosis which seemed to be progressing rapidly, was halted in it's tracks, after the prescribed visits to Dr. Thompson.   

If your neck and /or back is hurting, give Dr. Thompson a call...he takes most insurance, and even without insurance, he is reasonably priced.  He won't do any more than what is necessary to get you feeling better, and in most cases, HE WILL help you feel better.",2

I purchased this from a friend that bought it from Groupon then found out she can't use it because she does not have a Colorado license.

Even the few times events have been available, they are all awful events, I wouldn't go to them if I was paid to.

Starting with the wooden door entrance, you literally feel like you are stepping into an eclectic Vintage Korean cafe. Inside, there is an indoor green house, tiered book case bleachers, a wooden slide, unique artwork and lighting, to name a few. 

Apart from the aesthetics, I really only tried the Matcha Red Bean Cake and Matcha Bun since I came here for dessert. They do their Matcha really well in the cake, and the whipped cream with red bean layer really work together. I did like the Matcha Bun with red bean, but it didn't bring the strong Matcha flavor that I liked in the cake. I can't wait to come back here for coffee and tea!",2

Dim Sum ends at 3pm and we stopped in at 2:30pm. They were still welcoming and stocked with fresh food choices. We tried their sticky rice, bbq pork buns, shrimp dumplings, rice noodles and taro cakes. One bite and we knew this place was legit.

Went there in the middle of lunch hour and there was not much selection. They were too greedy to put out fresh sushi/dishes until someone gets the last piece.

10559,2,1550448000000,"Ordered this cake for my daughter's 3rd birthday and I was more than satisfied both with the design and the taste. We ordered redvelvet cake for this one and everyone at the party loved it. This bakery listened to my instructions well, i emailed them the picture of the design and another picture for a specific shade of blue and they got it perfectly.
The characters are store bought toys that we just put ourselves on top
Of the cake as they would have charged us more for the 3d characters. We are very happy with this finding dory cake. 
 Now my 2nd review is for the cake for the 1 year old boy which the Larry cake. We are also very satisfied with the design and taste of this cake. I sent them a picture and they followed the instructions. Moist cake, everybody loved it again.
The only thing is the letters that spelled ""william"" the lady told me it is $5 for each character letter.  So i said that is fine as it is a special cake for my little boy. It costed $35 for 7 letters of course. I was just kind of disappointed because it was a very simple letter that actually looked just like the letters that Drago Sisters bakery would use if u buy a cake from then and they would spell happy birthday with those letters free of charge. I thought it would be more a bigger sized letters to spell william. But then again I didn't tell them specifically. I just assumed it would be a lot nicer since it is $5 each letter. 
This is just a minor issue though. I still love this place and will order a custom  cake again. cakes are  pricey but worth it. Everybody ate the cake the loved both of them. We also ordered 2 dozens cake pops and again everybody enjoyed them. Paid $284 total for both of these cakes plus 24 cake pops. Thank you peridot",2

I am going on a trip in a few months and wanted an extra battery and a car charger for the camera.  I checked online but some of the OEM products I am just not willing to try yet.  I'd rather spend the money of real products from a reputable store than to deal with something purchased online that may or may not work.  

So I stopped in here on Saturday morning.  I walked in and someone greeted me right away and asked what I was looking for so he grabbed the battery for me.  I asked about the car charger and he pointed that out to me as well but you have to buy the charger and the travel package separately.  Ok...as long as I know they will work together. 

I came home and the battery works.  The charger seems a little cheap but it fits all sorts of SLR batteries and it has a USB port which will also come in handy.    

Besides all of my needs, they also sell lenses of all sorts, they have rent cameras and have all sorts of accessories for your camera.  And the best part, at least for me, is they are convenient and I don't have to drive all over Charlotte to get there. 

I guess I will have to see how far this hobby goes this time around but I could be a regular in this store...",2

What I liked about this place is that they served real pub food. That means cheap, good food with large portions.

The bartender was really sweet, she was chatting with three regulars when we came in and approached us as soon as we were seated. 

I was surprised to see that the menu carried more than your average cheeseburger and fries. The server recommended the Elvis Burger which was a combination of a beef patty with bacon, cheddar cheese, onion rings and peanut butter. 

I was delighted by the presentation of the burger which was stacked high and appropriately skewered in place. What made it even better was the fact that it came with a big bowl of poutine and a side of coleslaw.

The burger was delicious and the poutine was good too, although the gravy was a little sweeter than what I'm accustomed to.

They have a choice between thick and thin noodles, depending on what you want. We went for an early dinner so it wasn't very packed and we got our ramen quickly after we put our order in. The broth was rich and fatty just as I was craving for. Be prepared to feel a bit greasy after, but totally worth it.

And the fried chicken... not that good either. Our food has a specific flavor with some Variation. But when you eat something that makes you go, this is not Japanese. There's something wrong.

10637,2,1551052800000,"We were driving down Babcock on our way to a concert and wanted to grab dinner first. We had first pulled into another restaurant and found their wait was going to be 40 minutes and we didn't feel we could afford the time and opted to try something else. We were prepared for fast food and heading that direction when we passed this little restaurant and saw the seating inside and took a gamble. The menu is posted on the wall outside the door sans prices and I had a moment of doubt. I was looking for good food... but not $$$ food. 

The restaurant inside was beautifully decorated. It was quiet with subdued light. I thought it was possible that it was a new restaurant since it was 6:30 and there were many open tables available. We weren't seated right away and told it would be about five minutes. At first I thought it was odd but then the hostess whispered that she would go ahead and seat us if we didn't mind the 'less secluded' seating. 

The waitress arrived a bit later to our table and took our orders. I had heard of Moussaka in the past and saw it on the menu and wanted to try it, my husband chose a small pizza with white sauce and lamb and feta. While we waited for our dinners to arrive the waitress brought a taste of hummus and pizza bread tips. I am sure this was a patience builder for us since we had been waiting a bit during each element of the experience. It was delicious. Of course, I am biased since I have never met a hummus I didn't like. 

Dinner arrived hot and in generous portions. The square of Moussaka was large and I had the spinach and rice pilaf as sides. I found the rice pilaf to be the best item on my plate. I had a hard time not losing my manners while eating it. I also really enjoyed the spinach which was well prepared. I was not a huge fan of the Moussaka but I have decided that since both my sides  were delicious and the taste I had of the pizza my husband ordered that it must be that I don't care for the dish, not that it wasn't good. 

When the waitress checked on us again we mentioned we had an engagement to get to and she quickly provided our check and a few to go boxes. Dinner for two plus tip was $40. (Minus drinks since we are not the type to have drinks during our meals)

10649,2,1549065600000,"Food arrived fast but the server didn't hear everyone's appetizer order so I was stuck eating an appetizer alone. I ordered the egg plant one that he said was most popular and the favourite. It was ok but kind of bland. I was a bit disappointed.

The main course I ordered was the Zaffron Skewer which said ""this is show time!!!"" in the description. I was expecting to be blown away by the show of gestational delight but I wasn't. He also said regardless of the side I'd get I'd get a baked tomato but no baked tomato came with my dish! Greek salad has iceberg lettuce and garden salad comes with Thousand Island dressing FYI.

I thought it was supposed to be a nicer sit down restaurant but it was like a $5 breakfast place when pay as you have to get up to pay. That only took forever, as well as 5 people to do the bill. Really?

The service was friendly. They do not have any Persian-inspired cocktails, just daiquiris and margaritas. I was hoping for something out of the ordinary for drinks but nope.

3 stars is generous and I'd say closer to a 2.5. 

It was decent but I'm spoiled with Banu as my benchmark for Persian food. I'd definitely suggest going to Banu downtown over this one. More bang for your buck there and it's way tastier.",2

10659,3,1551225600000,"Blech. I wish I had that $3.83 back. I saw this place on Groupon yesterday, and the picture of the strawberry cupcake was so beautiful, I had to have one. I stopped by, and everything in the case looked pretty good. I settled on the strawberry, based on that Groupon picture, and its description - strawberry cake, filled with strawberry compote, and topped with strawberry buttercream. That description ending up being deceiving though. Everything tasted like fake strawberry, and the ""compote"" was that nasty gelatinous ""strawberry filling"" that comes in a tub. I'm not sure the ""buttercream"" had any butter in it at all, and if it did, it was overwhelmed by shortening. I ate a couple bites of the cupcake, then placed the rest of it back into the handy container to throw it away. It was just SO not worth the calories. And the price was outrageous for what are clearly low-quality ingredients (you'd be better off buying grocery store cupcakes). Maybe I just made a mistake by trying the strawberry. But I won't be going back to find out if any other flavors are better. 

When I left this place, I drove straight to Urban Cookies to get my fix. For just $2.80 I had a replacement cupcake that was far superior in quality and taste.",2

10683,1,1549756800000,"Oh my god.  Are you serious?  This is a restaurant?

I got so sick here, I felt like I was on my death bed.

Let me detail what happened here.

Firstly, try and call to get through to them, to make a reservation.  Good luck!  I think, out of a total of ten times calling them, I was lucky to get through once.

AND, THEN, these high faleuentant assholes want to hold a credit card for the reservation.  If you don't show, that's right!  $50 a pop!  Lord only knows how much money they would hold in the account area, before it clears.

Their dry ass corn bread biscuits fall apart in your hand, from their overdone bread presentation.  Why in the hell is raisin bread served at a tex/mex style place?  And, it wasn't that good anyway.

From their limited menu (What?  Does Bobby Flay have a limited imagination?), we weren't all that hungry, so my other half - Ralph - and I decided to order the lamb.  It came as two chops.  He likes his done one way, and me another. 

Now, the waitress was very nice, and tried to accommodate us.

So, she asked the chef.  That stupid idiot refused to cook what his PAYING CUSTOMERS wanted.  ARE YOU SERIOUS??!!  I have NEVER, EVER gotten that from ANY restaurant!  iN THIS ECONOMY??!!!

The issue was with one chop being cooked well done.  She had both of them done medium well, and then sent the other back to be done to my liking.

The potatoes were goopy, and tasted like they were made from a mix worse than Jiffy.

My prickly pear virgin drink tasted like the sourest of lemons.  Why did I have to add four packs of raw sugar?

The collard greens were overly spicy, as this isn't the traditional recipe.  Actually, nothing about this restaurant is traditional.  Had it had an ounce of French tradition, it would have been far better.

That same night, I came down with food poisoning, and was sick for the next two days.

We immediately called the restaurant, and complained.  Now, any other establishment worth it's salt wouldn't have blinked twice, and would've given our money back immediately.  Did idiot Flay?

NO!

We got referred to their chicken shit security team, who has to take a report, and him haw for over a week (while I am dying).

WE STILL DON'T HAVE A RESOLUTION FROM THEM!

DON'T EAT HERE!",2
10685,3,1550534400000,"I don't care how good the service is... the prices are astronomical... as in highway robbery.  I dropped off 6 items to be dry cleaned (2 tops & 4 pants).  My mistake was not checking the prices beforehand; I assumed it would be around $3-4 per piece.  When I arrived to pick up the clothing, the girl brought them out and told me the total was $40.  My immediate thought was that my husband dropped off additional pieces during the week.  I asked her, so do I have like 10-15 pieces?  She said, no, just 6.  I was absolutely floored!  I said so you mean to tell me that for one piece it's like $6-7?  She said yah, but we have coupons online.  I looked at my receipt & the tops were $7.25 A PIECE!!!!!!!!

The subs here are insanely good. Really. They're not especially creative, they're just done exceptionally well. My wife loves their veggie like she's never loved a fast food sandwich before. It's insane! 

The best part is how when you order a sandwich they tell you every single thing on the sandwich so you can add/delete items.

10708,3,1550016000000,"I'm new to the pho scene but I've been to China Town before and like the energy and vibe there.  I visited this restaurant with a friend for a late lunch today (Saturday) when the place was almost empty.  This restaurant has a casual vibe and is open 24 hours a day. I actually liked the decor- it has a natural look, with wood chairs and large wooden blinds in a cafeteria-like open space. I liked the fresh and clean look  - no old, dirty worn out rugs and dusty plastic plants like some restaurants have.  The servers were relaxed and friendly, and brought the food promptly.

Speed and convenience seem to be the words for this place. I liked the stacks of spoons and small bowls and the container of chopsticks on each table- no need to ask for anything. They bring a stack of paper napkins and you're pretty much good to go.  There are at least 5 different sauces available at the table, from sweet hoisin to killer-hot sriracha. 

Before my seafood pho arrived, the server placed on the table a large plate of bean sprouts topped with branches of thai basil leaves- I thought it looked pretty cool.  The pho bowl was HUGE- impossible to eat in one sitting!  I enjoyed it, (gotta say, those squid pieces I could have done without- but that's a personal problem).  We pulled leaves off the branches to put into the pho and happily slurped as much pho as we could eat before a personable server offered to pack up the rest for us to take home.  He agreed that the huge bowls of pho were too much for one sitting, but a great deal budget- wise. I paid $11 for an appetizer and the pho and have enough pho for one or two more meals. I should warn, however, that the noodles get soft and mushy in a few hours. Maybe you should take them out of the broth  if you aren't going to eat your leftovers for a few hours. Just an idea.

So, not a fancy place, but very inviting with decent food. I'd come back and I'd bring friends.",2

10730,1,1550966400000,"I was surprised to see that Maggiano's only had 3.5 stars. My family went there last night, and it was fantastic! 

Service: From the hostess to the manager that stopped by our table, everyone was great. Our waitress was quick, attentive, and had a very pleasant and energetic attitude. She spent time making recommendations (which were on point), and making sure we were taken care of. My step-father loved the wine glasses with the ""M"" etched into them (their last name is Miltz), and the manager stopped buy and set everything up for my step father to purchase a dozen. Also they sent out a complimentary appetizer of fried ravioli (which were HUGE and absolutely perfect) to our table just because we were new to the restaurant. 

Food: Great. I'm a huge Italian food lover, and a foodie in general. I'm not one that thinks Applebee's is class A dining, so I consider myself to have decent taste. We had the seasonal white wine sangria with cantaloupe, pineapple, and strawberries. So perfect and refreshing. The bread was incredibly soft and delicious. My boyfriend and mom both got the ""Lighter Take"" of chicken parm. I tried it, and it was excellent. It was a great portion, and you couldn't tell it was healthier at all. Also it's great they have several options for those watching their waistline. I had the chicken and spinach manicotti. The chicken was tender and well seasoned, the spinach was bright and obviously fresh, the cheese blend was perfect, and the Alfredo sauce was flavorful without being salty. It was comfort food to the max. My step dad had the seasonal crab and asparagus bruschetta. It was also delicious, however he was a little put off by the crab being creamed, since it didn't say so on the menu. We ended the dinner with a tiramisu- which was one of the best I've ever had (and tiramisu is my favorite dessert). It was so good that my boyfriend, who insisted he was too full for dessert, ended up devouring half of it because it was so great. If I had anything to complain about, I'd just say that the salads had too much dressing for my taste. But next time I'll just ask for it on the side. 

Seriously, this place is fantastic. We'll be going back soon!",1

I had a big party of about 10 people. The line was long on a Friday night but it went by quick. I felt the happy hour was not worth it! With the prices we paid for happy hours (meaning free drinks, free alcohol) we did not get that! The alcohol wasn't the choice I will go with. The beers tasted awful. Our bartender was a woman, rude and I was not satisfy with her service. Before buying my happy hour tickets, I read good things about HH. That the male bartenders were great, consistent drinks, and great service. However, with our bartender, she was rude right off the bat. The way she talked, and vibe. My whole party felt it.

10794,3,1549584000000,"Reading the other reviews on this site makes me feel like all of us giving 4-5 stars are using a different company than those giving 1 star. I moved yesterday and chose 1st Integrity to handle my move because of the Amazon Local $99 voucher. But unlike some other people commenting here on Yelp, I READ my voucher and knew I only had two hours of move time and up to a 3rd hour for travel time. It took my movers three hours and 15 minutes to load, drive, and unload total. So of course I expected to be charged for an additional hour. My crew (Ralph & Sean) were wonderful: professional, polite, funny, and expedient. Sean even felt bad charging me for the third hour since I had a voucher. 
The only reason I'm not giving them a full 5 stars is because the owner had to replace the first crew assigned to me when they were an hour late getting to my place. So officially the movers showed up 90 minutes late. However, the owner refunded $20 of my final bill for having to switch crews on me. I move a lot - ten times in the last ten years - and I know if I move again in a year I will be calling 1st Integrity again. But this time I will ask for Ralph & Sean up front and not even bother with a voucher... their rates are pretty fair without one! The final total came to $98 with tax, before the $20 refund.

10798,1,1549929600000,"I've been to a couple of other Smashburger locations in Las Vegas and Overland Park KS, and this was the worst Smashburger experience.  We came in on Saturday at 1:45 pm and there were about 12 to 14 people in front of us.  After about 5 minutes half the people in front of us left.  In total there were probably 12-15 people that we saw walking out because of the wait, including after we sat down and ate.  We finally got to order after about 14-15 minutes waiting, there were only 3 people that we saw working, the person taking the order, the person cooking the food and maybe a manager handing it the food.  The three didn't seem very happy, especially the older lady taking the orders and taking out the food (leaving the register with no one for 5-7 minutes at a time.  It would have went a long way for them to acknowledge that they're short on people today and say sorry about the wait.  Not even a thank you after we placed our order.  Though this attitude seem to be par at some Chinese restaurants I've been to.  I don't expect this at an American restaurant.

After ordering, our food came out within 7-8 minutes, much quicker than expected considering how long it took to order.  We ordered 2 kids smash burgers with sweet potato fries (an extra $.50 upgrade--it only costs $.20 to upgrade from regular fries to sweet potato fries for the regular side, but costs $0.50 for a kids meal upgrade :(), an Oreo shake, an avocado club grilled chicken and a triple double.  We used a coupon for a free burger.  Even with the coupon the total was over $26.

The kids burgers were small, as expected.  It has been a 2-3 years since I've been to a Smashburger, but the triple double burger seemed small.  The only difference between my kids' burgers was another patty and lettuce tomatoes and pickles.  My main problem with the Triple Double was that it was soaking in grease.  When I lifted the burger from the paper, there was lots of grease on the paper.  When I put the burger down and looked at my fingers, it was covered in grease.  If I wanted to eat a grease burger, I would go to one of its competitors instead.  My wife said the avocado club grilled chicken was greasy, but not as bad.  My kids said that their burgers were fine and not greasy like my burger.

Like most of the others, we just left everything on our table, the wire trays, drink cups, napkins, etc. because the only trash can near the kitchen door we saw was completely filled with trash and trays.  There were no other trash cans that we saw.  We had to clean our tables ourselves so we could sit at a table.

Maybe we should have left like the people we saw leaving before and after ordering, but we didn't--this is what we get for staying.  If the 3 people working there weren't happy, then I don't expect that anyone there would be happy as well, including the customers.  I don't recall 1 smile from any of the workers the whole time we were there, in fact I don't think there were any smiles from customers either.

Only one other table was occupied when we arrived, which was probably a good thing since we were a little loud.  Gary and I both had pizza, he a potato and gorgonzola (which I did not try because I think gorgonzola is terrible).  He loved it and ate every last bite. 

I had the margherita pizza with fresh mozzarella, basil and added prosciutto.  Their tomato sauce was sweet and smooth and just wonderful!  The pizza crust was charred just the right amount and had those pockets of air dough that I love tearing apart (or sticking my finger into).

Eventually a young lady seated us and said our server would be with us right away.  15 minutes later our irritated table was greeted.  He made us feel like a complete incovenience.  After someone came by and gave us water and bread, we waited 20 MINUTES for our server to come back over and take our order.  We hadn't even had our drink order taken at this point.  Bread and water had run out.  I had to personally wave down our server to come take our order and even then he checked on 3 other tables before coming over to us.  So, finally we get our wine and beverages and then he runs off again.  We ran out of bread and water all over again.   The restaurant was not busy by any means.  So, our food comes, my eggplant parmesean is cold and tastes like cardboard, and 2 gnocchi dishes that came out were so over cooked it was uneatable. Since nobody cared to come check on us until I had to wave down the server again, their food was't returned till everyone was almost done.  In need of a meal to come out quick, they both ordered ravioli to replace the gnocci.  The ravioli took over 25 minutes.  Lets be honest.  It's noodles.  Pop them into their already-boiling water for 5 minutes and done.  But nope, 25 minutes later they get their meals.  In the meantime, we have a table full of dirty dishes.

The ONLY reason why this restaurant got 2 stars, was because of the managers service, even though with a large party in a not-busy restaurant, you'd think a manager wouldve come over at some point to just say hi. This was supposed to be a special dinner to celebrate our engagement and it was a complete disappointment.  We are locals and we will never be back.",2

Nothing fancy, but just the perfect plain pizza crust that tasted like the crunchy bottom of a perfectly cooked homemade biscuit. Excellent all around. Even with the small wait, definately worth it. And our server Mike was incredibly nice and hospitable. Engaged in light conversation while we waited and didn't make us feel rushed at the end of the night when we were still finishing our slices 10 minutes before close.

An extensive list of ""add in"" vegetables means never really ordering the same thing twice! They have yet to decline my request for sliced tomatoes instead of the potatoes that  normally come with this selection.

The cold brew, which I always order, is always smooth and clean. Never over boiled or burnt, never bitter.

There are receptacles and power strips available for charging computers etc. A nice atmosphere with different seating options and music that charms without being intrusive.

We were approached by a short, plump, balding associate, and explained that we had a couple of questions.  He explained that he was in sales, and that we should book a class.  End of conversation...other than the suggestion to try google.

I didn't/don't want to book a class, between these phones, iPads, and an iMac; we have probably spent north of $5K in Apple stores on Apple stuff.  We have had questions in the past, and have dropped in at both the Biltmore and Chandler Apple stores.  Our questions were answered, and we went on our way, happy.

I don't know if Mr. Sales is new to sales, or if he lost his job at the used car lot; but he's not a great first contact for customers, and was about as helpful/useful as an accordion on a fishing trip.

I had blackened snapper with a creamy crab and crawfish sauce. It was spectacular. No joke, I can die happy now. Very rich. My husband had the jambalaya and said he enjoyed it very much. 
The wait staff was attentive, they refilled our drinks several times and asked us an appropriate number of times if we needed anything else and made sure we were happy with the food.

I used to love their Pot Roast Nachos, but a few years ago they changed the recipe (the pot roast is nowhere near as generous as it used to be).  But I would say the food is reliably good, and the service is generally excellent (except when they are overwhelmed on game days).  

I do have a great story about meeting Hulk Hogan at this location once, so I do have a special fondness for Atria's.  They are well managed and local.  

But the dining scene in Pittsburgh has become a lot more creative, I think Atria's needs to keep up and offer something new and different.  Until then, it's still pretty good and fairly reliable.",2

The food arrived hot and in a timely manner.
The hot and sour soup was great with just the right amount of spice and was probably my favorite thing we ordered.
Mongolian beef was good, but I'm a harsh critic on this dish, because the chinese restaurant in our old neighborhood had the best one I've ever had.
I haven't dined in yet, so I can't give a rating on that, but I will try it out one of these days. In the meantime, I absolutely will be ordering delivery again in the near future.

Sidenote- if you are debating between this restaurant and Great Wall chinese restaurant in the same area, go here. It is a thousand times better than Great Wall. Seriously, it beats it by a landslide. You can check my review on that one to see what I mean.",3

They say the love is in the details and Cherry clearly embraces this philosophy. Both locations are beautiful, and stylish and always smell great!! That may seem like an odd thing to mention, but when you go you'll understand :) They provide bottled water, a variety of Keurig coffee flavors, mints, scented hand sanitizer...they even play Sirius radio!

He looks pissed lol he comes back and we tell him we want the hot pot special and our free appetizer with the Yelp check in. He brings us a menu for the hot pot and tells us to mark what we want. We get the split broth and mark assorted meats and veggies and seafood. He comes back and asks how many orders of the things? We all look at each other confused lol I guess we were supposed to mark it with numbers of orders. We told him how many and sorry we didn't know that's how it goes. He says ""well now you know."" Lmao rude. The potstickers come and they're good. The rest of the food comes and we asked a different server (ours went missing) if we can have another set of sauces since we're a party of 5 and we wanted a set for the other side of the table. She says no we have to finish the sauces we have first. We ask for tongs for the raw meats and she said no, they don't provide that. So we just ended up using a fork and pushing everything off the plate into the pot. The food was ok. The broths were pretty bland. Sauces were eh. The meats and veggies were pretty good quality. We wanted some rice and our servers were nowhere to be found so it was the manager who got it for us. the service was really lacking, and the food isn't good enough  for us to come back.

I spotted a Chi hair straightener for $99.99, but when I opened the box, someone had replaced it with a cheap straightener!  So there is obviously a theft problem.  Not the store's fault, but it is a shame.

Our other two entrees came with rice also ice cold. The waiter made a comment that we should have said something about  the rice right away. But he was not around to complain. They did keep our water glass full because the bus boy was doing his job. Now I will be fare, I did order the Red Snapper and it was perfect.
We don't mind spending money on our dinners while on vacation, and we do spend a lot, but we will not return back to this restaraunt because they had both bad food and service with an attitude.

The location is well hidden, not easily seen from main road and is hampered by the Landlord ban on overt advertising and outdoor entertainment. Unfortunately since The Irish pub was let go from this location many years ago, several ventures have failed. 

Inside the decor and music carry an Caribbean theme, and are pleasantly welcoming. It is good to see the bar from O'Shea's still in use and in fine condition. 

We ordered 3 starters and two sides and a desert (baked banana and Icecream- it was awesome). The West Indies BBQ shrimp, smoke fish dip and shrimp BRUSCHETTA. 

Though I thought the price of the food items was a little high, the quality and taste was very satisfying and clean and flavourful. I will return to try other items on the menu.

She then twisted the cap back on without disinfecting it, only to reopen and use it again. Being in the medical field I was appalled and informed her to stop using it as I now knew whomever that bottle was used on prior was definitely not sanitized effectively. Once I got home, the nail polish on my thumb chipped. Next it was my pinky. The next day more nail polish chipped including my cuticles peeling and a hang nail showing on my index finger. I called the salon to express my concerns, they told me to come I and they would redo it. I was not able to return for the next few days due to work and living 30miles from Westgate.

I explained to her that I have always had regular manicures from other salons and my experience like this has never once happened. She became very rude stating she would not redo them for nothing. Everyone was looking. I hope they heard because I have never experienced 1) extremely poor quality of a manicure, 2) witness to risk for spread of infection due to poor sanitization protocols (this is in my opinion disgusting) and 3) horrible, absolutely horrible, customer service.

I will forever be a Classical music fan and thrilled to say that I'm a huge fan of the Phoenix Symphony. Cheers***",2

The food presentation was very pretty and my chimichangas were awesome. A few more people came in while we were there. Not sure why the place was so empty, we will be back soon!",2

Came on a Saturday morning.  Service was very friendly and prompt.  I ordered the peameal bacon benny, and my wife ordered the smoked beef brisket benny.  You get three pouched eggs, and the meats are thick cuts.  Both were fantastic!  $10.xx.  Their prices are quite decent for what you get.  Taste is phenomenal!  The hollandaise sauce was amazing!  I could drink it.

Can't wait to come back next weekend to try something else on their menu.",2

The dish is not served in coconut milk like it's Thai counterpart. Instead, it's loaded up with all sorts of veggies on a huge platter, easily making two meals.  The saffron rice is special too, and complements the flavors really well. And, unlike most curries in Thai restaurants, Kaya's is vegan (among a few other amazing sounding menu items)!

Great happy hour deal, although I wish it was still 5-7pm instead of 4:30-6:30pm - that half hour does make a difference when you get off work at 6!",2

I went with a group of ten people and everyone loved their food.  I had the chicken chimichurri sandwich and it was delicious!  Just enough sauce and spice.  The French fries were seasoned to perfection and crispy. Hubby got the chicken n waffles...the waffle was to die for!  Now for the best part- $15 bottomless bloody marys, bellinis and mimosas!  The bloody mary was spicy and not too filling.  The bellinis, made with peach juice, champagne and peach schnapps were a nice change from just the basic mimosa.  I can't remember our server's name, I wrote it down in my notes on the Yelp app, but somehow lost it (she had short blonde hair).  She was amazing!

11112,2,1549670400000,"Ordered a round of drinks at The Punch Room on Friday night. I selected Strange Brew, and also had a few sips of the Jack Talk Thai Real Good and the Crafted Punch.

Quality
The evening started with a small sample of the Crafted Punch being served along with a tiny snack. I was immediately impressed as the Punch was probably the best drink of the evening. It managed to highlight the alcohol, while at the same time giving it a fruity edge. I was less enthusiastic about the other cocktails we ordered. I went with Strange Brew, which mixed bourbon with hazelnut milk, and then placed a coffee ice cube in the center. The problem with this however is only the midway point of the drink is it enjoyable. The start is too strong and the end is almost all coffee. And it is hard to love a drink that is only good for a limited span. My girlfriend selected the Jack Talk Thai Real Good, which mixed tequila with chartreuse, lemongrass syrup, and fresh muddled basil. It was overwhelming with basil, and I did not enjoy the few sips I had. My girlfriend liked it, but was far from crazy about it.

Quantity
The drinks were a fair size and clearly used a good amount of alcohol. I also appreciated the small sample of punch provided at the start.

Value
Expect to pay between $17 and $20 for a drink, unless you decide to splurge for the $400 cocktail. You are clearly paying more than you should for the exclusive atmosphere and the fact that it is the Ritz.

Ambiance
The Punch Room is located inside the Ritz Carlton in downtown Charlotte. Found on the fifteen floor of the hotel, it exudes exclusivity and class. Just to enter we had to wait thirty minutes, but after the wait we finally got to enter the mysterious doors. The space itself is dimly lit with tons of candles and a few strategically placed yellow lights. The far end has the small bar, but the rest of the stretched out space is full of leather couches and oversized chairs. Simple artwork and a few bookshelves can be found on the walls, and beads hang down over the windows. We were told the reason the windows were covered was because the view was not very good, but a quick peek showed differently. In the background classical music played softly. There is no doubt that this bar is a magnificent environment to have a drink.

Crowd
When we arrived we were told it would be about a thirty minute wait. I had read it was a small bar, but I was honestly surprised by the wait time. And I was correct because when we finally got inside we found the place nearly empty. Even with thirty seats, they purposefully seemed to only fill ten. While this makes it an intimate experience, I found myself upset that they made us wait when they clearly had space for us.

Service
Beyond slow and with no excuse. Maybe I was doing things wrong expecting my cocktail to come out relatively quickly after waiting for a seat for thirty minutes, but no one seemed to be in any rush. It took nearly an hour for us to get our drinks, which while I am sure take some time, could not have taken that long. The slow wait nixed any idea of ordering a second drink, as we instead struggled to grab the attention of staff to get our check and go. Don't even bother coming unless you have hours to kill.

Parking
Located in the middle of Downtown Charlotte, we just walked over from our hotel. However, for those driving I believe if you valet at the hotel they will validate your parking.

Extra
While the aura of The Punch Room makes it appealing, it just did not live up to the hype. The creative cocktails we ordered did not hit the spot and the aggravating wait and service were very frustrating. I personally enjoyed our experience at the lobby bar better with slightly cheaper drinks and a warm fireplace.",3

11131,1,1550016000000,"This is for sushi lovers: my friend and I were looking for good sushi takeout on our way home and decided on this place based on the overall good Yelp reviews. The hostess was friendly and when I asked if we could just sit at the bar and order our takeout then leave she said that would be fine. That's when things went downhill. I had to nearly tackle a waitress to order. Both of us ordered sushi and she said it would take 20-30 minutes. Not great but ok I can deal with that so we ordered drinks. From the time we sat at the bar to when received our food it was 1 hour..... 1 hour! For sushi. The other big problem I had was that my salmon nigiri (raw) was placed on the back wall in front of me and wasn't given to me for 10-15 more minutes before I asked the waitress what the holdup was. Mind you, there was also no apology for the longer than expected wait, nothing. But At this point I'm starving so I ate the sushi- let's pray I don't get sick. The salmon nigiri was good and their ""special"" roll of the day was spicy salmon roll which was ok at best. This was the worst sushi experience I've had and believe me I've had many. The consistent vibe I got brig there was they didn't want us there. I would never go here, they are extremely short staffed, don't seem to have the slightest clue about customer service and overall mediocre food.",2
11138,3,1550102400000,"Fox, you surprised me!

After going to four different Fox Concept restaurants and leaving unimpressed every time, we tried the Arrogant Butcher.  Maybe we've just had bad luck at the other restaurants in the portfolio, maybe Arrogant Butcher is the star of the show.  Anyways, enough about that.

We came eArly on a Friday evening, managed to catch the very end of happy hour.  Had the pretzels, they were very good...I'd ask for a half size portion next time, they're so good you can't leave one behind.  

Since it was Friday I had the king crab cioppino, it was excellent.  The crab was not a few flakes thrown in just for the name, big sweet pieces right on top.  The supporting cast of fruits de mer were just as good.  They did a great job on this dish.  

Oh, totally need to mention the service the waiter was great.  The lady even mentioned how good the quality of customer service was here.  As we were paying he asked if we had parked at city centre....validated parking.  Not a big deal, but a really good touch.

Inside felt similarly barren... it was just too quiet. I mean, nothing wrong with that, but it was kind of a strange quiet for a place that you'd never consider fine dining.

All that being said, we ended up with a pretty decent meal that included some pasta and a pizza at an affordable price. Service was mostly good, though we did have one wait.

I think the place could be good; it's definitely close, but they need to refine their process and somehow figure out how to inject some life into the building. It just doesn't seem to have any personality.",1

Inside are rows of rounded booths which I also loved. For my first Dim Sum experience, I wanted to go in with an open mind and try anything that was put in front of me. I figured, if it's on a menu and people order it, there must be something to it. And I'm glad I did! I tried so many new things, and a few (I'm embarrassed to say) I don't remember what it was, but I'll try to recap. My ultimate favourite, the special bbq pork bun, was something like I've never had before. Sweet and savoury at the same time, it really was the world's best bun! :) Beef rice noodle roll, pork and shrimp crispy spring rolls, mushroom and vegetable dumplings, chickens feet (which I never thought I'd try, less enjoy..!), pork and shrimp shumai, and some cute little deep fried pear-shaped pork dumpling thingys that were just the best! I also had my first congee which I quite enjoyed. I think it was the lobster, clam and fish. To finish, I tried the deep fried durian cake (!!). Surprisingly, it wasn't half bad! Sure, I smelled cat pee for the next half hour coming from nowhere, but I'm still happy I tried it.

11229,2,1549929600000,"Based on the high recommendations from my foodie friends, I was expecting the best steak of my life at BLT.  As it turns out, I thought my steak was OK, the rest of the meal was pretty good, and the service was adequate.   Maybe my expectations were too high.

I also have to admit that I may not have the proper palate for this place:   I like my steaks lean and tender, not necessarily ""full of flavor"".  BLT emphasizes wagyu ""Kobe"" style beef, which is intended to have a *very* high fat content for added flavor, and BLT's steaks are certainly flavorful.  My wagyu skirt steak was OK, but in retrospect I probably would have asked them to cook it longer (maybe medium or medium plus) instead of medium rare if I had realized the fat content in the steak was so high.   I would also say that the steak was over-seasoned for my taste.  A steak with this much natural ""flavor"" doesn't need more salt.  

The sides were good, some very good.   The complementary pate and popovers were outstanding.   Spinach salad was fine, nothing special.  Same with the potatoes and asparagus.  Peanut butter mousse with banana ice cream was excellent.   

Service was fine, nothing more or less.   They weren't quick, but it's not the sort of place where you need to be rushed.  I greatly enjoyed the views of Camelback Mountain from the patio, so I wasn't in a hurry.  It did seem like we had several different people waiting on us, maybe there was some confusion by the staff.  

So overall, BLT was fine.  Certainly not bad.   But I was expecting something that was a notch above the other steak houses in Scottsdale, and I can't say that BLT met that expectation.   Admittedly, I shouldn't have  ordered the Wagyu beef;  it's not my thing, and that's not their fault.   If I go back (and I probably will because my foodie friends love it), I'll get one of the other steaks.",2

I loved that they make a commitment to local produce and businesses.  We had some local hard cider and a saison to drink.  Both were delicious, and it was actually hard to decide given the great beer list.  

As recommended, we had the animal frites to start.  They were decadent!  Fries covered in savory gravy, with thick-cut bacon chunks, melted mozzarella, two fried eggs, and a spectacular whole grain mustard.  I personally thought that they were a bit much, and wouldn't get them again myself, although I definitely see why people love them.  I think they'd be better shared among four people; it was too much food for just my husband and I.

We also had the chickpea wrap and the burger.  The burger was done well and simply to let the grass-fed beef shine, and it was delicious, but it wasn't spectacular.  Just a burger, but with superior beef.  The chickpea wrap was AWESOME!  It's essentially a home-made falafel with pickled veggies to give it some tang and crunch.

When you think of pub food I believe most of us expect greasy burgers and wings, at least something to soak up the excessive  beer. I walked into Silky's (having been there before and leaving under impressed) with that mind set but instead was blown away by the menu. 

It contained your standard burger this, nachos, salads, etc. It was also paired with the Chef's daily creations which were mostly heavier dishes. My friend and I settled on New England  Clam Chowder and coconut shrimp as an appetizer followed up by the crab cake sandwich to split. The soup was okay, very filling, creamy, just enough veggies and seafood. What really hit home was the shrimp- five jumbo, succulent shrimp paired with a chutney sauce and strawberries. It was one of the costlier items on the menu and worth every scent. The sandwich was also fabulous,  I dressed it up with some sauce but the patty  was so well prepared it could stand alone in flavor. 

To top off a wonderful meal, our bartender Chris was lovely! Plus- Wednesday after 9 they offer $2.75 drafts and bottles (Magic Hat Electric Feel paired nice with the seafood,  kudos to Chris )!

It's right across from West Towne but is located on a little side street that nobody uses, so I'm sure a lot of people see it and then just go to Olive Garden.

The food, you ask?  I really like it, but I'm a sucker for over-cheesed pastas so you'll have to keep that in mind.  The lasagna was generous with the meat (beef and Italian sausage) and featured digestion-hindering amounts of cheese.  The baked ziti was similarly cheesed.  Both are great.

I also tried the Italian Beef.  It was good but I think they were trying too hard.  Roasted garlic aioli?  Spicy giardiniera pesto?  Garlic-herb bun?  I'm surprised they didn't throw on the ""chipotle ranch"" and ""honey mustard mayo"" that adorn their other sandwiches.  I think the sandwich would have been better with just the mozzarella 

Service has been okay both times.  The waitstaff can get messed up over who gets which entree, and sometimes sides are switched.  Overall, I don't get too upset unless I get the wrong food or it arrives too slowly, neither of which has happened at Bella Vita.

I recommend this place if you're in the area.  I would really like it to succeed since it's a lot better than most of the restaurants in the immediate area.  Bonus tidbit for militant anti-chain folks: this place isn't a chain (even if it feels a lot like one); it's locally owned so you don't have to feel bad spending money here.

He upgraded our car to a full sized vehicle for free and dropped the young driver charge for us from $20 a day to $10 a day! It saved us over $100 :) he was also very kind in warning me of all the crazy drivers in Vegas and the police speed traps in California (where we're heading to after Vegas) 

The car was very clean and still had that new car scent. But took off one star because there were a bunch of scratches from the previous user.",2
11298,2,1549065600000,"Again the owner proves her dishonesty. Wow, people like her should not even be allowed to have a business. I never said I was going to pay $60 dollars, I have always paid $30 or $33. Again I will state so ppl do not get confused by the owners dishonest comment. I had payed my last visit for my dog to have her nails painted, Brenda directly told me that she would paint Myla's back nails my next visit with no additional charge since I already payed. I reminded them about it and they refused to give me the service I already payed for, so I asked for them to either keep their word or to take off 5 bucks. When she told me the bill was $60 she said it was her mistake because I originally booked an appointment for a full groom, then changed my mind because I didn't want myla losing her colors. Which they were aware that I was most likely going to change my package. And again the owner lies and try's saying the bill was $60 over something else. Not to mention every time I have took myla there they have never plucked her ear hairs like I've asked them to, which is included in the package I always got. Actually yes Brenda did get extra gratitude, as well. Funny that you don't remember that, I guess that tip wasn't appreciated. My 2nd visit with Brenda she did not get any extra gratitude because I spent $28 on the brushes, that I should go return now. But I won't. Hahaha. Also they did refuse to give me my dog over 5 dollars. And I do have everything on tape to prove their dishonesty. If anyone would like to see it I'll be glad to show them. not to mention when they were swiping my card and had problems the owner screamed at Brenda to take my dog away and to the back until they got it to work. How ridiculous. And you can lie and say what you want but videos do not lie, and nor does your cameras either. After they acted so shady I would not even feel comfortable leaving any pet alone with them. It's a shame.",2

Bill has saved us quite a bit of money by diagnosing and repairing the problems that have arisen over the last couple years. Most of the time with other mechanics whatever the symptoms are, the problem is going to be the most expensive component and at least $500. With Bill, it's not like that. In several instances, Bill found ways to fix the problems and it wasn't even $100. Skilled, knowledgeable, honest mechanics seem to be hard to find. We've found one with Bill.",2

I went for the free 6 ounces of frozen yogurt good for yesterday only for National Frozen Yogurt Day.  They were only accepting printed coupons, which was kind of a pain.  They had a few sample cups out.

They had Taro frozen yogurt which was the first time I have seen it at a Menchie's.  I have been to the Menchie's in Central Florida (Winter Park, Orlando, Palm Bay, and Melbourne) and Colorado.

11371,2,1549152000000,"Updating my review because I recently came to Harris grill for brunch, for the first time! It was amazing!

It was a gorgeous spring morning and I wanted to get out of my house and go somewhere awesome for brunch, with a patio. I tossed around a bunch of places and my boyfriend and I agreed on Harris. I checked in on the ""no wait"" app when leaving my house (a 40 minute wait was estimated), drove the 20 minute drive to Harris and was seated right away! We sat on the patio, of course, which was such gorgeous. 

The brunch at Harris is a buffet- which I had no idea about until arriving. It was only $15 and included your choice of juice, a frozen mimosa or a bloody mary. I went with the frozen mimosa (duh)! It was delicious and had a nice kick of alcohol to it, which I loved ;)! The buffet was pretty impressive! Eggs benedict, chicken tenders and waffles, omelets made to order, bacon, sausage, bagels with all of the fixings, fresh fruit, potatoes and sautéed onions with peppers and macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese was a little dry, but everything else was AWESOME. I loved the chicken and waffles and went back up for seconds after. The sausage was also very good. My boyfriend and I were also in love with the potatoes. 

For $15 a person, we were stuffed and very satisfied. I didn't think I could love Harris Grill more than I already did, but coming to brunch proved me wrong!",1
11379,3,1549497600000,"Everyone thinks Barnes and Noble will be put out of business due to Amazon. Oh, so wrong. They are putting themselves out of business due to a combination of inept management, 1995 policies, and lack of customer service. This is 2017. No one puts up with the nonsense described below nowadays.

I went into the store and found a book that would make an ideal gift. No price tag or shelf label to be seen. I took out my trusty smartphone, went onto Barnes and Noble's OWN WEBSITE (not Amazon) and found the identical book for $19.99. 

Went to the cashier (there was only one open) and was 3rd in line. The old lady who was being served 1st in line was taking forever (as the elderly sometimes do.) Anyways, the line grows to about 5 more behind me. Finally, a second cashier opened up and took the 2nd in line customer, making me next.

The old lady was still talking about gift delivery or something when the second cashier was ready. She scanned the book and, low and behold, it was $29.99. No problem, I thought. Pulled out the trusty smartphone, still on THEIR webpage, and thought I was going to be price matched Best Buy style. Nope. ""We don't price match,"" said the cashier. I told her it was their own website. ""We don't price match even our own website.""

Almost laughing at the ridiculousness of waiting 10 minutes in line to hear that, I simply dropped the book on the counter, then bounced out to the car where I went on-line to AMAZON and bought the same book. For $18.84, by the way. Would have gladly given B&N the $19.99.

Anyways, I can assure you that not only will I never return to this moronic establishment, but I will also spread the word to everyone. So long B&N. We hardly knew ya!",2

On top of that, it has an extremely pleasant atmosphere and the staff act like true hosts and want you to enjoy your visit to their establishment.  I have read some of the previous reviews and find the main critics to be several types of quiblers.  Haveli offers a good variety of nicely prepared North Indian dishes with much emphasis on chicken options.  All of them are quite good.  Not heavy on the heat spicing, but if you want that, don't go to the buffet, as most people can't handle the eye watering stuff. The goat dish and the Bharta had enough heat to be noticeable, but most did not.  There were some really nice vegetable offerings.  The only thing we missed was a dal.

We stumbled onto Haveli a couple of weeks ago as we began to use McKee Road again.  It's only been there for a little over a year.  Took family with four adults and two small kids for buffet lunch and were not disappointed in any way.  This will become our new ""Go To"" Indian from now on.

11408,3,1549238400000,"Claudia was our cashier.  She was condescending and unhelpful throughout and at the end she charged US for THEIR mistake. We ordered a chili cheese and a bacon Mac and paid for them. When the guy making our order started he asked if we wanted to add toppings before the bacon and cheese. I was confused and clarified multiple times that it was chili&cheese and bacon&mac, no combination of bacon &cheese. Each time he just said he got it but did we want toppings first. We told him the toppings and then when he made it with cheese instead of Mac we told him it was wrong. We said it was fine to just add Mac so they didn't have to redo it. We did this to be nice and easy, so they didn't have to do extra work and throw away the whole hot dog. I explained that that was what I meant when I was explaining earlier and they said no, that was not what happened rudely and condescendingly. Then we decided to add a sauce flight. There were 4 types listed, and we read the 3 we wanted. There was confusion over chipotle ranch and if it was 1 or 2 toppings (chipotle ranch(1) OR ranch and chipotle (2 separate toppings). They were laughing at us and acting like we were stupid because it was unclear on the sign.  We finally picked the 3 we wanted. Then we gave Claudia the card to ring us up for the extra $1.50. She took the card and announced ""$3.24"" as she was swiping. I'm pretty sure, from the smirk on her face and how quickly she swiped it, not checking the total first, she knew that we would not be pleased with being charged extra for their mistake. I told her that that was ridiculous to charge us for them messing up the hot dog. She just said ""I already charged it, and it was for the extra toppings you got so i can't change it"" (completely without remorse). I did not order that extra cheese, it was put on my order without my asking for it, and for some reason she charged us extra for chili too, which was only on the chili&cheese, and was already paid for in our original transaction. I don't care about the $1.74, but I care about customer service and she had none. She and the guy argued with us about our order and never apologized or tried to make sure we felt taken care of. I have honestly never received such bad customer service in my life. I've never been treated with such hostility at a restaurant. I hope you give your employees some proper training. If they mess up, they should not charge the customer for it, and they certainly should not do it sneakily like she did. They should apologize when a mistake is made and own it, not blame the customer. I'm just so disappointed in my experience and we will never be back or recommend it to our friends.

With our stinky credit we knew going in that we'd need a sizable down payment. We were prepared to put down 60% of the new Nissan Rogue price, with no trade in. You'd think the finance dept. would care. Nope. Not even the courtesy of a return phone call to numerous messages that we left for two different people. Ok. So maybe you can't get us financed, tell us. Call us, pester us. Try to sell us a used car that we can pay for 100% in cash. Don't you guys want to move inventory? Make commissions? Nope. Oh and 4 days after the dust blizzard every car was still coated in dirt. Just tells you that Coulter Nissan really does not car about selling cars.

Oh and one more scandalous thing....we printed their ad from cars.com and brought it in. Sales guy takes the printout to ""the finance person"" and then brings out a new one with the real price, $500 more. He said that price was good only thru the 4th of July weekend, but nowhere in the ad was that stated. We were there on the 7th.

The perfect weather did make such the difference. We had a table for 5 outside and it was perfect! The drink and menu options are great!  A small menu but a very good mix if things.

First round of drinks I had the sangria which the flower in it just gave it that little extra something to make you feel like you were on a tropical island somewhere...it's the little things!  2nd round was the basil martini which was delicious.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced.  I would have had more if I wasn't driving :)

Food was really good! My favorite was the macadamia goat cheese! Fish tacos and plantain chips were yummy too. I plan to go back and get the poke and the sliders, which others in my party said the sliders were really good, I was just too full! But always have room for dessert and when they brought out the dessert tray, had to try the creme brûlée in the pineapple.  Not only was it pretty and tropical looking but was amazing!  Never had that mix, glad we did and will definitely get it again!  We scraped the bottom!

I wouldn't have minded sitting inside because the guitar player Justin is amazing! I didn't realize he played there but saw him one day when I was passing through the restaurant.  He happen to be the musician I got to play at my sisters wedding. I saw him at a friends wedding and had to book him.  So glad I know where I can catch him play!

Even though I didn't get the enthusiastic greeting that everybody else received, the guy behind the counter at about 7:30pm did eventually give me some samples of one meat and that jalapeno cream cheese too. The cream cheese and both of the salsa's at the salsa bar were all in the hot category, even the green one that normally is mild. Go for the pico de Gallo if you don't like things too hot like myself. The beef in red sauce also had a hefty kick, but the chicken was composed of huge chunks of white meat that the cook put back on the grill before piling it atop my custom made burrito that was in progress.

1. Chipotle tortilla (choice of 4 others too)
2. Roasted Corn to put inside the burrito
3. Homemade Horchata
4. Free Homemade Chips with your order

I was curious, then, about a joint that offers dairy-free soft serve and milkshakes. I decided to go with their Banana Bread soft serve, and watched as the helpful clerk mixed it up from scratch.

It's...fine. For what it is, it's probably better than average. It's got a rich banana flavor and it definitely grew on me as I was eating it. But it's a far cry from actual ice cream, ultimately. It's rather thick and chunky, and it's missing that creaminess one tends to expect from soft serve. (It's pretty expensive, too.)

The bar doesn't have a TV.  Not sure if this is good or bad but if you want to catch the game and eat some wings or bbq while doing so, you might have to do it on the patio.

The bistecca large place was the absolute best. Tender and served with roasted shallots and mashed potatoes. 
I could go on and on but the food and drinks were beyond fantastic!

We were seated right away at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs were more than accommodating to us. They explained different types of sushi to us, carried on a conversation and taught us a lot that we didn't know. Our waiter was very attentive too, and had our refills ready to go in the blink of an eye. Now, we haven't been back in like a year or so, I don't know how the service is now or if it has changed at all since we've been when they were newer, but our experience was great!
We got a private tour from one of the owners that was so proud and happy to show us the whole building. He took us up the old school elevator to the multiple floors above the hibachi ground floor. There was a hooka bar on one floor, a dance club on another. It was crazy to see how much you could take advantage of in one building.

They were pretty tasty and even better when I requested some marinara to dip them in! I had the fagottino di parma, a pasta with cream sauce wrapped in prosciutto. Very delicious but it was not something I could eat too much of - very rich, creamy and salty. The service was decent, not terrible but could've been better.

It was fairly busy, so getting the bartender's attention was a challenge.  While I was waiting, I noticed the Lobster Zone game, which is just so depressing that I almost left before I even picked up my order.

It's too dark inside for me to comment fairly on cleanliness, but I did catch wind of an odor that I can only describe as sweaty.

As for the pizza, it was nothing special at all.  The sauce was OK, but the burnt crust and virtually tasteless toppings conspired to ruin my pizza.

I was a little annoyed that when I went to make reservations they said I wouldn't need them so not to worry but when we arrived and it was pretty empty  I of course asked for a booth to which I was told ""the booth section is currently closed"". I decided to just accept the table that was given since we were already planning to see a show and either way it was empty. The wide array of choices is interesting yet somewhat pricey. I ordered the orange chicken which was great but the portion wasn't exactly worth the price. I also ordered a crunch roll which was actually some of the best sushi I have had in awhile. The soda/tea that were ordered were priced at $3 each with the soda coming in a regular can with a glass of ice on the side (free refills but still $3!!!). All in all the food was great, ambience was okay, service could use a little work and the pricing is reasonable.

I usually get the shrimp and crab tortellini. It has the perfect amount of spice in the red pepper cream sauce. 
Oh, and the homemade balsamic dressing for the salads is the bomb! 
Two small cons: the service isn't very fast. Be prepared to spend at least 2 hours at the restaurant during your visit. At this point, I expect it so I plan accordingly. Also, they will NOT do separate checks. If you go with a group, they won't take more than 4 credit cards for one check- so try to bring cash!

This is my go to spot for a movie because it's convenient and the south point hotel is never to packed , free parking, the clientele is more mature so there is never any problems, and they have some great affordable restaurants that you can eat at before or after the movie and they even have a hot dog cart if your there before 5:30pm that sells $1.50 hot dogs which is perfect to take into a movie lol.

  For starters, the place is easy to miss. It's a hole in the wall. It's very small inside, only a few tables; definitely consider takeout.

   That said, if it's not busy, don't be afraid to stay. We ate in; when there was a significant lull in the crowd, the girl behind the counter came both to clear our tables and to deliver a second item I ordered a bit later in the evening. I wish I'd been carrying cash, there is a tip jar by the register, and I would have loved to have left something for that.

   The food...ah, the food. Great bang for the buck. Have I had better tacos? Yes. Once, handmade by a Mexican immigrant my mother was good friends with, as we joined her for a family dinner. In restaurants? No. This is good Mexican street food, small hand made corn tortillas with flavorful, moist meat on them, and some warm salsa on top. Lovely. They even offer lengua, for those that like it, a very nice touch.

   As others have said, the rice is very good; I wasn't actually that fond of the beans though.

The ad boasted about how management had just made a lot of improvements and upgrades to the apartments . Though the buildings were old, the inside was updated so I signed a lease.  I moved in May of 2015 and the first morning I was there I woke up to a BED BUG in my bed! I reported this to the office staff who, after some delay, scheduled a treatment for the beginning of June. After that, I had to call the city in to have my floor reinforced and to have my patio door properly sealed. I submitted requests and emailed the manager about my issues and nothing got done.In September, I again woke up to a BED BUG crawling on my sheets. I immediately contacted the office and took in the bug. I had to demand something be done this time even though I had several visible bites. I also found out that my neighbors were also having bed bug issues! I finally sent a letter demanding treatment and that I be released from my lease.

So since we were in Vegas, we decided to give Mastros Ocean Club a try.  We were not disappointed.  The restaurant is located in the City Center shopping area and fits in well with the high end shopping and the swanky décor of the city center and surrounding hotels.  The décor is simple contemporary.  It would be too simple if it wasn't for their amazing bar set up but more their ""tree house"" structure.  If you visit Mastros, request that you sit in the tree house section.  They also have a lounge singer and piano player.  The volume was fine (as I've read other review that it was extremely loud) - but we were sitting in the tree house area so I can imagine if you had one of the tables next to the singer or in the booths behind them, it would be pretty loud.  Regardless, the singer was very good and sang songs from all genres.  Now to the important part - the food.  Everything we ordered was amazing.  As all higher end restaurants, all sides are ala cart but big enough to share.  Our entrees were delishous - ahi tuna, sea bass, and scallops.  I have no complaints, all were cooked PERFECTLY and extremely flavorful.  The portions were quite large.  The sides were equally amazing and big enough to share between 3-4 people.  One of the sides - the mac and cheese was AH. MAZ. ING.  If we're ever back I'd be happy to dive into the Lobster mashed potatoes.  The wedge salad was enourmous, enough to share between 2 people.  I had the lobster bisque which was very tasty.  I've had it before at other places and it sometimes has had a ""fishy"" taste but not this. And there were big chunks of lobster.

I had a reservation with Payless but when I got to there, Payless had a very long line. Although it was expected since Payless was the cheapest you can get online. So I decided to just try to get a quote from Advantage right there and then and got a cheaper deal. Was upgraded to a Rav4 as well. Their vehicles are recent models. Great car rental experience. Will definitely use the company again. Every rental company is different. Advantage will require you to provide the following: Valid Driver's license of course, Credit card, and a proof of car insurance(even if you're buying their insurance). I don't know if you can rent from them if you don't have a car insurance. They never asked for utility bills though like other rental companies do.",1

There is no reason on earth that a major worldwide chain should not take American Express period.

They started by pulling 2 tables together (to seat 8) and we tried to explain that we would need more room. Finally a manager came out and made the decision to seat us at a table more accommodating as our last 2 showed up.
Took a while for the waiter to take our food order and then he spilled a glass of water on one of us.

11755,1,1548979200000,"Worst ever!!!! At the time of check in the young woman was obviously flustered with good cause, lack of managment support. We reserved a handicap room my BF is a paraplegic. The front desk gal was running back and forth to try and figure out how to get us the room needed. After 30 minutes of her running around with no support help we got our room. ( not what we needed) but partially. We requested additional pillows they never came. We called for room service that was advertised, no longer offered. We called Snaps restaurant to place a ""togo"" order, after 33 minutes of waiting to see if they would do it the answer was, we dont do it anymore. So my BF that is wheelchair bound insisted to go down and order and get the food. In fact he did. Prime rib was to be medium, it was horrid absolutely terrible more than well done. The next day we left and asked to have our room cleaned only half of the room was done my phone charger was missing bathroom not touched, i asked yet again for additional pillows nope!! Each morning i went to get 3 large coffees one oatmeal sourdough toast and a fruit platter. I now noticed i was charged differently both days. I was so aggravated about the charger missing i went to the front desk and complained. I was given one night free, i asked is there possibly a charger i can borrow or possibly one in lost and found.? No go to the gift shop, I did! I bought a charger for 8$, i could not see threw the plastic it looked correct. I opened it and it was an iphone charger, i took it back to be told sorry she could not refund 8.00 until her manager came in at 1pm. This woman had been working there for over 20 years and unable to refund. WTH???? This was it!!! The hits just kept coming. Staff was rude no one was welcoming or accommodating. It was NO!! on all attempts. Oh the night that was comped ended up canceling a night an additional issue. I WILL NEVER EVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL EVER AGAIN!!!!!!",3
11755,2,1550534400000,"I bought my wedding dress here. I thought what a great opportunity. I can get a great deal on a nice designer dress. What I didn't know was that there were some strings attached which included delayed delivery dates, poor service, no phone call backs, and getting the wrong thing when I ordered something different. 

So my story with this business starts when I bought my dress. I was quoted 4-6 months for my dress to arrive .when six months came I had not heard anything so I called the company and they said it should be arriving in the next two weeks. Well two weeks came and went and I didnt hear anything so I called again. They told me any day now it should be in. A week past and no word. So this time I went into the store to get an answer, while at the store I was told my dress wasn't suppose to come in until aug. Which is 1 year after I ordered it. I told that would not work because I was quoted earlier and I needed it for alterations. So after me dealing with them I lost all my patience so
My wedding planner called and she was ignored so finally my mother called and threatened credit card fraud because she had put down half for this dress and we had nothing to show for the huge sum of money we had paid. Bottom line they had charged our card and we had nothing to show for it and none of the promises they said were being followed thru with. After eight months I finally got my dress. All I can't say is I am happy i planned so far in advance. 

 I also ordered a veil from them and when I went to pick it up it was a completely wrong. It was nothing like what i ordered . At this point all I wanted was my money back for the veil,

Before the veil came in my fiancé, groomsmen, and fathers went to ordered their tux. They had no idea how to measure them. It was a group of seven and they had to wait 20 mins before anyone even helped them. They had put the deposit down for the tux but to be honest I am so tired of dealing with them that I am going to walk away from my deposit money and take my business else where. 

My advice for anyone thinking of going here for anything----- DON'T. It will give you a huge headache. Paying a little more at another store is very much worth it in the long run.",2

I try to avoid the brunch rush when I go, it's definitely doable!  The front has a nice coffeehouse vibe to it, but there are a few tables nestled in a narrow area out back, and this is where I've always ended up seated.  It's not especially well-decorated back there, but it's cozy.  

Although there are a lot of tempting things on the menu, I always opt for the curried chicken salad sandwich.  Maybe one of these days I'll branch out and try something else, but that sandwich is way too delicious to pass up!",2

11764,1,1550275200000,"I really enjoyed my stay at Elara. I always heard really good things about it back when it was PH Towers from friends that were regular guests. Now I know why they liked it so much. To me Elara has the best of both worlds. It can be a low key & semi-private Las Vegas hotel resort or if you walk a little ways through the Miracle Mile shops which connect the Elara to the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino, you get your standard Vegas experience. 

We stayed in a corner 2-bedroom 2 full bath suite on the 8th floor which overlooked the Elara pool. I loved the spaciousness of this suite. The kitchen was big, the living room was huge & the dining table easily sat 6-8 people. Of course, everyone knows about the drop down projector screen. It was great for watching the NBA games that weekend. It was WIDE.... I liked how we had pots, pans, utensils & dishes to cook our own breakfast in the morning. The fridge was spacious enough to hold all our groceries from Vons & Whole Foods for the weekend. The beds were comfortable. 40""+ LCD televisions in each room were pretty standard. Th pull-out sofa bed was room enough for two and the big sofa it came out of can probably sleep another 2 adults on it. The bathrooms were spacious. Double sinks in the master bath. Modern style & dark wood paneling... The showers were my favorite, especially the master bath shower. 2 big rain shower heads in a humongous space. Of course I would turn both on, having one cooler in the front & one warmer on your back. It was like a water massage.... no joke. Nice dark brown tile in the shower. Nice modern look. I really liked it... It also had this chaise lounge chair that faced the corner of the suite... all glass, tall windows that gave a 180 degree view of the strip & Harmon Ave. It was my favorite place to lounge & power nap. Never mind that it was tiger striped & orange on the side. It was the best chair!! I miss it! ha!

Master bedroom had a jacuzzi tub right outside the bathroom area near the window. It also had a separate semi-private toilet area with a bidet. Yes, I used it.. haha. It had a decent sized walk-in closet that also housed the safe. The TV in that room was on an island that house the dresser drawers.

Pool was great. More chill than your typical Vegas pool because PH guests are no longer allowed to crash. Fine by me... I can actually find a lounge chair and get in the water. Big fan of the Elara pool.

Service was friendly. Our housekeeper wanted to wash our dirty dishes but we were more than capable of washing our own plates and pans. They really try to go that extra mile at the Elara... I also liked how strict the security was at Elara as far as access to the hotel guest elevators go. I appreciate that because I don't know about you but when I'm in my room and I'm trying to sleep, I don't wanna hear any unnecessary commotion out in the hallway. Granted our suite was all the way at the end of the hall.. but still. Some quite is appreciated in hectic Las Vegas.

Valet is $15 a day. I wasn't a fan of that, so I valet'd our rental van at the Miracle Mile Shops valet. Not too many people valet there. Most go to PH valet so it's kind of like an unknown thing. All you need to do is tip... Car is brought to you in less than 1 minute. That's huge for me... They are open 24 hours Thurs-Sat, I believe... otherwise they open at 10am after closing at midnight. Don't quote me but I think that's pretty close. Signs are posted so I would double check.",2

Saw this restaurant and decided this is the place. They had pizza, pasta, and sandwiches. They even had some Luncheon Specials too. Nice portions, and price was great too. It was nice not eating on Fremont for a change. Of course I order the pasta with garlic bread and splash it on my clean shirt. Oh well it is not the first time doing that.

We went mid-day for lunch on a Monday and loved our experience. The food was lovely and our server was nice enough to comp our desserts and affogato for us.

I strongly recommend my dish the lobster ravioli over my friend's tricolore gnocchi (and I rarely say that about potato dishes ever) simply because the pink vodka ravioli sauce is to die for! Spongebob and Plankton knew what they were talking about when they said that ravioli secrets were worth fighting for.

Cautionary tale that their desserts are no joke in size, with cream puffs the size of saucers and truffles richer than Donald Trump. Honestly, it's like these desserts got their degrees and went back for grad school. Then to top off our visit, their affogatos were a great balance of creamy and bitter deliciousness.

There was simply no downside to our visit, I would definitely like to come back soon to try their carvery entrees.",2

The food is very good although I did have a bad experience with the Uncle Buck tacos last night as the oysters were severely undercooked. Like total mush. I've gotten these several times but they were just cooked wrong last night. The drinks are seriously overpriced but they are good, just not worth $9.75 for a tiny cocktail.  Normally the service has been OK but last night we finally had to get up and ask the host to get a waitress to come over to our table after sitting there for 15 minutes with our menus.

Oh man, I am literally making my mouth water just by thinking of that dish (dapanji) made of tender chicken, flat and wide handmade noodle (west China style), as well as some random supplementary vegetables like potatoes, bell peppers, scallion, n onions etc. It is an Uyghur restaurant, and Uyghur is an ethnic group mainly dwelling in the west part of China and mid Asia. Most Uyghur are Muslim, so the food this restaurant serves is Halal. 

Besides their signature dish Dapanji, there are 2 more stuffs I would like to strongly encourage foodies to give a shot. One is the cumin-spiced lamb skewer. Another one is the ""Naan"" (made from flour). In general, none of the stuffs i have tried there so far disappointed me.

So there's bean sprouts, rice noodles, thinly sliced steak, but of course you've got over a dozen configurations. All ingredients were fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed stirring them into the broth, which I assume was scalding enough to do serious damage if mishandled. 

They paired well with a refreshing cabbage spring roll, made complete with thin slivers of pork sausage. I have never heard of sausage in Vietnamese food, but still, I'd definitely eat again. I loved the chili sauce it came with, and my only complaint was my broth not having enough of a kick.

It doesn't matter what time you go to Tony's, it seems it is always packed. The parking lot is always full, the tables are all taken, and there's a sizable line. But that's how you know it's so good. 

I've never had the actual food from here, it didn't look that great, so this review is for the ice cream only. Their milkshakes are the absolute best. They basically make a milkshake with the ice cream and then add extra ice cream to the made milkshake. It's basically half ice cream, half milkshake in a cup and I'm not sure why but this is awesome.

It may sound weird, but get the grape milkshake. I was skeptical at first too, but I haven't looked back since I first tried it. It's the best. 

If you're in the area, definitely stop in for some Tony's ice cream. It's awesome.",1

Their boba smoothies are on point too. Perfect sweetness. Flavors are on point. Tapioca balls are nice and soft.

When I want to save the sandwiches for later, I usually ask them for the veggies on the side!

Filled out the customary paperwork and waited. As I returned the paperwork, a familiar face down the hallway said, ""hello."" It was Dr. Beecroft. Hmmm, I saw him four years ago...does he remember me?  

The staff at the counter and in the exam room were both excellent and friendly. New faces, though.  They hire the best people!  

When he saw me in the exam room, Dr.  Beecroft said he did indeed remember me, not my name or what he'd seen me for, but he remembered where I work and the goal of getting me on my feet (literally) for a busy fall semester. That's amazing!  I've never had a doc with that kind of memory and I told him so. 

He skillfully conducted the exam using an ultrasound machine, showed me what was going on, and very gently gave an injection to reduce inflammation. We discussed the treatment plan moving forward and frankly, that's what I love. Sharing the plan with me is key to my recovery, right?

Would we return, yes...any restaurant has bad nights and mistakes.  And we love the bar.  I understand Annie's has a wonderful Happy Hour.  We will check it out.",2

Chef Holly offers plenty of good, solid Southwest fare as well as some more innovative plates. The calamari is outstanding, as are the huge dinner salads. The staff are friendly and efficient. The drink specials are tough to resist. All of the food is worth trying. Do yourself a favor and drop in on the weekend for their brunch. The huevos rancheros are to die for.

Take  the screechy, adolescent rant left by a certain reviewer with a large grain of salt...it smells of personal vendetta and a need for attention.",2

My mom got us a groupon for here. Super cute inside! We got sat right away and drink orders taken quickly. Our server, Maryann, what a doll!! She took such great care of us, was super sweet and fun! Food could have been crap and still would give 5 stars cause I'm so all about that customer service, and Maryann has it! But, luckily the food wasn't crap! It was bomb! I'm not a meat eater but now and again I'll have tuna. Their tuna melt is the best!!!!! Real tuna, melted perfect cheese and the parmesan sour dough??? Lawdy!!! Perfect! Seasoned fries are great too!!! My mom had a Bloody Mary and said it was the real deal! We loved everything about our experience here!",2

We were welcomed with delicious breads and soft butter, and a server who was very smart, very detail-oriented, and also had a great sense of humor, which suited our group of 4 perfectly.  I was almost ""steak-ed"" out since coming to Vegas for a birthday weekend, so I ordered the chicken.  I was NOT disappointed.  The skin was crackling crisp and deliciously seasoned. The chicken meat was amazingly tender and juicy.  All of us, including a french woman were thoroughly impressed with our dishes.  Desserts were amazing, too.  I would recommend Bouchon to anyone looking for a 4-5 star meal at a very reasonable price in Vegas.  Great for special occasions in general...",2

For luxurious weekend lounging, this is lush. Velvety bench seating, oversized photos of beautiful horses, cool retro fixtures and dark comfortable interior design make this one of Calgary's best delicious lil lounges. Dress posh. Pose pretty.

But oh my pretty lil posie, you must have some decent disposable cash to look good here. Martinis will run you $12 but their classic margarita martini (made to order) was only second to Ming's and the Toasted Almond was good dessert fun.
This is tapas stylings and we appeased our palettes with some delightful melted gruyere cheese and herb bread, pork taquitos and the chef's platter which, that night (at $20 a person) included walnut, blue cheese and pear salad, butter prawns, lamb pate with cranberry bread chips and seared steak on mushroom risotto. The latter was to die for.

Ingrid was an amazing server, extremely responsive and attentive. Highly recommend the yellowtail hamachi as well as the yellowtail sushi. Both were fresh and intensely rich.

12009,2,1551052800000,"It's hard to describe what this restaurant means to me. It's like a pair of long, forgotten, but great-at-that shoes; When in season I would wear it everyday, but once the hype had passed, the shoes are stored away collecting dust, with a once-in-a-while-pull-out.

Well, Peking man is that pair of shoes. I used to come here often in my younger years (like single digit age) and the dumplings and Shanghai noodles were THE BEST. It was really the only acceptable restaurant where you could eat dumplings and white bread with condensed milk. Now, with Ding Tai Fung, Asian Legends and the variety of restaurants serving dumplings at First Markham, Peking Man has almost been forgotten. For those who have frequented here often, the dark, pink wallpaper still exists, as well as the cloth curtains collecting dust, faux plants and Christmas lights decorating the ceiling, and yes, that one Arcade machine with the motorcylce priced at an 1980's inflation rate of 25 cents. It really hasn't caught up with the times, but to its credit, it is still standing.

Food is still as good as I remember. Some of my family members came here for dinner last night and I had a craving for meat dumplings and Shanghai noodles with crunchy vegetables. However, that is the lunch menu. Dinner options are much more extensive and we had an extra large bowl of Hot and Sour Soup. Now, I normally don't like that soup, but at this place it was SO TASTY. I had 5 bowls of this jolt-in-your place liquid and the flavouring was delish.

Then, we had an assortment of dishes including fried pork cutlets, fried green beans, tofu, beef and onion, Chicken with sprinkled garlic and for me, vegetarian dumplings (but no meat). All good.

Reservations aren't really needed, although as soon as we came in, 3 big families came in and turned our quiet area into a zoo. 

I will always love this restaurant as a place of my childhood, but the food is great too. It's not fine dining and the service is off and on, but I hope Peking Man will stick around for my children to enjoy as well.",2

12033,1,1549411200000,"Loved the vibe of this place, right when I walked in, it had hipster written all over it!  I was in Charlotte for a work trip so I easily snagged a spot at the bar.  The place was packed on a Saturday night, they had this great covered outdoor patio area with a bar outside.  Looked like a great place to hang out.

First off, I get it, it's busy on a Saturday night and I am by myself but it took a very long time to get service.  Definitely why I knocked down this place a star.  I decided to order the carchuittere plate and the fried green tomatoes.  I also had to get a beer, I got the local brewed one and loved it!  The carchurittere plate was very nice, I did wish it had one more soft cheese to it but the meat selection was great.  I am a sucker for fried green tomatoes and this one had a cornmeal crust to it so it was thick and hot off the fryer when I had it.  With the sauce it was a great little dish.

I literally had to ask two times, ""are you sure this isn't meat?""  That shizznit is too legit!!

SO down to the facts, 
China Town. 
2nd floor above the market.  
I kinda struggled a wee bit to find this gem, since I don't read Mandarin.
Not a bad place to actually eat. Sometimes, when you find a diamond, it's in the ROUGH, realllll ROUGH.  They have a large selection to choose from...my personal fave so far General Tao - I salute thee.  And the Orange Beef is palette pleasing too!

It has sheepskin, rabbit fur, a (relatively) indestructible ball, AND a long bungee handle. This thing is amazing. Dogs go absolutely ballistic over it and can't get enough. 
Leave it to the owner (Caida) and her fantastic staff to bring in the products that we dog-lovers will absolutely adore. Not only that, but the selection of food and food toys (like Nina Ottosson) is astounding. 
It's nice to go to a pet store where the staff is knowledgable and the products are humane. You'll notice that they don't promote/push shock collars, prong and choke collars and other torture devices. They have a focus on dog-safe tools and equipment and are quick to recommend highly effective products. 
There's a great vibe about this place. Definitely one of the best pet stores in Toronto. Plus, it's gorgeous in there! I love the new Pet Valu look! I can't wait to bring Parker in there for a bath when the soggy weather gets...soggier. The facilities are clean and spacious.

I wasn't expecting this, but agreed since we needed to finish the job. The last two gentleman who came to join the crew were phenomenal! Things began to move very quickly, and I have to give the crew a great deal of credit for taking care of our items. Everything was carefully wrapped, and our 70 inch TV was secured in their own van.

Food is generally very fresh.  Pretty good dynamite roll, tempura appetizer, banana fritters for dessert.  I always miss the lunch specials b/c of the time of my work lunch or would've tried that long ago.  So it forces me into getting two a la carte items, usually two of the three above, since I don't want to spend $19.99 on the dinner combo.  Then again, my bill usually comes to around $17 after taxes, so it's 20 by the time I tip.  

Service is 90% of the time very friendly and stereotypical of the many Japanese restaurants I've been at in Toronto.  All smiles, politeness, female-only, dressed in cultural style.  Usually they are quite attentive, making sure the complimentary green tea is topped up, your food is good, etc.  A few times I had to wait very long, which I attribute to them being short staffed maybe?  The place is never really busy when I go, often three or four tables occupied inside, and if it's the summer, one or two outside are taken on the patio.  I always prefer the patio if it's nice out, as you can watch planes taking off from the city airport.

We came here on a Friday night after dinner and there was only one other table occupied. The fact we came from a nearby bar type restaurant blasting music with loud chatter, to this place was such a drastic and pleasant change. 

Anyways, there was hangul outside so I did think it was a Korean place but don't be fooled as this is a Taiwanese dessert place. They're really going for that sailor/at sea concept here. And I just have to say the plates/bowls and everything was just so bizarre.

I went with the mango sago and while it wasn't bad, it wasn't anything special. But they did use real pomelo, mango, and coconut so, that's a plus.  

Service could have a been more polished. Waitresses showed just overall inexperience in terms of lack of knowledge for some things. Like who ordered what, and what was actually being served. There was confusion when one of my friends got something called an ice mountain with ice cream. And it ended up being the exact same thing I ordered, but just with ice cream. So what happened was the first thing served was the mango sago (with ice cream) and I thought it was mine because it's mango sago.. and then another one was served and we were all confused and no one knew what was going on. Turns out that was suppose to be the mango sago. Maybe it's just our fault but they were nice enough to give a scoop of ice cream for my friend's order. It's not a big deal overall. 

But if you're looking for something in the area for something that's different, maybe you can come here.",1

Service in our case were really nice, and prompt.
The bad was the ambiance and the food.

Music is blasting through a little crummy Ipod/Radio,
Food was really upsetting. Ive had some amazing cheese platters for around the same price range, but they were generally very generous with the jams/pickles/breads, etc. For over $20, they supply you with some toast, and some rosemary ""wonder bread"", with a half teaspoon of some jams and mustard. 2pc poorly executed pickled green beans, and some dissected grapes. Sorry, big fail. Cheese was nice however. 

Could have had better olives from Loblaws... Smoked olives... more like flash grilled olives... 

Too bad. Was looking forward to this place.",2
12159,3,1549497600000,"Sadly I've lived in Chandler for almost 10 years and had yet to give Barro's a try. Ended up grabbing some dinner for my family yesterday. We ordered the 6 honey bbq wings, medium pizza (ham and pineapple), and the garlic bread. The pizza was delicious and cooked really well. There was a good amount of toppings (unlike other places where they skimp on the toppings), and the crust we all loved (especially my son who just kept asking for the crust haha). The wings sauce was good and the fry was also good however we did have a piece that seemed like it was over fried (almost too crispy and a bit dry) but 5/6 is still good in my book. Lastly, the garlic bread was probably the lowlight of the meal. The garlic sauce was good, but the bread itself seemed like it was old and dry.

Overall, I'll give Barro's a try again but will try and pray the garlic bread is fresh :).",1

They even let me wait inside away from the cold a couple of times... Afraid that this was only a ""weird sea-food place,"" no offense, it had not really occurred to me to go there before. But, once I had the chance, a couple weeks ago, I grabbed it: I went in a party of 5 (myself, included), and we had the most delicious meal with the typical to the unusual: Miso, or soy-based soup with algae and onions skimming the top of it; as well as my all-time favorite: pan-fried noodles. Yum Yum!!! :DDDDD

Nothing could be better than those two menu items...Oh, and the waiters, were friendly, they were knowledgeable, of course, and they also were patient and served hot tea for a very low fee. This place's for me!!! :)

We were ""helped"" by Benjamin at the front desk (he really needs to freshen up on his customer service skills) we asked if we could possibly get two conjoining rooms and without even looking he rudely said no and that they were all sold out. And that if we wanted rooms on even the same floor we had to wait for them to be cleaned. Okay, that's fine. 3 hours later and after checking with them 3 different times our rooms were finally ready. And we ended up with conjoining rooms, which is cool but it would have been nice for Benjamin to check his computer before telling us that it wasn't possible. One of our rooms still had dirty towels from the last guests who stayed there. (Weird because it took 3 hours to get it cleaned) The Bathroom fan sounded like it was going to explode out of the wall. And more than once there wasn't any hot water, not even Luke warm. They only allow 2 devices to be connected to the WiFi and it didn't even work.

AAA filet mingnon with sauteed mushrooms - it was divine. The meat was cooked with perfection.
Mini tuna burguer - not so ""mini"" actually. To me it was a full size burguer. It was light and very tasty.
Goat cheese salad with pine nuts and strawberry vinagrette - very light and delicious salad, and the warm goat cheese really gave it a special touch.
Manchego cheese and nut foundue - I guess I was expecting something different, but I was not very impressed. By the time I got to that dish, the cheese was hard and just didn't do anything for me.

Having traveled in Germany and Austria, one develops an appreciation for schnitzel. For those who haven't had a chance to visit the land of beer and quality engineering, schnitzel is pork that has been flattened so that it is evenly thin and very crispy when fried. Schnitzel is supposed to be the size of your dinner plate with maybe an accompaniment of some fries or veggies. WURST's rendition makes a mockery of Germany's greatest food. Between the 3 schnitzels ordered, there may have been 6oz of meat. That is an average of 2 ounces per disk for ~$25 a person. For that price, I should be eating caviar rather than pork. 

The beer is good and comes in German sized steins (get the 1 or 2L). You are definitely paying for the experience of drinking in a beer hall though as 1L mugs will run you ~$20 with 2L steins at ~$30.

We all ended up going upstairs to the bar, and I was impressed with the decor from walking in.  Very sheek, modern designs.  Cool bar stools, and a moving screen with lights behind it that was fun to look at.  Its a more narrow area for the bar, and slightly larger area for seating.  There was plenty of seating avaiable, but it was very casual...couches and benches and the such.

We went to the bar, and ordered a few drinks.  I looked at thier drink menu, and realized that it was alcohol only.  NO FOOD whatsover here!  No appitizers or anything.  So, if your hungry, you need to pick something up before hand.  I hope they add something to eat here, even if its light food.  

The Bartender was a very nice lady.  It seemed that they (or at least this bartender) was pretty cool about making stuff on and off the menu.  They didnt have a martini list, so I made up my own!  how cool is that??

It was okay, if a little bit on the bland side, and the protein powder seemed pretty weak relative to other smoothies I've had that usually have that boost.

I don't recognize any of the staff at the College street location, unlike the original location but that's OK.  The wings are consistent as are the multi-level of sauces.  For anyone who has never been to Duff's, even if you think you can handle spicy hotness, beware of Death and Armaggedon - it will not only kill your tastebuds, you'll be living in the bathroom shortly after putting the wing on your tongue.  

The ambience is definitely a bit more sport bar-like so be prepared to jump out of your skin when the Leafs score if your eyes aren't glued to the many TVs.  A warning that they are pretty high up so prepare also for possible neck strain.  

Duff's consistency:  check!  Yummy and pretty large wings: check!  Good service:  check!

With the current success of these owners (UNA, Ox&Angela), and should the music hold up, I predict Commonwealth will have a long and healthy life complete with loyal followers.

The beef was a little heavy on the lime, but other than that it was amazing. I can't recall having a mint and lime leaf salad before this... But I would definitely have it again. 

Add in the very modern, upscale decor and you've got a winner on your hands.",2

There is one major thing, though, that the Pho enthusiast would take major exception to, and should know before entering.  They don't put bottles of hoisin and Sriracha on the table. They insist on bringing you tiny sauce ramekins instead with your pho.  And if you want more, you have to ask for them...one...by...one, which the server brings to you each time more begrudgingly and grouchily than the next.   I understand that perhaps the restaurant is going for a ""nicer"" look and thus doesn't want to crowd the table with condiment bottles, but it comes off as miserly portion-control (You shouldn't be trying to save money on Sriracha and plum sauce; these are MAIN staples of Pho, like ketchup to a french fry). 

As for the Pho itself, it's a bit pricier than the usual, but when I tried it, it hit the spot, for the most part.  The broth was slightly sweeter than one would expect, but the noodles, vegetables and beef were prepared to standard.",2

Sweet Pea and our two neighbors rsvp'd yes right away when the invitation for a free brunch came in our mailboxes, although the invitation was scant on details, and we were not sure what to expect.  Was there a price limit?  Drinks included?  We didn't know, we didn't really care.  Always up to discover a new restaurant downtown, we took the rail and settled in to a large, cushy booth for an adventure.
This place is the place I think will give Hanny's a run for it's money.  It's not as chic as Hanny's, no.  It's got that open kitchen, central bar kind of big city vibe.  This is a restaurant that you could be at in Seattle, San Francisco, New York.  The cool thing about Fox Restaurants is that they each do have their own unique concept, and this is no different.
We all ordered our drinks and perused the menu.  Breakfast served all day, from french toast (they gave us a taste and it's incredible- I think it's coated in Panko breadcrumbs) to egg sandwiches to oatmeal.  Lunches with your burgers, sandwiches, salads.  Dinner, with your meats and your pastas.  
Let's start with the drinks: a bloody Maria with tequila instead of vodka (I'm a sucker for hot), a Bellini, a regular Bloody Mary, and a Bacon Bloody.  I loved my Maria.  You could taste the tequila in a good way, and it was spicy enough for even me.  Sweet Pea was so-so on his regular bloody although I tasted it and found it to be standard, but good standard.  K-dawg loved her Bellini which I tasted and found to be just eh, although pretty large.  And B$ liked his bacon bloody but found it to be too much bacon flavor for even him, and said he wouldn't be ordering it again.
Now, the food.  We started off with the pretzels and fondue (incredible- do order) and cheese with bread and jam, which was your standard cheese plate although the jam was fresh and delicious.  I got the egg sandwich with egg, cheese, and avocado sans the bacon on an onion bun, and regrettably, they brought it out the first time with bacon.  I chalk that up to pre-opening kinks.  K-dawg ordered the turkey reuben which I must say looked great and she absolutely raved over, with fries which I tasted and were fresh cut and tasty.  B$ had some sort of burrito which he deemed bland even after showering in tabasco.  Sweet Pea had the eggs and bacon, which he said was ""standard"".  Now, he later also had some sort of fruit and yogurt which he raved over.  
There were some additional kinks with the meal, from forgotten condiments, to forgotten side dishes, etc.  However, the manager came out and said she'd heard about the issues and gave us coupons for buy one, get one free brunch.  Which is pretty cool since it was all free.  You put up with some level of issue when you're getting a free meal, after all!  And let's get to that.  I said we didn't know what to expect.  Well, you know what?  After several alcoholic drinks and at least one bfast plus appetizers for each of us, the ENTIRE BILL WAS FREE.  $120 worth.  OK Butcher, you've got me.  I'm coming back.",2

《Chilled Mango Ice Cream $7.90》The foggy cool air in the store reminded me when i was a kid, my mom would buy us ice cream cake for special occasions. But before we dig into the cake, my brother and I would pick up some dry ice with a spoon and add water to it! It was so mesmerizing and as a child that was like the coolest 'experiment' you could do at home 

Ok back to my review on the ice cream! It was not the milky/creamy type of ice cream I usually eat, flavour was very distinct and I loved how refreshing the ice cream tasted!! It was topped with some grapefruit meat (wish there was more) and there was chunks of frozen mango inside :) The white liquid in the syringe was coconut milk which you could add into your ice cream before eating it. Fiancé said he was just going to try one bite of my ice cream but ended up eating half of it,  i think this is enough say on how delicious it was 

Ohh & Anyone wonder why they have a Tiger as their logo? It is based on the Chinese name 分子虎,  which directly translated to Molecular Tiger . I didn't know they have a Chinese name until I look at the receipt haha

As for the flavors we did try- I thought the salted caramel was better than a lot of others I have tried elsewhere and the blueberry swirl was also very good. I can imagine their chocolate (they were out) is probably pretty amazing.

It's more quality over quantity. Like everyone else said, they close early (2:30pm) and it's incredibly cheap (check groupon. I got 2 lunches for $15). They cater to Chinese tourists who come into town in large tour buses. You can tell that's where they really make their business from. The food was kept very clean and everything was warm. The Chinese food tastes authentic. Better than what you would find at Panda Express for sure. The star dishes for me was the curry, spicy string beans and the orange chicken (which is funny cause I don't really like orange chicken). They also had a salad bar with different Asian salads and a dessert area. When they seat you they'll take a drink order which is odd because they have an entire self serve beverage area with an assortment of sodas, coffee and tea.

I was not feeling the current juice flavours and ended up just getting a chocolate filled croissant. The staff was friendly enough and my only real complaint would be that the chocolate in the croissant seemed like the size of a hershey kiss if it was only in one corner of the croissant.

12514,3,1550793600000,"I'm not a fan of most sushi restaurants in Vegas. There are a couple expensive ones on the Strip that are great but pricey, and otherwise there are very few spots that I like in a more affordable price range.

Sakana, however, far exceeds my expectations. The chefs will talk with you, they're very friendly, and offer excellent recommendations. If you ask for whatever is good that day, you will get some great sushi, and it won't be the same every time either. I've already been here 3 times since I found out about it a month ago, and each time I've been served a different array of dishes, every single one of them outstanding.

But the most impressive thing about Sakana is that they actually cook great sushi rice. This is very rare for sushi restaurants in Vegas, and in my opinion makes a huge difference in the quality of the meal.

On top of the excellent food and chefs who I love, the prices are fantastic. At $22.95 for all-you-can-eat dinner as well as 2-for-1 beers during happy hour, the check will be about the same as any other all-you-can-eat sushi place in town, but the meal will be a hundred times better.

I urge you to sit at the sushi bar. The chefs are engaging and entertaining, but they will give you time to talk among yourselves when appropriate. And if you're adventurous (or already know how amazing it is), order quail egg, because it's one of the best things I've ever eaten anywhere.",3

I didn't even know that such an award existed until today!

This is another place that reminds me of Portland. It has a modern, yet hipster vibe as songs like ""Kids"" by MGMT and ""The Intro"" by The XX played in the background at 8 in the morning.

The Hawaiian breakfast was highly recommended by the waitress, seeing as how it also won 2nd place at a renowned breakfast competition in town. So of course, being somewhat reminiscent of an ""Islander"" myself, I figured I give it a try. After all, I'm quite the sucker for Kalua pork. It was really good. The slow cooked pork was tender and no pieces were over cooked or dried out in any way. I was very happy with this dish! My friend really enjoyed her Huevos Rancheros as well!

12568,3,1549238400000,"I only get one thing here.......The Nachos!  I don't desire to try anything else, and I doubt that anything else would taste as good!  These nachos are fucking perfect!  My buddy introduced me to Cafe Rio out in CA a few years back, and ever since then, I have been addicted to their pork nachos.  Haven't found any better, and I don't think I will!  

I saw that this Cafe Rio was opened within the last few months, and I decided to drive down here to check them out.  When a nacho craving hits, one must fulfill that craving...stat!  I signed up for their eclub/app and was given a $5.00 off coupon.  Score!  I pulled up to the place, parked, and walked in.  I ordered my nachos (they didn't sing the ""nacho, nacho, man"" song like at other Cafe Rios, but that was ok...always felt it was a bit corny anyways).  The guy I placed my order with was very friendly, as was the lady who made my nachos after they exited the conveyor belt.  I was wearing my St. Louis hat, and she asked if I had watched the All Star game etc.  Real personable and I am always happy when someone wants to talk sports.  I scanned my QR code on my phone, and my total came out to just under $5.00.  Score!   I took these bad boys out to my car and dug in.  Here is how they were.................

Pork Nachos-  First of all, I would like to give props to their ""to go"" packaging.  They use lids that are incredibly tall.  It provides maximum protection for your nachos, and keeps them looking beautiful.  A lot of places just slap a flat lid on your stuff, and when you open them up, you remove cheese and sour cream etc etc.  Not here....probably the best to go lids I have ever seen.  Good job, Cafe Rio!  Anyways...........back to the food!  The pork that they use is marinated in Dr. Pepper.  It provides a super sweet taste and a nice tender pork.  I have talked to folks that think it is ""too sweet"", but I think its perfect.  These nachos come loaded with pork, shredded cheese, choice of beans (I chose black), pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole.  Everything in these nachos works well with each other!  Plenty of meat, lots of cheese, a nice sized dollop of sour cream and guacamole, and a perfect amount of beans.  I am not the biggest bean fan, but Cafe Rios black beans are delicious! All of these things are piled onto some excellent chips!  That is one of the keys to a perfect nacho.  Can't have chips that get soggy and don't hold up to all these toppings.  Cafe Rios chips are perfect!  I mowed these things down while sitting in my car listening to some tunes.  I was sad when my tin was empty.  

Will I be back?  Yes indeed!  Service was friendly, prices are fair and the combo of flavors of those nachos are second to none!  Simply the best!  Wish they would build one of these in Surprise!",2

The only gripe I have, is that there were jalapeños in the cheese sauce over the baked potato and it didn't say that on the menu. It wasn't a deal breaker though.

12577,3,1550361600000,"The most stuffed I've ever been in my entire life hasn't been in any of the great food cities of the world. It's been at Devoured, two years in a row.

After a vivid recollection of last year: cringing from fullness while simultaneously forcing one of Green's roasted marshmallows down my throat, being unable to stop until I'd tasted every last dish, I thought I'd learned my lesson.

This year, I managed not to completely finish any of the dishes (aside from Lon's dark chocolate-dipped salted caramel pop... sweet baby Jesus) and planned to leave feeling uncomfortably full, at most. However, on my way out, I saw that they expanded this year's lineup, setting up a handful of restaurant booths and an entire strip of dessert places inside the cafe and Great Hall. Rat bastards. I literally haven't eaten for 27 hours and am still full.

My advice for next year: save anything that comes in a bag for later, and arrive STARVING. I cannot get enough of everything about Devoured. The food is stellar, the lines are non-existent (thanks to the flocks of people that essentially just go to drink and socialize), and the selection is immense enough to cause death by gluttony if you're the kind of person who has to taste everything. 

P.S .- I didn't even eat any meat and I pretty much rolled out of the festival.",2

The meat quality is really decent.

This place is not as good as GEN BBQ in ORange County, but for Vegas, I would say this is the best one.

added on Jan 25th 2014:
We have been back to this place a few times just because we love it. And last week, we took our friends here. We were so excited about the food. The food, again, was good. We have nothing to complain about it. However, since there were 6 of us, we ordered a lot. We didn't waste a single piece of food, it was just that we ate a lot. 

And thankfully one of my friends were Korean, so she understood the gestures from Korean. Apparently, the manager, or might be the owner, told the servers to cut down our meat during our last couple orders, and also she stopped the server from changing our grill, just so that we had to stop eating. My friend actually had to yell at her in Korean that the burnt smell really bad, then she replaced our grill.

I didn't like that at all. We understood that we ate a lot, but this is All You Can Eat. I would come back to this place again, but I will take off one star on their review, just because of the last visit.",2

They need to hire more people, or come up with a better system to streamline the process.  I work and the only time I can call the office is during my work hours.  It takes so long to get through, I have to clock out at work, go to the break room and sit on hold.  I don't always have time to do that.

So it's great that there's actually a pizza joint where I can get some crust with character - crust with taste.  And the fact that I can get a slightly healthier pizza for my daughter is a plus that is hard to pass up as she could live off of pizza if one could actually live off of eating only mushroom pizza.  How a five-year old ever convinced herself to like mushrooms I'll never know.  My wife loves the skinny pizza with pineapple, feta cheese, hold the mozzarella, jalapenos, and onions.

They upgraded their seats - they're super comfy, and plush and the arms can lift. The sound is loud - it's not the worst I have experienced - but sometimes you can hear the sound from the theatre beside. 

Staff are diligent - they follow rules, and aren't afraid to enforce the rules. They also hire extra security for big blockbuster opening weekends to handle potential crowds. 

The only other thing is the theatres on the lower level don't have washrooms very close by. You have to walk across the theatre to get to the main washrooms. This can take valuable minutes away from the movie if you need an emergency bathroom run during the film.

My boyfriend and I went here on our first night in Vegas to celebrate my birthday.  We arrived a tad early and after checking in with the friendly hostess, we sat at the bar and ordered two glasses of wine.  The bartender was very friendly and helped us with some recommendations.  After about five minutes, the hostess came over and showed us to our table.

The table was beautiful.  We were seated outside on their patio next to a tall fountain in between two Venetian hotel towers.  Gorgeous.  After another round of wine, we decided on their octopus special with heirloom tomatoes, a cheese plate (selected by our waiter), and the pan roasted trout with almonds in brown butter.  Our waiter seemed skeptical that it would be enough food for us, but I told him we were saving room for dessert.

The cheese plate was very yummy.  With the exception of one cheese, I was crazy about all of the selections.  The one cheese I was not a fan of was just too pungent for me, which is saying kind of a lot since I am a cheese maniac.  I will get to the octopus later, but the trout was amazingly buttery and delicious.  I was stuffed by the end of the meal so I did not get that much of the entree, but my boyfriend devored it and I loved the bites I wrestled away.

Going back to the special octopus: not good.  It was bascially glorified calamari with three little bites of tomatoes.  Very salty and disappointing.  And to think the waiter had raved about it.

Which brings me to the waiter.  Okay, when I go to a nice restaurant (especially a nice French restaurant), I want a waiter who is friendly, knowledgable, and professional.  Our waiter had the first two, but definitely not the last descriptor.  We didn't see him for the last two thirds of the meal, but heard him talking to the table behind us about getting into fist fights and brawl with guys in his neighborhood.  WTF???  It wasn't only the topic of conversation that was irksome, but the fact that he was bragging very loudly about and ignoring his other tables.

It kind of ruined the evening waiting for a dessert menu (which was never offered), waiting for the check (had to ask a busboy), and hearing some young punk talk about his psuedo-UFC activities.  I would just say that the experience was not consistent, really good in the beginning, but was down hill from there.",2

This time, I tried out one of their cocos- it's basically a hollowed-out coconut filled with tasty seafood and chilled broth. Alongside it was served the liquid from the coconut in a glass, and the meat scraped out from within. One coconut would have been enough to share between two people, and I have to say it was an amazing experience. 

The ostiones preparados were just perfect, as they were the first time I came here. Big, fat, meaty oysters covered in ceviche, avocado, onion, and a tiny bit of sauce. 

One of the people in our party ordered a tostada, and it looked really good too. Piled high with tasty seafood, with a nice crisp tortilla underneath... dammit... now I'm hungry again...

However, I believe that they normally schedule a separate stylist, colorist, assistant, etc.  My appointment was with Janine, who had her work cut out for her when I went in - my hair was about 8 inches longer than it needed to be and my roots had started taking over. I was a little nervous to have my long hair cut drastically short by someone I hadn't been to before, but she did a fantastic job, and did so with very little instruction/guidance. The color was perfect and I couldn't have asked for a better cut. I really enjoyed the salon. It is clean, edgy and appears to have all of the latest and greatest hair styling toys. The entire experience ran me $170, which is more than i typically pay, but I think it is a competitive price for the area. The salon is open late and on weekends, which is very convenient. I will definitely return. 
**I should also mention that another friend of mine, Fuzzy (called that because of his fuzzy hair), who has had his hair cut by the same barber since he was 6 years old, was recently given an extreme-hair-makeover by Ryan.  Ryan not only proved his genius status by seriously updating his look, but was very friendly along the way and patiently showed Fuzzy how to keep up his style after he left the salon. Great experiences all-around.",2

12799,2,1550620800000,"I was so disappointed tonight.  I have been going to Flancers with my family for so long, almost once a week.  I remember when my son was young and we would come in to see if he won the coloring contest, but tonight... well I don't think I will be back.  We got there about 5:30pm on a Friday night, and it was a little busier than normal.. I am guessing because the winter visitors are back.  We sat down right away at a table rather than a booth because all of the booths were full.  It took awhile for our waitress to come to the table and when she did.. she told us ""I had to go in the back to wash some appetizer dishes because we ran out"" ... no big deal, it happens.. and she came back to take our order.. but our table was right by the front door and more and more people came in, each one opening the door and it was drafty.. so I asked the hostess.. if there was anyway we could move to a booth since when one was available.. she first said.. ""which one?"" and I said.. well the first one.. she said, she already had people waiting.. sure I understand.. but we did get there, before those that were waiting and if they wanted a table, they could have ours... and we had not even ordered, we could have gotten up and left, but I thought she was going to do something about it.. or at least acknowledge my request and say no.. but instead.. I saw her talking to the waitress, who pointed over to us.. pointed at the booth and as she came by the table I said.. ""never mind, we don't want to cause a fuss""  And.. she said, rather rudely.. ""I don't know what you are talking about!.. what do you mean never mind?""  not friendly, not making any sense.. if she didn't know what was going on, why did she have that reaction, it felt like she got caught telling the hostess to forget about ... So.. others came and sat in the booths.. and we got our food.. but we didn't' see our server much after that.. I asked her to refill my son's lemonade.. she grabbed it and eventually brought it back.

Later, she seemed like nothing happened.. back to the faux friendliness.. which now made me feel worse.. I started to realize that after all these times that we had visited this place.. almost a little family tradition.. I did not want to come back.  It took forever for our ice tea to ever get refilled.. the manager came by and cleared the plates and didn't ask.. ""how was everything.?""  because I am sure he knew by then that we were upset.. but that it didn't really matter to him.. hey, they were busy.  

I am sure that they will remain busy... the winter visitors will keep them busy for now.. but this customer that used to come every week with his family won't be back.  The food is ok.. but it's not the only place around.

I realized tonight that the people there, are different, or should I say indifferent to how the customer feels.. that isn't the same manager that used to be here and truly seemed to care how we enjoyed our meal.. these are not the same servers that had been there in the past that had a smile on their face when they greeted you.  This has become your average cafe.. and if you are a frequent visitor like we were.. I challenge you to look around.. are you going here because you always have?  isn't it different now?

To be honest it's a little sad.. this used to be a little family tradition.. when we didn't know what we wanted for dinner.. we would always say.. well let's just go to Flancers,but that's done.

Goodbye Flancers",2

They were soft and perfectly fried. We followed up with the chop salad that my husband and I shared. I loved the salad and my husband, who normally doesn't eat salad, ate the majority of it.

Learning to navigate the Segways along the desert trails was an awesome experience. After an introduction to the proper handling of the Segways and a few trial runs in the parking lot, we were led into the desert for a tour among the cacti. 
A few spills but after an hour and a half in the spectacular desert, we concluded our adventure back at the parking lot. 
The Segways were easy to handle as long as you pay attention to the road
 ( potholes, roots,rocks, twigs) and not panic if you inadvertently run over something. 
This is a fun experience and the desert is a great place to ride.
A highly recommended activity.",3
12833,2,1549497600000,"We never come to Las Vegas without stopping here.  If a restaurant can be a vacation unto itself, this is the place. 
MAIN COURSES These are huge and delicious (notably the fish tacos, crispy fish sandwich and macadamia nut crusted salmon to name the ones I've tried.)
APPETIZERS Instead of the large entrees, I prefer to order an appetizer (such as the Ahi tuna tacos or Ahi poki Napoleon) and salad (the bungalow salad sounds simple, but it's SO delicious!) so I have more room for the so amazing cocktails and dessert--more on those later.  My husband adores the chicken tortilla soup and the seared scallop sliders.  And we always order the macadamia crusted goat cheese, even though we have the cookbook and make it at home from time to time. 
I should mention that I'm allergic to shellfish, so I can't eat shrimp, scallops, crab, lobster, etc., but I never feel deprived here, even though TB Café places a strong emphasis on seafood in general.  THANK YOU!
COCKTAILS  These are heaven.  Like vacation in a glass.  Best pina colada anywhere.  Yummy mojitos.  A key lime martini to die for.  Blood orange margarita--yes, please.  My husband ordered none of these, but was very happy with his order.  (Hmm, memory of beverages consumed is a little foggy, wonder why?)
DESSERT:  I keep trying to resist the key lime pie to try something different, but I can't do it.  My husband has ordered the pina colada cake and loved it, but his current favorite is the pineapple creme brulee served in a thick slice of carmelized pineapple.  I would love to try the malted chocolate pie or the peanut butter pie, but the key lime pie has a hold on me...
SERVICE:  So warm, welcoming & attentive without being overly familiar.  They're happy to carry on a conversation about food if you engage them, or they'll drop off your cocktail & appetizer and just keep an eye out for when your head pops up or your drink gets low.  My understanding is that a lot of the staff has been here since they opened (close to 10 years ago) and that tells me they treat their staff well, and their staff is loyal to them.  With plenty of other restaurants & bars in the LV area, that's saying something impressive.  I believe our server's name was Matt, and he was perfect.
DECOR:  I'm not exaggerating when I say we have seriously investigated decorating our home in a similar style.  Love the tropical wallpaper, the combination of dark and painted-white woods, the floral pillows in the wooden booths, etc.  It's a relaxing color palette with colors of sand, golden pineapple, and shades of green, much like resorts we've visited in Hawaii and Florida.
MANAGEMENT:  We met the sales manager Kaaren Kragerud for the first time during this last visit, and she's the real deal.  She spent quite a bit of time chatting with us about the offerings at the restaurant and at the store, and overall put a friendly human touch on an already great experience.  She's amazing, and we'll ask if she's in when we visit from now on.  
SUMMARY:  Just go.",2

I've been in store twice and have called a few times. The same girl --totally can never think of her name but it starts with a B, she's always really nice and wants to get us the best deal on what we're looking for. They pretty much have 99% of things in stock that we need and she even made sure we were able to pick up an item they did not have at a Best Buy store soon after, she made the order and everything and made sure we got the same prices and deals we were offered.

It was over crowded Tyron St in downtown Charlotte is way to narrow to have this event. There were more people selling goods and services than food by two to one. The stupid little tokens you have to buy are to expensive and you get very little for them. Charlotte has a little used park in downtown called Marshall park why can't they have this event there instead of blocking off streets and disrupting traffic for four days every year. Next year I suggest that they get more food vendors and fewer people selling their good and services. Bring in the local food trucks and have it in Marshall park.,2

The miso soup has also become very salty. I felt like it wasn't worth it to pay $20 to go eat there since barely any food came until the very end. Even desserts took a long time to come.

The bar seemed fun, although we were here during lunch and on a Sunday so it was pretty quiet. However, because the game was going on the service was TERRIBLE. Our waitress barely stopped to check in on us and took over 20 minutes to return our check after we asked for it.

We're super stoked to have a great pizza joint in our neighborhood.

Unrelated but I'm not sure why two reviews were necessary for the 'metal mishap?' All new businesses make mistakes/learn along the way and I'm sure this was a one off miss.

I started with the stuffed jalapeno appetizer, which was just, well, kind of boring. Ground seasoned chicken on top of a cut-in-half grilled jalapeno with marinara sauce on top, super basic ya'll.

Next I had the oxtail fried rice and omg that stuff needs to come with a warning label, ox tail tastes like dirt. It's gamey AF and I like gamey, I'm down for lamb any of the week and I order birria tacos now and again, but ox tail is another level. It's also got that sinewy fat situation going on that just makes me gag. I know some folks love it, those who order the tendon at pho places for example, would love ox tail, but not I. 

The shining star of the meal was the garlic noodles, they were perfect, dry and packed with flavor! I could eat 10 plates of it. I also really enjoyed my creamy green tea, so there were some hits amongst the misses and for that we go 3 stars.",2
13012,3,1549065600000,"We live just behind this restaurant and we knew eventually we will give this bistro a shot. So on a warm Friday evening when everywhere else on the 17 ave was full of people we decided to try this new restaurant. 

There were a lot of empty tables on the sunny patio which was a big surprise for me. We decided to order beer and some snacks to start and if it goes well we will move on to more food. 

The draft list was good but nothing special, but the prices were a little bit steep (9$ for a pint). We also ordered the charcuterie board. The drinks arrived fast but it took them at least half an hour to bring the charcuterie board !!!!!!!. Keep in mind everything on the board is already prepared. Anyway, putting aside the time, the dish itself was the most greedy and underwhelming charcuterie board ever.  For 18$ I was expecting a generous portion of cold cuts. However it was exactly the opposite, only three kind of cold cuts and three very small slices each (Total 9 small paper thin slice of cold cuts  !!!!) Also the cold cuts itself were nothing special, I had much much better cuts in the city.  I think they should do some research about the meaning of a Bistro. A bistro is supposed to be a relaxed, affordable and cozy restaurant which was not the case here at all. 

After that experience, we decided to skip the food and move to another restaurant. I realized why everywhere else the patio was filled with customers and their patio was half empty. I think they were just serving the overflow from the pubs in front of them. I literally saw a group leaving their patio because their table on the other side of street was ready. 

We gave our feedback to the server so hopefully they will fix the flaws. I myself probably will not go back there.",2

Donte, our server, was attentive and made a mean mojito- which was perfect for a sunny day. 

I had the steak with fries. Cooked perfectly and filled me up. My friend had salmon and cried with how perfectly it was cooked. She's an emotional lady but tears don't lie!

13036,1,1551225600000,"My fiance and I stayed at the resort for a week during Valentine's Day, and overall, it was a good experience.  However, this review is about my INCREDIBLE experience at the spa!  I had Art for my massage, and my fiance had Michelle for his (and thought she was great.)  He rarely feels truly relaxed during a message, and he came out completely zen-ed out.  Loved seeing him so chill.

My RIDICULOUSLY amazeballs massage was with Art.  Can we start with shallow things?  Firstly, he is, hands down, one of the coolest looking people you've ever seen.  I know that sounds strange, but seriously: you've never seen a person with more beautiful hair -- I don't even want to tell you about it...I just want to let you experience the coolness for yourself as I did.  :)  On to the important stuff.  My back muscles are inhabited by Satan.  I have been to 30+ massage therapists and only one (before I met Art) had been able to break through my lower lumbar muscles.  BUT, no one had ever been able to defeat my shoulder muscles...UNTIL ART!  When I say deep tissue...I don't mean ""a lot of pressure""...I mean ""Please Atomic Elbow my back throughout the entire massage, sir.""  Well, I don't know what type of magic is in Art's fingers and hands...but he manipulated my muscles in a way where he was clearly using a lot of pressure, but it felt gentle somehow at the same time?  I wish I could explain this fabulous experience better but the words escape me.  All I'm saying is the man can do anything: gentle or destroy demonic back muscles with you barely noticing it's happening.  My back and shoulders felt like jelly for over a week after my massage with him. Some people are massage therapists, and I can't for the life of me understand why, because it clearly isn't their calling.  BUT: Art, on the other hand, should never be anything else.  That man is a back healer, so relaxing, and truly gifted.  Thank you so much, Art!  

I cannot wait to come back to Scottsdale just to go to massage heaven again.  :) You're the best!!

Also, side note: Penny (I believe that was her name) the receptionist was super friendly, helpful, and very fun!  They have a great staff there.  Whoever did their hiring knows their stuff.  Because of them all, I had a perfect experience for my Valentine's Day massage...",2

The company's organization seems pretty poor. The reason I'm leaving behind a 5 star review is that after multiple phone calls (yea it's sad that the responsibility on following up seems to lie on the customer) I was able to meet a nice lady named Desiree who was able to promptly take special care and jump over some hoops to make sure that I got the hospital bed not the next day, but within half an hour of calling her.

Knowing the weekend held a major event I reserved a queen non-smoking, and paid a night in advance. My boyfriend, and I arrived after a long 5 hour drive to the news that our requested 2 double bed non-smoking was no longer available. I quickly corrected the staff member who then informed me that there was no non-smoking rooms, because the hotel had over booked. She offered me an ""upgraded"" smoking room. I asked if this was complimentary, and she said no. The hotel works on a first come first serve policy (Then why make a reservation??) Reluctantly we agreed, and they charged my boyfriend the 2nd night. She vaguely informed him that the charges would be held due to the weekend. We arrived in our new room that smelled like an ash tray, and had two small double beds. My boyfriend is 6'6 a double doesn't cut it. We called the front desk who quickly found us a queen smoking room. It smelled awful, but we wanted to get the weekend started. My boyfriend checked his bank account, and was surprised to find the hotel charged him double the amount of the room. When we inquired about the charges the front staff explained that a debit/credit card is subjected to a $50.00 a night hold for any misc. charges made to the room.The charges are reversed only after you check out, and have made no charges to your room. The staff members explanation ""Yeah it's stupid, but the hotel doesn't want to get ripped off"" WTH?? These extra charges caused us a lot of stress as we were traveling on a moderate budget. Housekeeping NEVER cleaned our room the whole weekend. On check out they informed us we had a balance for the night. I was confused as my boyfriends account had already been charged. I was met with a very rude, and snippy response by the front desk staff. At that point I was just done. I left feeling stressed out, uncomfortable, and smelling like an ashtray. I have written a letter of complaint to the hotel with no response. To add insult to injury the hotel never reversed the room charges even though we never charged anything to the room.

The service was ridiculously slow and my pregnant friend had originally wanted dinner at 7, so we were already starting off late. Garlic naan took 20 mins to come out, dinner took just over an hour, and then, we couldn't find anyone to get the check from. When they finally brought the checks, they double charged us for a side order of naan and an appetizer of naan, saying we were a large party. Um, what? Only one person ordered naan, the table didn't. We shouldn't have been charged for something we didn't order and that took like 5 mins to clarify. I also didn't like that gratuity was included for 5 or more, as the service was awful.

Food was fine, good vegetarian options at least. Flavor was good with the cauliflower but as other reviews have said, they were soggy. The samosas were also good, but expensive if you only get two. And the paneer tikka masala was also a small portion for such a high price tag (almost $20). 

It's decent Indian food but for poor service, expensive prices, and small portions, I can take my business elsewhere.",3

This establishment makes a complete mockery of the dishes they are trying to present. I pass by this place every time I go for work, and I decided to stop by to check things out (I hadn't checked the reviews prior to going). Food uses the lowest grade cuts (literally scraps). There is no attention or continuity between the owners and workers. Overall, this restaurant is sloppy.

We arrived at about 10am on Saturday and were seated right away. Being a newb to the joint, it was a little bit confusing of what to do once you enter but figured out we needed to make our way to the cash register for the hostess to seat us. Ordered ice coffees which were fitting with the hot weather we have been having along with the smoked salmon omelette and focaccia bread and my boyfriend had the challah french toast. My boyfriend loved his french toast, which I had a bite of. It was deliciously sweet with a little bit of crunch and it was surprising with the brie. My smoked salmon omelette did not have any cheese as I did not opt for the goat cheese. Looking back I think it would have been wise if I had - the omelette was good with the dill and the herbs and tomato but an omelette needs some cheese! The focaccia bread was okay though there wasn't much flavor so I'm thinking I'll try the pumpernickel next time. The hostess and waitress were both nice and provided great service which is always a plus.

I have never met more of an understanding and honest man as Ron. I am from Los Angeles and had a gas leak in my car, being a tourist with funds in my wallet running short, Ron was reassuring and understood my situation. Any other mechanic or technician of any kind would have taken advantage of us. 

Ron was extremely professional, he ordered a rare fuel pump for our car (due to a dangerous leak) and gave us a rental car to further enjoy or last day in Vegas. By the time we new it, he called us within 2-3 hours with our car ready for pickup. 

My experience has been so delightful with Ron that in the tragic case of a mechanical issue, I will come to Vegas again to have it repaired for the reason that an honest and trustworthy mechanic is hard and almost impossible to come by from my past experiences.

He's very lucky I wasn't there, or he would have got his ass whooped!!! Needless to say I took the high road and called the manager. She was supposed to give my girl her next wash for free.

We walked in and the place reeked of pineapples, more than likely to set that tropical mood.  FYI: islands don't smell like pineapples, but whatever.

We were seated in a booth, which was nice, and our server took our drink orders right away.  We threw in some appetizers and 10 minutes went by before they come out luke warm.  The plantain chips, which I expected to be fresh from the fryer, were ice cold.  Oh well.

The food itself took 20 minutes to come out, which is way too long, even with refills of the bread basket.  By the time the food came out, I was full, but I tried it anyway.  The cuban is good, not great, and the other items my friends' bought: pork sandwich and jerk chicken were disgusting.  I don't eat things that look as if someone chewed it up and spat it out.  Presentation wasn't there, but it's not a 5 star restaurant.  All I ask for is good food, and the stuff they use in their sandwiches for the pork's bbq sauce and the jerk seasoning was too sweet and tasted very commercial.  Not for me, or them.

Overall, nice place to spend 12-15 bucks on a sandwich, but not worth the price tag.  I'll never eat here again, no matter how decent the appetizers were.",2

Kaya's happy hour specials included half off most drinks. I got the caipirinha and grapefruit basil margarita and my husband got a frozen mango mojito and Kayapolitan. Wasn't a fan of the Kayapolitan, mainly because it tasted like juice. But our other drinks were delicious and strong (get Joe to make your drinks!). After two I was recommending the grapefruit margarita to everyone sitting around me, haha. 

We also munched on the Yucatan hot bean dip which had some good kick to it. Unfortunately, I don't think their food is part of the happy hour, so you're looking at around $10 bucks for an appetizer. But when all was said and done, our bill came to $35 and we got 5 drinks and the bean dip (with a double portion of chips), so I'd call that a deal!

  When I called my order was taken quickly and they happily accepted my request to substitute the 2 steamed white rice orders that came with entrees with an order of egg fried rice. I split things with Japanese and Chinese items for variety1.  Spiny tuna roll was very good with a nice presentation...there is nothing worse than seeing a sloppy put together roll.  The crunchy roll had some good flavor and texture.  The tuna sashimi was a very generous portion to the point that I decided to cut each slice in half because they were so big.
  I stopped by to pick things up 30 minutes later and was promptly greeted by a woman upon walking in the door.  I'm pretty sure she stands by the window when she sees headlights and is waiting for you to walk in the front door.  The bartender had my order ready and even hooked me up with some extra hot mustard and duck sauce upon request.  After getting home I realized that they had already given me more than enough originally, but the extra was a nice touch.  No scowls upon hearing me as for more, but instead a smile and ""no problem"".
  After getting home and unpacking things I was a little confused...the food was all there but there was a bonus item.  Tortillas.  WTF?  Conversation going on in my head:

""Are these tortillas?""
-yes
""I didn't realize tortillas were a Chinese food""
-they aren't you dumb ass

Went here during a business trip. $5 happy hour margaritas weren't bad. Coworker had the cascabel ribeye and I had the Camaraones Esconidos (shrimp stuffed chicken breast w/ chipotle wine sauce). I thought my meal was pretty good...loved the sauce but very disappointed there were only two shrimp for the ""stuffed"" portion.  My coworker said his ribeye was far from his expectations.

The appetizer steak nachos we got were huge in size, but we paid extra to get steak on them and they were VERY skimpy with the steak. Also, the nachos were dry. They could have used a sour cream or queso or other wet component. The tacos I got were tasty, but small for the price. Overall, it's a little pricey but good food.",2

The food is mediocre at best. Wings are 3"" of breading around 1 millimeter of meat. Hamburgers were all greasy and lopsided on the bun and gave us terrible upset stomachs.

As for service...sure it's nice to look at 21 year old waitresses in skimpy clothing. BUT... the waitress decided to take our order and not write anything down just did it by memory. So of course when our order came it was completely wrong. Then she gave us an attitude problem. After food was delivered she disappeared until we were ready to leave.

Sorry, I won't eat here again. We spent over $100 for food that was no better than what you would get off the McDs dollar menu.",2

13271,2,1550188800000,"First time to check this place out. It is billed as a sandwich shop, although it's not what I expected. I expected a big sandwich board and walk up order situation.  And many people came in and out and ordered take-out. However, we came to eat in. And the restaurant had tables where we sat and were waited on. Not normal for a sandwich shop. But it was great.

I tried the ""fry plate"", which was a plate of French fries covered with your choice of toppings. I had steak, onions and mushrooms. It was excellent.

A friend tried the tri-tip fry plate and he claimed it was also excellent.

The prices were reasonable and the staff was kind. Food took a little longer than other sandwich shops but it was fresh , hot and crispy (I was delighted to have hot crispy fries, rather than old soggy ones)!

I will go back and try the sandwiches another time to see if the place lives up to that part of its namesake.

UPDATE: I did return and had a sandwich- the Cuban. I loved it. I've had Cuban sandwiches before. This was perfect. As was the side (cheesy fries). This will be a main stay for me. Lots to try here.",2

the menu was some what overwhelming in size and volume! we got a dozen oysters - they were AMAZING! the best oysters i've had, ever.. the crispy rice - i thought it was going to be like a bowl of rice but it was surprisingly filling and delicious! similar to a sushi roll but instead a small rice patty served with tuna and some spice on top!

And given, it has only been a couple of days since opening. Parts of my rice was crunchy and cold, some of it was warm. How can you open an Asian restaurant and not even get the rice right? 
Secondly, portion is way smaller than other places like Jaburrito and Soho Burrito for the same price. 
The ordering window is either too tall or too thick- I'm screaming across my order to the poor girl who can hardly hear me. I like the menu, it features tofu as a base. I also like the Coca Cola refrigerator that features more drink options like RAMUNE, Vita Coco, Oolong Tea and Japanese Coffee in a can. Very clean and spacious dining space.

However, given the price ($17 per person, and that includes your non-alcoholic drinks and dessert), I think it is very reasonable. Staff are attentive and courteous. There is also a section of food for those not liking Asian food - fried chicken, pizza, etc, a hibachi type area where you choose your meats and veggies to be stir fried, and sushi. The sushi/sashimi is decent - and some I can tell were frozen, but still good. Hey, it is a buffet after all, and it will be tons cheaper if you fill up on sushi here. There are also typical chinese dishes like lo mein and such, and a few more exotic things like kim-chi and chicken feet. Overall, a fun and clean buffet, in a very nice atmosphere.",2

- The convenience store is clean and carries good products.
- They have full service attendants to gas up your car at no additional cost....only tips if you choose.
- Their oil change/smog check garage is quick and does a good job.

Now the reasons why I'm rating this place so low. #1 we were the only table in the restaurant besides 2 take outs yesterday night. Our food took almost 30 min to get to the table. #2 even though the Marsala tasted pretty good, the portion was so small & there was literally 8 chopped up pieces of chicken in the 16 oz bowl which we paid 16 bucks for. #3 we ordered the paradise special platter that had 5 little ass pieces of different types of chicken, a little piece of fish , 2 quarter sized pieces of lamb, & 2 nickel sized shrimps, which we paid 25 bucks for. None of which had any flavor but we managed to eat it because we dipped everything in the Marsala sauce while we forced ourselves to eat. #4 we ordered saffron rice which is suppose to be more flavorful but it literally tasted like salty rice. 6 bucks for that. So portions were definitely not worth the price. Especially when the food wasn't very tasty. Chicken tikki Marsala would have been worth it if we had more then 8 little cubes of meat.",2

The owners of Postino just can't go wrong I'm convinced. I'm a long time fan of both locations and was super excited when they opened up Windsor as they have a full bar and different, numerous options for food. 

Let's start with the interior, love it. Modern with some natural elements; very laid back with an awesome patio that I've actually yet to sit on as I'm usually at the bar or one of the comfy booths as soon as you walk in.

The staff is always on point and friendly without being too in your face which I really love being that I am a server and I don't really need the follow up every 4 minutes. I most recently sat at the bar solo on Wednesday or Thursday and I didn't get the bartender's name but he was really nice without being overbearing. 

Food wise? Omnomnom is all I have to say. No, the Backyard burger is awesome. I've only gotten it Classic style but it's delicious! The meat is flavorful and the portion is generous to say the least. I'm also a big fan of their fondue and the Brown Bag (??) Chicken sandwich. Everything tastes fresh and you can't go wrong with Churn next door for the dessert...best Butter Pecan I've ever had.

This area has some solid restaurants and Windsor is no different. Definitely a great spot for lunch during the day or a date at night. Check it out!",2

After another 20 mins passed and after seeing other vehicles that were behind me in line where being worked on, I decided to talk to the service tech again, this time he suggested to make another appointment for a later time.

The salad was her lunch so she was going to be done well before my food ever showed up. Finally saw the server again and asked about the tacos. ""They are coming right up!""

Wife is picking at her salad trying to wait for my food to come out. Finally, the tacos have arrived. It's now 12:30 and I'm starving and pissed off.

13440,2,1550448000000,"This review is for the breakfast menu.

The bakery items, including the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies, deserve 4 stars.  They were simply fantastic.  However, I would assign 2 stars for other menu items such as eggs, breakfast buritto, bagels  and coffee/tea.

The chocolate chip cookies were irresistibly chewy and chock-full of gooey chocolate.  The chocolate croissant were flaky with a generous sprinkling of chocolate.  These were great accompaniments with coffee (average) and tea (tea bag !). 

We ordered the mushroom and cheese omlette which was fluffy, but the mushroom and cheese seemed to be thrown in as an afterthought instead of being cooked along with the omlette.  The smoked salmon and cream cheese bagel was 'over grilled' and thought it was overpriced at $7.

Ambiance was nice but did not find staff particularly friendly nor rude.

I was slightly concerned about the cleanliness of the establishment - things were being hand-washed at a sink in the back, and the pumice stones and files were not the disposable kind. And there were nail clippings on the arm rest where I went to place my purse.

Service was friendly, and my toes looked nice when finished, but nowhere near the best pedicure I've had. Probably not even the top 10. 

For $25, you get what you pay for. You're not rushed, but you're not going to be in love with your feet when you're finished. 

My recommendation: if you can, splurge and go to Fortelli across the street. It's $47, but the atmosphere and service are miles better, and your feet will look and feel absolutely spectacular when you leave.

I live in the Far East part of the valley and called Peoria Ford this morning to confirm they still had the used vehicle I was eager to drive out and look at and most likely purchase.

An hour later I called back and explained that a salesman was supposed to be checking on the status of a used vehicle. The new salesman said he would check to make sure the vehicle was available. He confirmed that the vehicle was on the lot and asked if we would like to come take a look at it. I explained to him that I live about an hour away so I would leave my house now and be there in an hour to look at the vehicle. In the hour it took me to get to Peoria Ford I received another 5 phone calls from the salesman and his manager making sure I was coming to the dealership.

After waiting 20 minutes another salesman walked out (the one who I first called and he never called me back) I told him I just wanted to see the vehicle and he responded with ""oh we don't have that vehicle here anymore"" as anyone would be I got pretty upset. I said I had called to verify and then received numerous phone calls from salesman confirming before my arrival and none told me that the vehicle was not there. This place is a TOTAL SCAM!!!! Nobody even apologized for the mishap, just asked me to leave...terrible customer service! I will be sure to deter any family/friends/coworkers from ever getting a car from this dealership!",2

13495,3,1549065600000,"Comfort food and I'm not even Latin. There's nothing that hits the spot quite like their pressed Cubano, the sharpness of the mustard and tangy, crunchy pickle really shine through the creamy cheese and tasty pork. It all comes together on a crispy, buttery bun. There's not a lot to say - you just gotta get one. 
If you're a sandwich person you can't sleep on the pork belly medianoche. The bun is pillowy-soft, but the sweet glazed pork belly has a crispy crust, but a rich fatty satisfaction that is unmistakable. This all dressed with a spicy, creamy, sweet slaw and is a scientifically proven hangover remedy. 
If you're looking for a more serious commitment, opt for one of the plated options. The roasted pork shoulder falls apart with a fork and has the perfect balance of tender meat and satisfying fat to mix into those tasty rice and beans.",1
13496,2,1550188800000,"I often decide to try a place based on 4-5 stars and then I read the negative reviews before going to see if they fixed their issues.. Our personal experience for a party of 6 at 5pm on a weekday was excellent. The service was well paced, the food quality was excellent, the side dishes were always filled, the water was refilled promptly, and the pitchers of beer were nice and cold. I thought for sure there would not be enough food especially since they recommended we only order 2 of the 2 person combos even though we were are party of 6. I was fully prepared to add more food. We were pleasantly surprised that there was the perfect amount of food especially with the extras that came with each combo. The steamed egg and tofu soup that came with the combo were yummy. I've had better kimchi pancakes, but it was still a nice extra. The person cooking the meats for us was very attentive and cooked everything nicely. As she cooked, she kept an eye out for getting our side dishes refilled. She told us which meat she was cooking each time.  The variety of side dishes were great. The seasonings on the beef and pork were not overwhelming since there was no need to hide poor quality meat like some places. I didn't have to drink a ton of water like the cheap places that season heavily. The presentation of the single person dessert (kind of a snow ice) in a martini glass was cute but $7.50 is a little steep.  It tasted pretty good though..
We made reservations and it was great to walk in with the table set up with all the sides already on the table. The range hoods were not super loud and worked as best as any of the bbq places can. Yes it's a little pricey but we felt it was worth it. Maybe because it was not busy or maybe we lucked out with our server, but we had great service. A lot of people like Hobak, but we had terrible service there and we didn't like the sides at Hobak. The quality of the meat is the same.",2

I love the Shrimp ""Ooo La La!!!"" which is flash fried & tossed in a sweet & sour Papaya vinaigrette. And, we also love the Diver Scallops as well as the Sea Bass. Since we both love Crème Brulee, we usually go for the Trio of Crème Brulee  - delish!! 

The restaurant is a little pricey but worth the splurge. Also, we have been when they have participated in Restaurant Week -- or  when they have offered fixed price specials.

The Pork belly ramen noodle soup is a spectacular taste of heaven I cannot express how much I loved this ramen, the broth wasn't too salty and let the other ingredients of the soup speak for itself. The real star of the ramen was of course the pork belly, which the deep fry but the pork was still tender and super flavorful. The pork bun was also very good, the bun was very fluffy and the sauce the pork came with was the right amount of Asian Hoisin. The staff were amazing as they made sure that your eating experience was the upmost best. Nick was especially very nice and welcomed us and made sure the food was perfect.

 I have now eaten at Los Taquitos 3 times! First time I tried Carne Asada tacos and Carnitas tacos, both were really good! The Carnitas tacos were moist and flavorful! WOW! We also had a quesadilla, and it was creamy buttery deliciousness. Have had both items a second time and I am still SOLD! Oh and their Salsa's are really good, too!

 I also tried their Pozole, which was a good size portion and very flavorful, a little too salty for my tastes, but I would order it again for my Pozole fix! 

If you are looking for a new taco shop...maybe you should find a different one because this one is mine now and I don't want to share! Just Kidding! 

Oh and here's an important tip if you like Mexican food...Don't order Tamales at restaurants or taco shops, if you have had a real tamale made at home. They are always too dry and disappointing! And I don't think you can judge a TACO SHOP by an enchilada/tamale...try a taco or burrito...I truly believe that not everything at one restaurant can be great! In my opinion!",2

I like Thai food...more specifically, I like spicy, well made, flavorful Thai food!

That's what you get at Touch of Thai...currently holding the title of ""Best Thai Food within Walking Distance of my Home"":)

This is a lovely little spot, a little bit off the beaten path...and by ""beaten path"" I mean that it is about a block off Scottsdale Rd. and parked between a defunct gym and an ""Asian Massage"" joint, in between a bunch of offices.

It's across the corner from ""Giligin's (every now and then you can hear gales of laughter from across the street as somebody ""tosses a midget"" or something:)

The restaurant itself is lovely, with a little courtyard between its two dining areas (kind of an unusual layout), and nice open feel, a pretty little bar area...oh yeah, and the food is terrific!

A very nice Thai couple own and operate this place, and the food reflects the love and attention to detail that they put into their restaurant...the young lady that owns the place is also (apparently) the main cook and the other night when The Beautiful Carin and I had dinner, she was very concerned about over spicing the Garlic beef, and came out to see if I was going to be OK, with it (she even offered to remake the dish if I had a problem with it...but I didn't...for whatever reason, I seem to be able to metabolize capsaicin like it's candy:)

Other people try to hang with me on the hot stuff and say things ""oh my god...I think I just ate the sun"" and ""it tastes like burning"" while I ask for ""more chili oil or sriracha, please"":)

Carin doesn't like the heat so much so we had our Pad Thai (I know, seems kind of boring, but they make the dish so darn well at TOT) at medium spice and our veggie curry at low heat, all tasty and delightful!

Speaking of curries, if you are a curry fan, you could worse than to stop by TOT...they have a couple of menu pages seemingly devoted to a wide variety of yellow, red, green, blue, orange, and other rainbow colored curries (I might be exaggerating about some of the colors, but I've had some of the red and yellow curry dishes and they are as good as any I've found around here:)

They even have a whole rack of these curry dishes on their lunch special menu ($8.95 for a giant plate of lunchtime Thai:)

The next time you're in Old Town, bored by the Modern Steaks and Olive and Ivy's, get off the beaten path and give TOT a spin...they are nice people, good cooks, they seem to find both flavor and heat back in the kitchen...and if you are in the mood, you can stroll down the block after dinner or lunch and get an ""Asian Massage"" to ""settle your stomach"" :-)",2
13556,1,1549152000000,"Known as ""The Onion"" by regulars, this is an awesome dive bar with some of the best burgers in the valley.  I used to live near it - and went FAR too often.  My friend told me he went there the other day - can you say Jealousy?   

The bar rocks.  The service is out of this freaking world.  Go there 3 times in a month and they'll most likely remember what you ordered.  Alcoholic drinks are served stiff, and sodas are served LARGE so the designated driver doesn't have to keep asking for a refill.  (I hate that!)  

Menu is limited - as bar food should be - but everything here is awesome.  There is no ""kitchen"" in the back - you can watch everything they are doing right to the side of the bar.  Where did those french fries come from?  Oh yea, they put a potato on that metal device, pulled a handle and presto - fry shapes.  As for the tomato and lettuce?  It's in a Tupperware container in the fridge.  Other than that it's burgers, chicken, fries and onion rings.  Even if there is just one person behind the bar, they will come out to see what they can get ya - drinks or otherwise.  And they'll bring it to your table.  

Sure, there are big screen tv's, pool tables and a pretty decent juke box for a spot like this.  But the real attraction is watching the regulars come and go while you enjoy your awesome burger goodness.",2

If you have never been you must get the Pineapple Propeller to start with.  Not too sweet, just right and oh so refreshing!  You can't go wrong with any of their cocktails.  They all have the perfect balance and makes you want more.  The fried chicken skins are amazing, especially with the house hot sauce.  The hush puppies are quite good, and the bone marrow is fabulous!  On a recent trip we ordered the Tennessee Hot and Umbrian fried chicken and liked it but didn't love it.  While the flavor was great, there was too much breading and not enough chicken.  On another occasion we had the pig cheek pot pie and the beef brassato.  Stunning dishes, so much flavor and rather filling.  I'll keep coming as long as the drinks keep flowing and there is more meat on my fried chicken.",2

But at some time in the last 2 years, Kohinoor eliminated any other meat, other than chicken, even at their dinner buffet.  No lamb, goat or beef, just chicken.  Buffet does not include drink.  Kohinoor's Indian beer for $10 for 22 oz costs $2 more than India oven $8 for same bottle.   Now (Aug 2017) their  Groupon is asking you to pay more than you used to pay, for less discount.   So now you only get about 33% discount, pay $16 for $24 value for two, when before you got 50%, but the requirement to buy one food item has always been the same.  Also, the lady answering the Kohinoor phone, can be very rude, sometimes.

Now I go to India Oven because for the same price for dinner $11.95, IO has both goat AND lamb dishes, as well as chicken, in their dinner buffet.  AND India Oven has free chai and mango lassi which can cost $2.50 - $4 for one glass at other Indian restaurants.  The goat at India Oven is soooooo good!

We were then seated at a table in the very back directly across from the bathrooms...appetizing!  In all fairness she asked if that was ok but we were hungry and had our infant with us so we said ok- the point here is that there shouldn't be a table there to begin with! 

Took 10 min to get greeted and 20 min for our food.  Although busy, the allure of a diner is the quick service and cheap prices- which were NOT cheap!  It was nearly $9 for an omelet with any cheese and 2 choices of veggies or meat.  Each additional option was 50 cents.  If you wanted a western it was nearly $10! I think this is a lot compare to other diners like Toms in dormont.  

After waiting for what felt like forever, the food was really good.  The turkey sausage was really salty though and they only gave a tiny cup of syrup for the pancake, which was luke warm.

It seems the service is different each time we come. Sometimes they give free bread with sauce, which is a lovely starter while we wait for yummy pizza. We usually come at night and they are always attentive and never get our order wrong. 

Today our lunch lacked in service. Our waitress never came around to the table, she never brought us bread. We literally watched this woman bring bread to every table around us, but skip us, it was so weird. A nice man who is usually there finally brought us some after he noticed the woman kept skipping our table. I had to get up to ask someone for our check as well. It happens!

Our calamari portion was tiny given the price and the pieces were cut very small..flavor was ok but by the time it reached our table it was just about cold--I probably would not order it again it's just not good value.  

Our mains were one each of the Butcher and Diavolo pizzas and a lobster spaghetti.  The pizzas were a reasonable size and were well prepared.  The balsamic drizzle on the Diavolo really gave the chicken a nice zing.  For us the standout of the meal was the lobster spaghetti.  The dish contained decent sized pieces of lobster meat and the Rose sauce was balanced--not too tart or sweet.  Pasta was cooked al dente. Service was excellent.

13680,2,1550361600000,"It's unlikely that I'm ever going to say, ""hey, you know what would be fun on my last day of vacation? Yeah, getting an ultrasound on my leg"". So, I was prepared to be less than excited.  The facility itself is not awesome and the wait was ridiculous. 
They get the four stars because the technician was very helpful and gave me as much information as she could in such a way that I had information without her violating the rules about giving me information. This will make sense to any of you who have had any kind of medical test and you know the technician knows ""stuff"", but they are not allowed to tell you and yet the tech finds a way to tell you. I'm sorry if this is confusing, Maybe we can get a tech to explain it.  I know you know what I mean.
The other thing that brought on the extra stars was having my friend in the room with me.  I had no idea how anxious I was until I got closer to the room. Having my friend in the room helped. The (same) tech was great about letting us talk and pretend that my leg was not being poked and prodded. My friend of course should get 5 stars, but I don't know that she would appreciate being reviewed.
I have been to both Cathedral Rock and the Eastern location. I like the Eastern one better.
I would appreciate some benches or chairs without arms. 
Lastly, great fish tank and if you happen to be there when a  5 year old and a 3 year old are looking at the fish, you are very lucky, indeed. In fact, I might just go back to visit the fish as well as any children visiting the fish.",2
13682,3,1551225600000,"I visited here with another couple friend of ours this past Friday, and was I pleasantly surprised. The four of us split there ""combo"" type dinner and it came out on this massive round tray/bowl with Ethiopian style bread. There were a variety of meats, including beef three ways, lamb, and chicken. There were lentils, peas, green salad, and a few other types of vegetable sides. The food was fantastic to say the least, and the dinning experience is so unique, you eat with your hands and use the bread to prevent you from getting it all over yourself. I truly enjoyed all of the new flavors and the social aspect of Ethiopian dinning.  The prices were also very reasonable, that monster dish was about $40.00. There are native Ethiopian wines and beers available (but I chose to take a night off from the sauce) so I can't tell you if they were good. 

If you are interested in broadening your food horizons I would most certainly suggest trying this place. Staff was also friendly and attentive (important to mention). This place is no frills though, and attire is definitely whatever goes. I think this is good for large groups as well as first dates and small parties!",2

We met up here for a ladies' drinks night.  Since it was Friday, the drink special was Flight Night featuring your choice of 4 beers in a flight for $8.  It was a fantastic idea since Stadt had an amazing draft menu with more than a few brews I was eager to try.

We ordered a few snacks from the menu including the fried artichokes ($11), giant pretzel ($6), Casablanca salad ($9), and wings ($15).  We also wanted the Bavarian platter featuring a selection of meats/cheeses but they were sold out for the night.  

Service was very friendly and they were kind enough to let my wine snob friends sample a few of the white wines before deciding.

Stadt offers a weekend brunch which I'll be back to try for sure.  They make my list of top recommendations for the neighbourhood!",2
13747,1,1548979200000,"I have only stayed in one other hotel in Vegas, but this one is definitely well worth it!  

Although a few people have said that its ""tired"" or ""old,"" I think that it pays homage to the way the hotels and casinos were when the strip was first being built.  This is a 50s-era hotel that still has some original furnishings.  The rooms are great.  I'm not sure what a ""Go Room"" is, but we just had a standard two-double bed room.  Great prices (much less than the other hotels on the strip) and every amenity you can imagine.  Our rooms were big, the beds were super comfortable and the bathroom was really nice.  The hotel service and staff were super friendly and very prompt with the cleaning of the rooms or room service.   The front desk staff were also very friendly and helpful in suggesting things to do during the day if we didn't want to hit up the casinos.  

The casino itself is really great - it's big (almost like three separate rooms) and there's all the card tables and slot machines you could imagine.  I found that the service here at the machines/tables was much faster than at other casinos.  Every time I started playing something a server would come and take a drink order - it was great.  It was often slower or non-existent at other casinos.  

The pools were also great.  There was a pool for everyone (including kids) and a pool for adults only - the adult pool was great because there was prompt bar service and very few people.  The area around the pools is also great, as well.  It's kind of like a crazy rain forest jungle with some wildlife hanging around and a path to walk through and see everything.  

I will definitely plan to stay here again the next time I visit Vegas.  It's an expensive, great hotel right on the strip.",2

This was a great place to stop for a quick scoop of the butter pecan ice cream. The place was packed and seemed great for lunch - especially if you were in the mood for some homestyle 50's comfort food. Service was quick and the ice cream was a great treat.,2
13781,2,1549584000000,We came because they had the half price deal for the Peking duck. Wasn't expecting much since reviews here aren't stellar but was pleasantly surprised.

13782,3,1550188800000,"I'm not a frequenter of Queen East, mainly because I don't really know what's around there but this restaurant has been on my radar since someone told me the story of the famed papier maché nose, which completely intrigued me. 

Finally I got to eat here, although it was a sad occasion (Deanna's departure) it was great to meet up with so many people and just have a great time. Since we were a large party (18 in total), dishes obviously took a little longer to prepare but service remained excellent. 

I was one of the first to arrive and when seated with only 2 others our server came by a few times to ask us if we needed anything or wanted to take drink orders, she made sure our pitchers of water were filled and that we were all set. 

I loved the rustic decor. It was a little dark to see but I noticed the mismatched chairs and the bar stools and tables and the antique wooden buffet that was used as the server station. There is also a ""vault"" in which a party of max. 10 people would be able to enjoy. 

The food was great. Not spectacular but great. I didn't choose anything that was too adventurous to solidify my claim of good food. Scotty's meatball was sub par, it wasn't too special and tasted like there was not enough meat and too much filler. The rigatoni with tomato and basil was really good but don't bother getting the entree size at $14, opt for the appetizer which is half the size for is $7 and the entree size isn't even that big. 

I also tried the fried calamari and it was good, nothing special but it did come with shrimp as well which is always a bonus. I also had the creseulla, some name of that sort which is stuffed pastry with sweet potato and herbs, amazing! It's really good. When I come back, yes I said when, I will be having that for sure! 

Bathrooms are not the typical scary Toronto bathroom but only in the sense that they aren't in the basement. Is it that difficult to put a little bit of money into the nasty rundown bathrooms? Bathrooms are what I deem to be the difference between a nice hotel and a crappy motel, so why do I not have the same rating system for restaurants? Because it's a known fact that Toronto has the grossest bathrooms around. 

I would definitely come back here, regardless of the bathroom situation, it's got a great feel and decent looking servers (re: Kat F's comment of the David Arquette lookalike named Joshua or Joseph) and everyone is laid back and super unpretentious which is a nice change from the stuff I'm used to every day.

We ordered 2 cocktails and the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer.  My SO was a little apprehensive at ""cheese curds"" as an ingredient but he enjoyed the appetizer anyway!  Our server didn't take our entree orders until we were well into our app.  I was concerned about how long they would take to come out, but it wasn't a terrible wait.  We had another round of cocktails to keep us busy.  I forgot to mention the biscuits with apple berry jam and rosemary butter than they bring out.  Soooo good and they taste homemade!  He ordered the Chicken dinner ""late night"" style with a breast and thigh. They have 5 different ways to serve it available.  He said the mac and cheese and collard greens were perfect and well seasoned.  The chicken had a batter that wasn't too thick and was fried crispy, the meat was juicy.  I had pointed out that he didn't use any hot sauce (which he uses at most meals) and he replied ""there's nothing to add to this."" He's a black hole and couldn't even finish everything but was super excited for the leftovers!  I got the Lowcountry boil which was delicious.  For those who keep count, I only got 2 shrimp, but 4 crab claws.  I imagine they just scoop this out of a big pot, so everyone's serving may be different.  It was really tasty and I was glad for my ""soppin toast"" to soak up the beer broth.  I couldn't finish my meal either.  We inquired about dessert, but they only had beignets and pecan pie.  Neither of which interested me.  All in all service and food was spot on.  I'd recommend and go back in a heartbeat!",2

The interior design is not only beautiful but so efficient too! Somehow a garage became an INSTA-WORTHY environment. The light fixtures and simplistic design  ultimately create the perfect spot for studying, catching up with an old friend, or relaxing on your own.

Unlike most cafes, this place has PLENTY of seating! Not only that, but there are booths in which you can adjust the lighting and have your own personal outlets!

Another bonus? FREE WI-FI! The password is posted where the trash cans, napkins, sugar and cream are.

How is the food?
The menu is perfect! Not too overwhelming nor is it limiting. The Banh Mi sandwiches are made with care and taste super fresh! You can choose among 4 types!

And the drinks?
Honestly the coffee is so good! It definitely tastes fresh and authentic, which means a lot coming from me because I'm super picky with my coffee! I got the Iced Vanilla Latte (as I was craving something sweet). You can ask for skim or whole milk. They even sell Vietnamese Drip Coffee! And they grind their beans to order! I have yet to try the bubble tea, but I have no doubt that it will be of quality as I've seen so many customers order the green tea!

The bathrooms are clean and the service is so friendly! The guy who owns the place so evidently cares for the customers and puts his heart into his work! He talks to customers to see how he can improve the experience for everyone.

I'm MOST DEFINITELY coming back! I low-key (selfishly) want to keep this place to myself, but I already know that I can't stop the buzz! And I wish the workers and the owner the best, though I'm confident they don't need luck with the overall quality of this business.

UPDATE:
They now have chicken pho on the menu! Have yet to try it myself but it sounds promising.

The manager Ben is super super cool! The service here is exceptionally patient, helpful and personable. Can't say that about most places.

I tried the bubble tea (Raspberry Green Tea with ""1"" sweetness and Pomegranate Popping Boba) and it was perfectly refreshing and fruity for a sunny day. Would get again! Excited to try other flavors and toppings. They offer non-dairy milk options (soy and almond milks), which is amazing.

He told us that we definitely have bed bugs in the one room. But he recommended is doing the whole house.  I told him we were on a budget and he was very willing to work with my budget.

My all time favorite dish is the bean and cheese nachos. It's super cheap and huge. Grab a few friends so you can finish it but it is absolutely delicious! Definitely worth it.

The atmosphere is usually very loud and always on the move. It can be hard to find a table especially around the evening rush. If you end up outside beware of the side by the misters. Many are broken and will just leak water all over you. 

As for parking, they have abundant metered parking outside but it is often limited. So keep that in mind.

Will do things short for readers:

Waitress was amazing getting a table for us almost immediately, in the meantime Mariachi was singing great authentic Mexican Songs.
Table ready, chips came in a SNAP along with a couple of salsas that I define as grandma's!..............I love spicy salsas and food, so I asked for a hotter salsa to dip my chips, but I believe I overestimated the chef. Habanero salsa must be treated with an Ice Cold Negra Modelo and a slice of lime.
Food was as good as it gets, second to none!! 
I had a combo, so I could taste 3 different dishes all at once. I had # 1: carnitas quesadilla, chile relleno and enchilada. The way they teat pork is amazing, very tasteful meat melted with the cheese and wrapped in a carefully flour tortillita!
Chile relleno was great. Mid size Poblano filled and battered at its best. I critique cooks that don't do it the way my grandma does (the batter), but Hussongs' cooks must have traveled to her to learn;   batter was very fluffy, simply cooked to perfection. 

Try their ""El Pepino"" drink if you are up for a spicy and fresh tequila drink.

I'll be back and most likely bring locals to try this restaurant. It is DEFINITELY                N O T   your regular casino, mass produced, flavorless restaurant, you will tell, I promise.

Some of the hard things to accept are the wine prices..Paying $98 for a $28 bottle is not easy to swallow.  The wine is good but not worth $98.  So you can imaging what it will cost for a higher quality wine.  The pate and pop overs were nice.  The service was spotty throughout the meal and at these prices a real let down.  Several items we ordered were not even delivered.  The pacing was painful even on a slow Thursday night.  The salad was high quality and big enough to share.  The meat was cooked perfectly and full of flavor even with no sauce which they charge $3 for?  When you mark up the wine 300% it seems insulting to charge for sauce.  Sides were just OK with the Au gratin potatoes being on the small side. I did not try the deserts but the ones that did get ordered didn't survive for long.

Here's how I found out: I recently tried to leave Desert View, and Stacie. As much as I wanted to stay with Stacie I just couldn't handle her front office staff any longer.  

I went to another doctor that came very highly recommended and I was so disappointed I just took my lab work with the intent of just braving the horrible office staff so that I could have Stacie read my lab results.  She really was the only one I trusted with helping me decide my next steps on this particular illness. 

I was glad I tried to go back because when I called...

...my call was answered inside minutes,

...on a Tuesday morning,

...by a human,

...who was helpful.

The experience in the office followed suit.  A nice lady copied my card, another nice lady took my co-payment, and yet another nice lady called my name and got me ready to see Stacie.  

It's the best of both worlds now!  If you have a doctor there that you love, you can feel good about yourself again because you are no longer putting yourself through the degrading hell that you once did.  You ARE a person!  Desert View Family Medicine (evidently) knows it too!

I normally go there M-T-W mid-afternoons, making an appt unless the guy they have answering their phone can't speak good English. They DO take walk-in, but when you just walk in they don't speak or acknowledge you you must go up and ask for the nail tech you prefer and deal with them. They have many Mani & pedi chairs, their price is competitive, but you MUST tip in $$, not added to your card.

My #1 issue is the cleanliness of the nail tools~~Unless you bring your own, they use whatever was used on the previous client out of a drawer/kit and often share between one another while doing my nails. Most times it is myself & maybe one or two others in the shop with 20+ empty chairs. I'm not sure what has changed with their move,  but I am looking elsewhere now.

Obviously irritated we would have the audacity to ask a question, she was a bit terse.  Since it was happy hour, and half the tables were occupied and half were reserved, we excused ourselves to what ended up being a much better happy hour elsewhere.

In the server's defense working the patio, he was apologetic when inquiring why we were leaving.  He wanted to know if we wanted him to inquire about the wait inside, and we said no thank you, as we had already wasted over 35 minutes of our ""happy"" time.

Tasted like canned soup watered down. Brussel sprout Caesar salad contained chunks of bitter red cabbage and barely discernible traces of Brussel sprouts. I thought well at least there is dessert. How can warm peanut butter cup with chocolate gelato be bad? It can, trust me. It was a bowl of molten oversweetened peanut butter pudding with the tiniest portion of chocolate gelato known to man.

14004,2,1549584000000,"We got a chance to go through a good bit of the menu here with a large group of friends while eating our way through Las Vegas. There was a large bottle of whiskey involved, and lots of interesting, very Thai dishes. 

Krung is one of the best places in the Vegas area to get excellent Thai food, and not have to rush to get there before they close. After having approximately half of the menu, I can say (from what I can remember) I'm pretty sure you'll love just about anything here, especially if you go beyond the basic tom yum / pad thai / curry something / basil chicken routine. 

I really loved the Pad See Ew here. It had the characteristic smoky wok fragrance, rich, fat rice noodles and a balance of sweet and savory that makes all the calories worth it. A common problem with this dish is that it is too oily and/or it was not cooked over super high heat using proper wok technique. This one is perfect though, in every way. It's nice to add a bit of pepper vinegar and roasted pepper flakes to taste - and many Thai do this. Condiments are available for this purpose.

Lao style papaya salad! Juicy, sweet, sour, palette cleansing, stomach settling vibrance of green papaya and spicy - the kind of spicy you need to work up to. I maintain a pretty high tolerance to this heat level, as I eat this dish pretty often. I ended up destroying most of the first serving. I seemed to have forgotten we were sharing and so we ended up getting another one lol. I really get a taste for this when I've had some whiskey, which leads me to another thing I like with whiskey: 

Naem. I do remember some sort of naem platter, and I do love naem - especially with whiskey. Problem is, by then I was past the point of woodford and into the Johnny Walker level. So, I know little more beyond this point. We don't often eat dessert, and I'm not sure if we did or not. After that we were in a lyft back to the strip and all that follows is a blur. 

A thought: to expand beyond the farang basics in Thai food, one must realize first that Thailand is a whole universe of food that will never be fully represented by curries and heaps of basil stir fried meats+veg. So. Try something with noodles, try something with fish, and ask your waiter for recommendations. Krung is a great place to do this. 

Krung was a high point in a trip where I learned Bouchon is not as good as it used to be, and the Russian burger bar I've been wanting to try is gone. I'm glad I got a chance to come out here, and I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Las Vegas. : )",2

I had asked to speak to the mechanic that would be working on my car so I could explain to him what parts had already been worked on and which parts needed to be looked at. They said they will look at my car and get back to me. Apparently they didn't want any input from me because they are the experts and I am just a 'little girl' that wouldn't know anything about cars. I was quoted a price of $75 to put a UV liquid in my A/C line to detect the leak (even though I could of got a leak detector from the store for $5) - then the final price turned out to be double what I was quoted!

I love that it is the exact same menu, but the wait times seem to be shorter. Not only that, but they seem to be just as consistent.

They will use egg white or Pam instead of butter upon request and they are really good about substituting potatoes or breads whereas a lot of other restraints are more difficult about these things or you don't know how something is being cooked. Aside from just being able to get a healthy breakfast, their scrambles are delicious!

14058,2,1550534400000,"I was super excited to see there was a drive thru, thought I could swing by on lunch and get a great burger. Well I  was wrong and here is why... I pull up to the drive thru and I'm asked to hold on a moment, that moment was more like 8 minutes. I order my food and pull up to the window to pay and then I wait another 10 minutes for my BBQ cheeseburger... I was so disappointed that I wasn't given ketchup for my fries or napkins, like seriously wth... I begin to eat my burger and it was dry as eff, so not worth the $11.54 I spent. I'll stick to the location by my house, they are so much better.  Good luck on your visit!",2
14059,1,1550707200000,"The husband and I dined at Täko last night and had a fantastic evening! The hostess team was bubbly and got us to our table as soon as we arrived. Super cool vibe with great music! On the dark side with great lighting! Our server was prompt and knowledgable! My husband got the sage margarita! Five stars! They have a nice non alcoholic list for folks (like me) who are going booze free for a short period of time ;). The food... A mix of 3 and 5 stars to us. Great flavors but... Soooo extremely spicy/hot! The menu does NOT specify how spicy the food is going to be! We will definitely give Täko another try, especially for drinks!",2
14070,1,1551052800000,"Came here for our wedding anniversary. The drinks selection (especially the vast wine selection) was impressive. I had the sangria and it was great; they are generous with the alcohol. My husbands drink was strong,  but nobody is complaining here. The complimentary bread is amazing! The pretzel bread is to die for. I had the salmon and my husband had the swordfish; cooked perfectly.  Sides: lobster mashed potatoes and truffle wild mushrooms. Wow!! The mashed potatoes had these enormous chunks of lobster, exquisite! We come here every year for our anniversary and this time didn't opt for dessert, but if you do the butter cake is amazing! My only thing is that they should keep the military discount consistent, depending on the server our total percentage discount  will always vary.",2
14070,2,1551312000000,"The service was excellent and my dinner (rigatoni with duck confit) was excellent (as was the brussels sprout appetizer).  However, my husband ordered the short ribs and they were inedible.  Crazy fatty and tough - not like any properly prepared short rib I've ever had.  We were informed they were prepared ""sous vide"" as if that should justify how unappetizing they were, and with a tone that maybe we're just not sophisticated enough to appreciate them. They did offer to replace it and did so, but only with a further condescending remark about how steaks have fat.  I mean really.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt given the ratings, but this is the second inedible meal I've received from them. I couldn't help feeling that the emperor has no clothes. We will not be returning.",2
14074,2,1550966400000,"I had high expectation after seeing the review and the pictures in terms of decor. I went there on a rainy Wednesday night and as I walked in, I felt the entrance was a little bit empty. However as I walked towards the back, it looked more cozy with the leather chairs and old school decor. 

The cocktail menu is short but diversified. Will definitely come back on the weekend to reassess",2
14075,3,1549497600000,Great food. Good service. Good for small groups. I enjoyed the lemongrass chicken with ginger tea.,2

14092,3,1550275200000,"Probably the grossest hotel I've ever stayed in. We were there for 3 nights. We had a non smoking room, but apparently in the south tower it is mostly smoking so our room smelled like cigarettes every time another room above or below is was smoking. Our sheets smelled & the room smelled. The fixtures in the bathroom were falling off. The paint on the walls was chipped. & to top it off the second night we have COCKROACHES crawling on the walls & floor. Went to the front desk to move rooms after that & they couldn't do anything about it. Made me fill out a report & now I have to call costumer relations myself. They wouldn't comp the room for the night or give us any compensation at all.

That place is absolutely disgusting & the customer service is awful.

Only nice thing about it is it's right across from Fremont st, but then again Fremont st is gross as well.",2
14095,2,1551052800000,"Its about time a real bbq opened in Calgary. Great food, cold beer and fantastic service. What else can you ask for. Brisket melts in your mouth, Turkey is very juicy and flavourful, hotlinks were the perfect mixture of hot and tasty. Good Job Hayden Block!",2
14097,2,1551312000000,Great food.  Large portions.  Moderately priced.  Nice decor.  Tasty food.  Convenient location.  Variety of meal options.  Clean bathroom.  The staff are friendly.  Check Groupon because they are always on it for even more meal discount.,2
14103,1,1551052800000,"My family and I stopped in here for a nice afternoon treat today. My husband and I stopped by, the other week, when they were doing their soft opening days and they had already closed,  but the Owner (he told us his name the first time and I hate that I've forgotten it :( ), who is SO gracious and pleasant, told us that their hours that week were short and he invited us to ""please come again"". So we did and I'm so happy that we did. Amina was very patient with our orders, there were four of us. The barista (i didn't catch her name) seemed very knowledgable and she prepared a dynamite traditional macchiato for my husband. The ice cream selections are sufficient and the additional treat selections look very tasty. One of us had the chocolate chip cookie and another of us had the brownie, they were both amazing.  The decor is unlike any of the other dessert/coffee shops in the area. The whole place is very aesthetically pleasing. Please stop in and check them out. The customer service is impeccable and their dessert game is on point!",2
14106,1,1550361600000,"Very disappointed. I'm a long time Anthro Perks member and have had a terrible experience with a price adjustment this weekend. I was told last week when I bought items at full price to ""just call in"" if/when I received a coupon code. As I knew it was just a matter of time these full priced items could be purchased with a discount. This weekend they ran 20% off. I called the anthro customer service number and they could not do it because the items were purchased in store and not online. I called the store sat and was put on hold for 14 min and then hung up on. Called back and was told they can do it but I would have to wait for a register to open up. Called back Sunday and was told to just come in for the price adjustment (I was out of town in DC). Then I was told they would call me back to do the price adjustment when they were less busy yesterday... no one called. Every person I spoke to acknowledged they could do the price adjustment over the phone, but no one was doing it. 20% on a $400+ order is enough to want the adjustment.",2

Education for all.  Was pretty empty in the restaurant and bar.",2

14119,3,1551052800000,"While Jennifer was very kind and understanding when I had to reschedule due to a medical emergency, unfortunately I felt she was a bit vague in the things she was relaying. 

The medium I previously used is no longer taking on individual clients so I was on the search for someone new and upon seeing the amazing reviews here I made the appointment. 

If you are looking for a very general guidance this would be a good reading for you. I personally was looking for something a little more specific, more along the lines of what I received in the past.",2

Hidden GEM!!",2
14133,3,1550880000000,"Considering I've lived in the NYC area my entire life, I would have never thought that the best pizza I ever had would be in Nevada. I make a point to stop here...not every time I'm in Las Vegas but everyday I'm in Las Vegas.",2
14136,1,1549584000000,"Love this place!! Went to Upstairs with a large group of girls visiting Montreal for a Bachelorette Party on the first night of our trip. Our reservation was for 7:30P, so just enough time to get settled in and order a cocktail before the show started at 8:00P. We did order dinner there, which honestly wasn't the best meal ever (I ordered the seafood dish and it was sort of bland), but the music made up for that, and more. The pianist, drummer, and singer were insanely talented and played songs in both English and French. So happy we went there!",2
14151,1,1550793600000,"The pizza at Gionino's is amazing. Full of toppings and great on flavor. I drive 25 minutes to pick up this pie! If you haven't tried it yet, what are you waiting on? Go there now!",2
14151,2,1549670400000,I came here for Summerlicious and I found the food to be really good! I especially enjoyed my dessert - profiteroles with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce! There were a few things that I wasn't too thrilled about though - I found the restaurant to be very tiny and cramped. Conversations were somewhat awkward since I was sitting directly next to another customer. I also didn't find the risotto very filling which was a bit of a shame since I found it to be quite tasty! My overall take on Midi - good food with great prices!,1
14155,3,1551312000000,"Due to my level of pain, they fit me into their schedule so that I did not have to wait any longer than necessary. They were quick ,professional, and extremely helpful. I will definitely go back here for my regular care.",1
14157,2,1550966400000,"First time, love the extensive menu.  Turned off a little by the condiments on the table...crusty and dirty bottles.  They need a good cleaning before refilling.",2
14158,3,1550620800000,"My friend told me to check this place out a while ago and I've bookmarked it in my phone. Today, I finally made my way to CoCo to try their bubble teas for the first time. 

Service: A friendly young lady at the counter, I loved how she greeted every customer with a smile. 

The line moved slowly- there were a few people waiting with their receipts (a receipt has your order number).


Drink: I ordered matcha milk tea with 50% sugar & tapioca. I'm glad that I asked the lady at the counter before ordering since even with 50% sugar, the drink was still a bit sweet. 

I love tapioca and I have a sweet tooth- but the tapioca from here were way too sweet. It felt like I was chewing sugar balls, so by the end, it was difficult to try to finish them.

Next time, I would order another bubble tea with 30% sugar & without tapioca. 


It seems that CoCo's bubble teas are on the sweet side. I would recommend people to order their drinks with 50% or less sugar, or, with more ice!",2
14165,1,1551052800000,It is the perfect combination between funny and magic. It is very good and it is for the whole family. Recommend by me.,2
14167,2,1550188800000,The worst sonic ever. Not only were they not busy. They forgot my number 6 and also order an order of fries and literally got only 14 fries. The am carton was only half way filled. It's  ridiculous. Not to mention I live 15 minutes away. Bull shit.i,2
14168,3,1550620800000,"While not a big fan of Bobby Flay, I suppose I do respect his talent as a restaurateur. Mesa Grill is a worthy result of that talent. Have dined at Mesa Grill twice now, with an impending trip again next month. Have been once for brunch and once for dinner.

Chilaquiles and a burger at brunch. GF thought the chilaquiles were off the chart good, the burger also was good. One of the strengths here are the sauces. The jalapeno cheese rolls are definitely a winner. For dinner, the Pork Tenderloin is a tremendous dish as well as the signature tamale with grilled shrimp. Some sort of deconstructed berry cobbler for dessert was also very good.

At both visits we indulged in the best restaurant margaritas we have ever had. One can choose from a pretty wide variety of tequilas to include.

The service has been exemplary. Top notch. No complaints, which is high praise.",1
14179,1,1549497600000,"We recently drove to Las Vegas to get married and spent a few days before and after the wedding ceremony at the South Point Hotel and Casino.

They have excellent rates available to begin with but we were able to take advantage of their Super Saver rates during our stay.  Further, we were upgraded to a spacious room on the 24th floor with a nice view of the pool area when the hotel staff realized that we were getting married!

The hotel is newer, the rooms are clean and spacious, the service is excellent and there are a variety of resturants and activities to choose from.

The only thing I did not enjoy was having to walk through the casino to reach the reservation desk from the garage elevators.  I was carrying my wedding dress and did not appreciate the cigarette smell lingering in the casino.  The same was true on the day of our wedding.  My husband and I had to walk through the casino in our wedding attire to reach the front doors where the limo was picking us up.  I would have preferred a clean lobby any day.

All in all, our stay at the South Point was very enjoyable.  We tried their Garden buffet for dinner and breakfast as well as their Italian restaurant called Don Vito's, which I would highly recommend.

We also spent an evening soaking in their hot tub located outside in the pool area.  It was a good size with water falls and not overly crowded.

I would definitely recommend this hotel but be warned that is is pretty far south on Las Vegas Blvd. and somewhat isolated.  The good thing is that the parking is free so if you have a car, the location is not a problem.",3
14182,3,1549238400000,"Two most important aspects of a restaurant is food and service, which Bar Louie lacks!  We had lunch there today and after a 40-minute wait, lunch arrived.  I had ordered German Pork Schnitzel which was hard as a rock and totally over fried.  Our drinks never made it to the table. We had to take a few bites, mind you my lunch needed a Black & Decker to cut thru the schnitzel!!
The waitress must have been in a bad mood as she made an angry face bringing lunch over and totally ignored our request when we asked how much longer before our meals were served.
Bar Louie has ample seating area inside and out.
I do not recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good food and good service.",2

EVERYTHING.  You seriously cannot go wrong with anything on the menu and I am a picky eater.  They were accomodating to our party of 12 and on top of bringing drinks and food in a timely manner and they were packed that night.  The staff was always friendly and never looked a bit stressed or flustered, which you sometimes get at busy restaurants.  This place is top-notch!!  The first time I was there, I provided my email address to get updates and they sent me an email on my birthday that I could get any dessert for free next door at Churn.  So awesome!",2

Two things stood out; 1) While all of the food was excellent, the seared foie gras entree was unbelievable!; 2) Our server was quick without making us feel rushed, engaging, and extremely helpful when it came to choosing our wines and food courses.

We got to PNC Park around 5 p.m. and since the gates weren't open we decided to sit and have some drinks before the game.  We stopped first at Atria's.  Although there was only one other table occupied outside, we were told if we weren't going to order food (just drink) we would have to give up our table if people, who were eating food needed it.  This was RIDICULOUS  to us so we left!  We were paying guests just like their other guests!!  Anyway we went a few businesses down and drank at Dominic's.  We went to Dominic's both nights and probably spent close to $100 AND did up getting FOOD.  Atria's better rethink how they treat guests....",3

I tried it and it's good & healthier but a little bit of salty maybe it depends on the taste bud.
A friendly advice-don't compare their fresh lumpia to the one you had back in Phil.or never put an expectation as they have a diff.version. 
-Bangsilog: it is so yummy plus they have this unique vinegar, and 2 eggs :-) worthe the pay.

More than 5 stars for the service, met ""Tess"" and she accomodated me and provided my needs. Always ask if I'm doing ok and if i need anything and she wears a ""SMILE"" that makes your day enlightened. 
Really never had a best service like this before. Will definitely come back!!!

I got tom yum with flat noodles and seafood and it definitely was not like regular tom yum. It was better!!! 
The green curry was okay. My fave is probably yellow out of all of them. 

The place is pretty small but everyone that works here is super nice. We came at the right time because after we sat down it was really crowded. 

The bill came out to less than 20$ for delicious food :)",2

Unfortunately I ended up throwing it away and having a P and J for dinner. I'll never go back to this place.",2

Well the fries  took forever to arrive coming just as I finished the beer, so of course I had to order another. Also asked for vinegar for the fries.  Beer came. Finished second beer and fries just as the vinegar arrived. Not like I ate exceptionally fast. I was there for almost hour and a half. :-(
Not sure I'm coming back any more.",1

Oxtail fried rice (excellent)
House oysters (good, small)
Garlic serrano wings (very good)
Pork belly bao (very good)
Fish tacos (good, very small)

  The decor is very nice inside and they have a very cool bar setup.   I will definitely come again.

Oxtail Pho (excellent)
Oxtail fried rice, again (superb, hard to believe better than the first time!)

Am bumping to 4 because the food is that good and everyone who has gone with me has enjoyed the decor/service.   They even split the Pho for us, no problem.

And the food......WOW!  We split an Oreganos special salad and a Bistro Pizza!  The salad was perfect, super cold and not too much dressing and perfect to split.

Located on the second floor, the spa is small - there's two showers, two bathroom stalls, and a dry suana, as well as two tiny waiting areas. It is definitely not a spa to hang out in or spend the day; however, it was more than enough to spend an hour waiting for services. 
We walked by the hotel pool which looked really nice!You have access with a spa service.
Btw, they validate for the valet.

Facials were great! Christine was wonderful, and very knowledgeable. 

Overall a great treatments at a serviceable spa (although very cute hotel); worth checking out if you are in the area but probably not worth a special trip.",2

Tiny portions for high prices  = not a good pairing.  I looked at the menu ahead of time and the descriptions sounded delicious.  Most of the items I tried were very disappointing.

I had the Sourdough Waffles.  I don't really understand what all the excitement is regarding the vanilla bean butter.  It didn't taste like anything.  Honestly I wasn't blown away by the waffles either.  They weren't bad but I have had comparable ones at local diners.  

The bf had one of the specials.  I don't remember what it was but he said it wasn't too great and he was still hungry after our meal.

We also ordered the fries to split.  I really only ordered these because so many people raved about it.  Now I'm beginning to think that people were just being sarcastic.  They are just regular fries.  Mickey D's makes them better.  The frozen ones you buy at the store to fry up at home taste better.  We didn't finish them and one of the busboys said, ""No one ever finishes the fries.""

What I did like about Bouchon was the atmosphere.  It was so nice to have brunch in such a beautiful setting.  We sat indoors because it was a little windy that day but I would definitely opt to sit outside if the weather is right.  It looked really pretty out there.

Overall, I thought the location and service were top-notch but the food just not worth the price.  I am willing to come here again and order something different.",1

Each employee took time to make friends with Lucy before completing their tasks. They explained each step of the process to me, and answered my every question. The vet called me after the surgery to give me a report. I am glad I found this vet, and we will definitely make this our home animal hospital.

EVERYTHING was thoughtfully crafted and prepared.  The cocktail menu made me wish I could spend more time there exploring.  The menu was a great assortment of southwestern and smokehouse classics.  The baby back ribs were meaty and fall off the bone tender, with a great smoked-on sauce, and the cornbread was moist and hearty. I can't wait to come back and try desserts!",2

14359,1,1550966400000,"Fairly new and deserving of the high ratings it's received so far.  Smokin' Crawfish is not unlike your other seafood-boil-in-a-bag places such as Hot n Juicy or The Boiling Crab.  In fact, some of the flavors are just as good or possibly better than their rivals and at reasonable prices (about a $1 less than the latter two for a lb. of shrimp).

When we arrived one night, we were the only customers there.  It's kind of weird and unexpected but at other crawfish places you might have to wait to be seated.  The positive to this is no waiting and food in front of you as quickly as you can order!

The downside is the missing amazing aroma in the air as you walk into a busy crawfish spot.  I swear, with just one whiff of that garlicky, lemon peppery, amazing fragrance in the air and you'll have me salivating more puddles than Pavlov's dog.  That sets the tone for the rest of the night and something I like when I go to a crawfish spot.  Won't be the case here when you're the only diners at the time.

The two pounds of shrimp we ordered were nice-sized shrimp and there were plenty of shrimp in the bag.  As a tip for new customers who have never ate at these types of joints, ask for plastic gloves if you don't want to get your hands dirty because you'll be peeling the shrimp and your hands will smell like the Smokin' Crawfish sauce the next day.

I also enjoyed their own take on fried rice made with shrimp and crawfish!  It was yummy.

The service was fine but hard to rate because we were the only ones there.  As this place gets popular, we'll have to see if their staff could keep up.  I believe there was only one or maybe a second server there at that time.

To end on a cool note, they have the Lobster claw machine game here.  If you manage to catch a lobster, they will cook it for you for free!   Maybe this one instance I'll forget what my parents preached to me a long time ago while I play with my food for just a little bit.",2

This particular store, the one that started me on coffee, is located right next to the falls. It's usually crowded and can be hard to navigate- especially in the summer, when you can frequently find a large group of bikers hanging around.

It was a lovely evening in downtown Phoenix and we sat outside in their small patio.

Service was friendly and efficient.  I thought the wine list was a little limited and pricey, but the menu was interesting and fairly broad.

I could not have imagined a better unforgettable experience. The excitement and joy was so organic and it's all because of the CREW. Our float was scheduled to take off around 6am and we arrived around 5:15am.  They provided coffee and pastries. The way they brew the coffee was even fun to watch (they use a chemex). You meet outside in their side patio where they have lights decorating the trees, a picnic table with coffee and pastries. Our float took off around 6am and landed after a couple hours. The float was perfect. Everything went smoothly and the view was spectacular. When we landed, the crew set up a picnic table with thoughtful decorations. Everything was so well thought out, you can just feel how hard the crew works to make the experience unforgettable. The crew cooks breakfast which is all local produce from the Phoenix farmers market. While a few crew members cook breakfast you have one crew member mixing a prickly pear champagne beverage  for a toast! While the drink is being prepared you are learning fun facts about how floating all started. So much excitement from the chemex, floating, toast and breakfast. I had a smile on my face the entire time. BEST hot air balloon experience. The crew is so great and thoughtful. Thank you to

The sides were mostly great. Loved the loaded sweet potato and the bacon wrapped corn.

Service was amazing. Ordered the XL online and when the driver showed up he informed me they had ran out of XL dough balls so they brought a large and a small! You don't see customer service like that very often anymore. 

All in all very satisfied 10/10 customer service and food quality both greatly exceeded my expectations. I will definitely be ordering from Tomatoes II again!",2
14566,1,1549756800000,"Two stars because my A/C works now and they came out on a Sunday, that's about the only positive with my experience. 

Here we go...

Saturday night around 6pm, My A/C quit. Obviously that's not great timing. I called up American Home Water & Air and was pleased to have somebody answer. The man on the phone was polite and said he'd have somebody out the next morning. That was fine with me. My wife, infant, and myself checked into a local hotel for the night. 

Sunday morning the repair tech arrived as promised. Within 10 minutes, he had ""fixed"" the unit. He was really happy that his first call was an ""easy"" one. Obviously so was I. Unfortunately about 10 minutes later, he came back in and said the motor had now gone out and it would be another $600. Ouch. Good news was he had the part on this truck. Ok then, it is what it is I guess. It seemed odd how this transpired, but ultimately I was fine with it. 

After about an hour or so of installing the new motor, I felt cold air coming in again. He came down and said that while it's working, there's yet another repair that needs to be done. He said that while installing the new motor, he wasn't able to use the existing fan blade which was ""out of pitch"". Also, he didn't have the part with him. I asked how much that's going to be, and he said ""A hundred and something"" but it couldn't be installed until Monday morning. At that point it was starting to get annoying, but I said fine, let's do it. I also remarked that I might not be home Monday morning, but he can access the roof as needed. He said that's fine. 

Come Monday morning, my wife and infant are home when he arrives. He tells her ""It's going to be another $300"" in a rude manner. Obviously she doesn't really know what's going on, so just says ok and he goes on the roof to fix the fan. After completing the work, he knocks on the door again. My wife answers, and he just forced his way into the house and starts measuring vents. No ""May I come in"" or anything like that. That's just not professional and made my wife uncomfortable. 

This company may have worked out great for some yelpers, but I wouldn't use them again.",2

Kudos to the young man in the Kitten Room who suggested we come early before they open because new kittens are brought in from their Foster Homes.  I was heartbroken to learn the kitten I loved had been adopted after we left. Suddenly, a Siamese mix little sweetie was brought  in and I scooped her up & within 40 minutes we were on the way home.

14590,2,1550361600000,"In August of 2016 my husband bought a 2002 Dodge Ram with 30,000 miles on it and also got the platinum extended warranty from the Autonation Buick GMC in Henderson, NV. We had no issues with it..... Fast forward to August of 2017 while my husband is on the trucks first road trip to Phoenix the check engine light comes on. He gets to Arizona and the next day goes to take it to an Autonation Dodge in Phoenix. The truck would not stay on, so he called a tow truck. While at the dealership we are informed it is a sensor and the warranty will not cover the replacement, because it has been glued together. To say we were pissed is an understatement. To make matters worse the sensor has to be ordered and the only sensor is in Los Angeles. My husband is now stuck in Phoenix. This is a Friday afternoon and the service advisor tells my husband he won't get the part until Tuesday morning. My husband books his hotel till Wednesday, so he has a place to wait. No rental vehicle was offered. He was literally stuck. He gets a call Monday morning telling him the fuel pump is going out and that the warranty will pay for that. He finally gets the truck back Monday afternoon. We can't get a refund on the extra days of the hotel pre booked. He gets home Wednesday afternoon and on Thursday the truck stops working again. We had to pay for a tow this time because it hasn't been 7 full days since the last tow. We get it towed to the Autonation Buick GMC in Henderson, NV because that is where we bought it and it is an Autonation warranty. When the truck gets there the service advisor tells him there is nothing they can do for him and he needs to take it to a dodge dealership. If we had known the warranty worked at any dodge dealership we would have done that in the first place. We get it to a dodge dealership around the corner and they tell us it is a sensor. We ended up trading in the truck for a 2017 Ram. 
      I started the process of getting our money back from the warranty company (Consumer Program Administrators) for the hotel stay and wanted them to reimburse us for the sensor. My husband and I aren't car mechanics and would never think to glue a sensor together and why would we, we have the platinum warranty package. It took 2 months to get a refund. I went back and forth with the warranty company. I sent them the same paperwork four times. I faxed it and emailed it. They responded with a check for $145!!!! Are you kidding me?!?! We paid $824 total for the hotel room and sensor repair. I called and demanded they reeval the paper work sent to them. We finally got a check for $800 after months of fighting and going back and forth.
   On October 10, 2017 I started the process of canceling the extended warranty and getting a refund from that. I sent in all the paperwork and on October 30, 2017 it was finally cancelled. I emailed the Finance Manager Tamara at the Henderson Autonation to follow up on October 31, 2017 and she said to give it a week since it had just been cancelled. I followed up on 11/6/2017 with an email and she stated something was wrong with our address. We had moved, but put in a change of address with the Post Office, so any mail would have been forwarded. I gave her the new address and she said she spoke to someone in the Texas location and that the check would be sent out by Friday 11/10/2017 or even sooner. Friday was a federal holiday, so I just guessed it would be sent out no later than Monday 11/10/2017.  Tamara the finance manager has stopped responding to my emails.  I sent a Facebook message to Autonation on Friday 11/17/2017 to get help. They responded on Monday 11/20/17 asking that I email customer care and they would be able to help me further. I sent an email to customer care the morning of 11/20/2017. 
 At 4pm on 11/20/17 Susan with Henderson Buick GMC Autonation called and left me a message that she was researching the cancellation and that a check was sent out on 11/17/17 an entire week after it was supposed to be sent out.
On 11/21/17 I called Susan back and left a message. I thanked her for checking on things and asked her to call me back with the update after she spoke to whoever she needed to speak to. I got a call back and Susan was very short and seemed like calling me was a chore. She informed me the check wasn't actually sent out until 11/20/17 and it is coming from Texas. She double checked the mailing address and abruptly ended the call.
 We finally received the refund check on 11/24/17. 
     I swear whenever I talk to anyone that has to do with Autonation or Consumer Program Administrators I get different answers to the same questions. If you enjoy arguing with people, calling and emailing then this is the place for you.  We will never buy a vehicle from Autonation again.",2

He could steer and press the gas pedal all while watching his favorite show, Blaze! I told Maira about him and she was not frazzled in the least!

14640,2,1551312000000,"A friend chose this place for a Summerlicious dinner catchup date, and I remember saying to her at least twice, ""Good choice!""

They had an outdoor patio option which I opted out of, since the clouds were threatening to break open.  Walking into the Hazelton Hotel (where ONE was located) lobby, I was a little blinded by the darkness but impressed nonetheless by the spaciousness and cool decor.  It was a bit of an early dinner so the tables were mostly empty; we were seated at a nice table by the window, where we could somewhat see the patio diners through mesh curtains.

Onto the food -- I decided to go with a Corn & Crab Chowder, Boneless Pork Rack, and Chocolate Cheesecake for my three courses.  My friend chose Pork Belly, Eggplant Parmesan, and Ontario Fruit Crumble.  

I wish I got the pork belly too -- but didn't, since I was already having a pork entree -- because it was AMAZING!  She shared a bite with me and it was literally melt-in-your-mouth marinated.  The first impression I had was how flavourful everything was - the avocado puree, yuzu, etc. all had really strong flavours (bordering on overwhelming, but managed to stay delicious).  My chowder came in a white bowl as a clump of corn and assorted bits on the bottom; both of us were staring confusedly at this tiny portion, until the server conjured up a kettle of warm soup that he poured into the bowl.  Too bad I didn't get to record this transformation happening - it was so unexpected.

My pork entree was a little disappointing; I don't remember much about it, maybe because I was so blown away by how great my friend's eggplant tasted.  Personally, I dislike eggplant, and am a little allergic.  I could not believe they could make eggplant taste so good!  The crispy coating added just the right amount of texture, and again everything was high in flavour.  Returning to my own dish, I barely managed to finish the pork and the asparagus since we were both already full.

Finishing up the meal were our desserts, which were less than spectacular.  She said the fruit crumble was not very good, and my chocolate cheesecake was just average.  It had a couple chunks of 'honey comb' (same hard candy as Crunchie bars) which I wasn't a fan of, and caramel sauce.

Overall a great dining experience though; still can't get over that pork belly even a week later.  I will most likely be returning sometime in the future! :)",1

14673,1,1550188800000,"Hotel Indigo, you're pretty good. I'm feeling concise today, so thought my review would best be expressed by list.

Let's start with the high points:
1) Simple yet artful decor. At first I was taken aback, but I've come to grow to love the close-up cacti wallpaper (think, electron microscope close) in my room. 
2) Large rooms. The closet space is a tad cramped for my liking, but it works. Although I don't totally get the arm hole in the glass wall of the shower (presumably so you don't get wet when turning it on), it's cool to look at. 
3) Pretty tasty breakfasts, actually. A group of us bombarded the kitchen with a mass order this morning, and they cooked everything up reasonably fast and delivered it to our conference room. So, thumbs up for the croissant breakfast sando. 

And the lowlights:
1) I love Aveda products but what is up with the scent of the hand lotion? Sniff the bottle: bliss. Slather it on your body: smell like industrial cleaning product.
2) Although I like the look of the wooden floor (or faux wood) in the guest rooms, the person above me is up promptly at 6 a.m. every day stomping around in stilettos and it's pretty loud and clear. 
3) Drinks at the bar are expensive. $8 for a short vodka soda? $10 for a glass of wine? Are you sure we are in Scottsdale and not some ritzy bar in Vegas?

When all is said and done, I'd most likely stay at this hotel again when I'm in the area. Not bad. Not bad at all!",2

I need someone I feel I can trust, personality, knowledge, patience ""because I am picky"", reputation, standings with the ROC, and pricing. Drywall Perfection met all of my criteria. Bill is literally the best in the industry. He showed up on time and did the contracted work all while explaining in detail what he was doing and the steps that would be done. I really like that because I feel like I am bothering the contractor when I have to ask what are you doing now or what is that for etc. Drywall Perfection did an amazing job on my home and I love the outcome.

I have zero complaints about the service here when she's working.  (And the pizza is pretty darn good, too.)

Her team of young ladies, however, can sometimes be a little more detached.  It's great that they're helpful, but they are inconsistent with the ""Take 'N' Bake Club"" stamps (their rewards program for repeat purchases), and I have been shorted my proper stamps several times.  Mentioning this to the owner yielded no empathy, so points off for that.  I deserve my recognition for coming back and buying more pizza, thank you.

Their freshness is the key here, and what makes this chain of pizza purveyors different seems to be the quality of the ingredients.  Love the rich, robust sauce, the cheese (which is NOT greasy - yay!), and the fresh mushrooms.  Food for thought: Canned mushrooms are a punishment for those people willing to settle for crap pizza.  And we enjoy the ""de-lite"" selections of thin-crust pizzas when we need to dial back the carb intake.

As a side note, the other poster, Katherine, obviously didn't know about the Thunderbird or Union Hills locations (run by different owners), but Papa Murphy's' has been around for awhile now.

The same room that the neighbor's dogs ate the Christmas turkey which meant no turkey sandwiches! No turkey salad! No turkey gravy! Turkey Hash! Turkey a la King! Or gallons of turkey soup!

It is not, however, the same place that Ralphie tasted the Life Buoy soap instead of Palmolive, which had a nice, piquant after-dinner flavor - heady, but with just a touch of mellow smoothness.  And not the place where Ralphie had to dress as a deranged Easter Bunny.

Many scenes were filmed in this house which was restored to as close to movie condition as possible.  But most of the scenes were filmed on a sound stage.  But to be in the place where Christmas history was made is an amazing thing.  Don't expect the surrounding neighborhood to have the Christmas Story feel though.  But there is a nice gift shop across the street, and a local bar on the opposite corner.  The stories told by the tour guide were great, informative, and entertaining.

Overall, it was a great experience.  This should definitely be at the top of any Cleveland tourist's itinerary.  But then again, does Cleveland have tourists?",2

He doesn't really know what ""real"" Mexican food taste like and the people he hires are ""fly by night"" cooks.  I've experienced better quality Mexican food elsewhere because here it's not only very expensive, they used the same ingredients in their soups but change meats.  Burritos, combos, appetizers, soups, signature seafood, breakfast combos and burritos are small and too expensive.  It's no wonder nobody notices because most patrons are too drunk to see the price is too high.  Tacos are the only reasonably-priced menu items that are worth having.  There are better authentic Mexican restaurants nearby, such as, Herrera's, Valle de Luna, and original Garcia's on 35th Ave & south of McDowell Rd (with music).  The decorations they have is overwhelming and looks like they are hoarding them but most everyone is too drunk to notice.  They hired girls who dress a bit SLEAZY to get the patrons to buy more drinks.  What happen to this place, the owner got greedy and needs money.  What is with the 3-5 star ratings!  Are you blind!  Oh, yeah and they are now so s-l-o-w, it took them 35 minutes to make two lousy fish tacos.  Who they hired beginner cooks!  And they put up phony food photos, the portions are much smaller.

So, I tried Gypsie Bar at City Scape recently and I was pleasantly surprised. After hearing (and Yelp reading) a few reviews about it, I have formulated my very own take on the place:

GORGEOUS! The views from this bar are amazing. Especially on the Lucky Strikes Bowling side. I drank my Redbull Vodka happily as I stared into the vast array of buildings at night. The seats/bar/layout are very modern and comfortable. The decor is posh. The lighting was not too dark, but not too bright. It was perfect! 

FUN- There is a bar, a dance floor, lounge, arcade and a bowling alley. I went with a few friends and had a blast. I could dance it up for a while, then stroll on over the lounge and relax. I am surprised that so many are not raving about this place! 

ENVIRONMENT- I enjoyed the environment here. The people were very relaxed, not too dressed up but not too dressed down ect. There was not the ""I'm here to get laid"" vibe which was amazing! Everyone seemed very chill and there genuinely to enjoy a night out.

STAFF- The staff was very professional and sweet. They were not overly pretentious or rude which is rare for the nicer bars. The drinks were priced about the same price as they are on Mill Ave, however they are bigger and not served a plastic dixie cup (lol).

Overall, I LOVED this place! I will be definitely  heading there once again in the future. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!",2

14804,3,1550793600000,"Sushi San is the first sushi restaurant we've been to since moving out here from Connecticut and we were interested to see how it's done in a landlocked state. We decided to do the all you can eat option and the waitress informed us how it worked: you can't take home leftovers, it only encompassed certain rolls, good up to seven rolls each and we were good with all of that. 

The sushi wasn't anything to write home about but when the waitress asked us if we were finished and we said yes she kind of groaned at the sight of a few extra pieces of sushi left and then advised us that they charge $1 per piece that's left but she would give us a deal and only charge $5. What??? We had less than a roll left, rolls that are larger than I've ever seen except they're packed rather heavy on rice and short on fish. Some had about a fingernail's worth of actual non-rice mixture in it.  We didn't keep ordering food; we placed one order of six rolls and couldn't finish what we ordered. And we had to pay extra for not cleaning our plates.  Except the price per person encompassed seven rolls automatically (hence the limit) so despite the fact that the price included a charge for seven rolls per person and we only ordered 6 between the two of us and ate just over five we were still charged a penalty fee for not finishing our food.  I get it: waste not, want not but it usually helps to tell people UP FRONT that they charge extra for waste, not at the end when they're backed into the corner.  I should have smuggled the sushi to the bathroom in my purse and flushed it just based on principle.  I've never been charged arbitrary fees at a restaurant before.

On top of that the bill came and the all you can eat charge was $47.90 before taxes. So I asked about it and was told it's $2 or $3 more on the weekend. WHAT???  The signs they have out front all read $19.99 and the all you can eat option isn't priced on the menu, not to mention it's a vague amount more on the weekends, price to be charged at will.  There was absolutely no caveat mentioned for weekend pricing. What kind of restaurant has hidden fees?  So what we expected to be a $50 lunch turned into nearly $70 because my dumb self left only a 10% tip (I usually leave 20%) because the waitress was nice and attentive otherwise. 

On top of all of that we arrived home and I was immediately sick. What an awful, awful first Arizona sushi experience. Underhanded business practices, hidden fees and sushi that gets me sick? Never again at this place. Just an FYI I had the Murphy Roll, Apache Roll and Phoenix Roll. You've been warned.",2

So I'm a stickler for my carbs. I love the mancinis toast. If a diner doesn't have it, I don't go.  And the POTATOES guys.  They were cooked all the way through. And dark and crunchy on the outside.  No ketchup needed.

The place is pretty busy and finding a seat is rather difficult, so it's best to try and make reservations ahead of time if you're looking to bring a group in.  The decor is great and the place looks very modern.  I really liked the picture frames and retro style seating they have inside.

The food is pretty good and I usually get the Hawaii burger along with sweet potato fries or a poutine.  I must say the burger is your standard, and is similar to something you would get at South Street Burger or Five Guys.  The patty, seems to be previously frozen over freshly ground beef, but it tasted great regardless.  The sweet potato fries are pretty good, but I do find them to be a bit on the soggy side at times.  The poutine here is not bad as well, but compared to other poutines you can get around the city, it's sub par.

After reading some great Yelp reviews, I trekked out to Queen West and was greeted by a funky atmosphere and a super friendly, chill server. The menus were hip (like a record) and the content sounded delicious.

Fast forward 20 minutes of waiting for food (and being tempted by the mac-and-cheese at the table next to me in the meantime, and thus ordering one for myself), I finally met the Nice Lady (aka my wrap). The first bite was delicious but it got progressively worse as I couldnt find the other ingredients such as plantain, and all I could taste was the goat cheese. Bleh, Too much for me! My girlfriend got the Harlem sandwich with black forest ham, jerk chicken and havarti. I thought this was deeeelicious (minus the triple decker bread) but she found the spice of the jerk chicken too much. So, all you Weak Spices, stay away. Lastly, please don't be a fool like me and get suckered into the mac-and-cheese. You could probably make a better KD.

Shit really went downhill after this as the swarm of fruitflies over us became unbearable as we waited 20 or so minutes for our server. Such a sweet guy, but a really untimely smoke break.

Too bad. It all started so good. Maybe will try again some other time when fruitflies go extinct.

The price is fantastic and service outstanding. They seem to always give you something for free, which is such a nice touch and makes you feel like you're their favourite customer.

14963,3,1551139200000,"Yea, I feel dumb writing the 99th review... as if what I say about Black Dog will be more relevant or informative than the 98 before me... but might I say anyway:

I live in Los Angeles, I'm here for the summer.  Not that LA is known for bbq, but neither is East Central Illinois, so I'll continue.  STILL, I eat at a barbecue/beer joint every week, more than once a week in Los Angeles and BLACK DOG makes me feel embarrassed that I spend $20 on a pulled pork sandwich, a beer and a tip at Blues BBQ in West Hollywood.  6.95 for a burnt tips or ends or whatever sandwich AND a side [I had potato salad and dipped those spuds into every one of my sauce flight sauces].    And like $4 for a glass of what our AWESOME, nice-sporty-but-down-to-earth-witty waiter    waiter called a REALLY nice PBR.  

I got there at 11:00 and watched the place fill up to the point where we had to use a back exit to get a baby in a stroller and a 4-year-old out of the restaurant.  But they HAD A BACK DOOR and they let us use it which made us feel cool and made them look cool for being accommodating.  It probably wasn't even a secret door, but we felt grateful all the same.  

The vegetarian 4-year-old happily ate an awesome looking provolone grilled sandwich, so Imma just put that out there in case your vegetarian self gets pulled along to Black Dog.  

Nice-sporty-but-down-to-earth-witty waiter sampled us beer, gave me an extra sauce when I decided which one from my flight was the best [I liked Georgia Peach] and was really attentive despite a full-house at 11:30 a.m. 

I got out of there full-to-the-brim and more satisfied than I've been in awhile [good bbq paired with beer is a wonderful lover] for less than $12 [excluding the big ol' tip he deserved].  Why is CU so great??  

If someone wanted the short version of what my BBQ at Black Dog experience was, I would yell:  ""LEGIT AS HELL."" and hope that summed up the flava', waiter and atmosphere.",2

Parking is next to a bank, and you have to pay for it so make sure you bring some cash!

Now for the food! My friend and I ordered the Devil's Eggs, Calamari, Tomato Bisque, and the Fried Egg BLT!! Every thing we ordered was great!! I didn't care that much for the Devil's Eggs though because I felt that the mustard was a bit too overpowering.  The Calamari was crunchy and delicious! They drizzled a sweet and savory sauce over the calamari which was nice but by the time our meals came out, the calamari started to become soggy.  The tomato bisque was so delicious!!! The flavor is differently rich with a creamy texture.  I ordered the soup just so I could dip my sandwich in there. which was the best decision I made during this experience!  The sandwich had a lot of flavor! The eggs were definitely seasoned perfectly so when it drizzled out of the sandwich it tasted divine!  They were not shy with the bacon, in which they made sure there was a crunch with every bite.  The lettuce and tomato were so fresh and crispy which helped put this sandwich together!  And of course how can I forget the fries! The fries were tossed in Parmesan!! The fries were perfectly seasoned that even when I was full, it was hard to stop eating it because they were that good!

They carry several luxury pieces, like Herve Leger, to middle brands like Alice + Olivia and Theory, to very reasonably-priced items made in Europe of names I've never heard of.  The availability of designer denim is great: Rag and Bone, Mother, Habitat, etc.  Scoop NYC also has a terrific sales selection: on Monday, they had 50% off the SALE price, which I hoarded several clothes in my size to try on.  Strangely enough, I didn't find any good sale clothes and actually left the store with a pair of full-priced Mother jeans.  Oh well!

The guy who assisted me, Jason, was awesome.  He had the right amount of attentiveness I look for: not overboard that you'd find at neighboring Carolina Herrera, but way more than The Gap or similar.  Not that he couldn't help with personal shopping, but I just didn't request it.  Jason installed me in a spacious dressing room with a heavy curtain and decent lighting.  He checked up on me periodically and was just overall laid back and not pushy, but appeared to be an efficient worker as he made the rounds greeting shoppers and re-organizing the displays and working the registers.  He found me stuff in other sizes and showed me everything that was on sale, along with some stuff hidden away in hard-to-see displays.

The store is a good size with a large selection, of which I was pleased with the overall style of the stuff they sell.  And the shopping bag he gave me is super sturdy and can definitely be re-used!

15038,2,1549670400000,"The biggest disappointment about Fairfield Inn & Suites is the bed...I had hip and back pain all night long as I tossed and turned on that sucky mattress. 

The hotel had huge movable air conditioning units throughout the lobby and breakfast area. It's too bad we didn't have them in the room because the A/C absolutely could not keep up with the Charlotte heat. The room was sweltering for our entire stay, and the mattress seemed to retain heat so it was even worse at night.

There are only two elevators for the entire building, and in the last day of our stay one went down. As a result, people had to line up to use the elevator. At one point we waited ten minutes to get back up to our room.

Like most Uptown hotels in Charlotte, Fairfield Inn & Suites does not offer any free parking. There is a parking garage that charges $10 for daily parking (no overnight) and $15 for overnight parking. The entryway of the hotel is pretty much a clusterfudge...there is no place to park without going into the paid parking garage, and if you leave your car to go check-in you are blocking cars from entering the garage. It is not a convenient set-up.

The breakfast offerings are extensive: oatmeal, waffles, fruit (even fresh pears!), a hot bar with a preparation of eggs and a breakfast meat, muffins and bagels, etc. There is also an on-site restaurant so you can order room-service.

Fairfield Inn & Suites was more than adequate, but the parking, elevator, and A/C issues made things inconvenient. Add a crappy bed to the mix, and you get a 3 star review (really a 2.5 but I usually round up). Forgettable.",2

So many security measures in place, including a security guard sitting in a lawn chair with his back towards the hotel, which turns out is the security guard from the hard rock, across the street. The hallway looks extra ghetto. We come into the room, looks pretty nice. Until you look up and see that the can light cover is coming off and there is no bulb in it. I go to shower and the ""rain"" shower head was more like a drip shower head. I let the water run for 5 min before trying to get in. Zero hot water. Turn on the sink to try to get some hot water and it was scolding hot, still cold water in the shower. Thankfully we had a Jacuzzi bathtub.. minus the Jacuzzi part, those were sealed up with I'm not sure what. The water in the tub got scolding hot also so we were able to kind of bathe. I was not about to sit in that rub, not sure if I would catch something. Took at least 15 min to fill up the tub enough to kind of bathe. Maybe that is why there are mirrors on 2 of the walls at the tub, so you can see if you got all the soap off your back. Every outlet was horrible, nothing would stay plugged in. Literally every outlet. The tv was decent until you go to change the channel and you had to put the remote behind the tv because that is where the cable box is. There was no a.c. or heater except for the tiny portable, tabletop heater that didn't hear up the entire room. The closet door was not on the track. There were ants in the bathtub. Washing my face was a challenge considering the sink water was scolding and zero cold water coming out. The lighting was horrible in the room and couldn't open the curtains because you could see straight in from the pool.

I also asked if it was an issue to come to the east valley and he stated no problem at all, they were state wide. So Monday comes. I didn't get a phone call, but I did get an email.

Via email I set up an appointment for Saturday from 11 to 1 for an estimate. Cleared my whole schedule to be home during that time frame, and they never show! Not even a phone call or an email. I tried calling the number provided with no response. I'm extremely displeased and frustrated that not only I wasted a day off when there are things I could have been doing. But I could have had someone come out during that time who was actually accountable for the appointments they make. If this company has done great work for you, lucky you, but I will not be going with someone who can't even show up to an estimate appointment or at least not even let me know they're not coming.

The family and I drove a couple hours out of our way to make it to the appointment.  When I walked through the doors, about thirty minutes early, the receptionist informed me that the doctor had inexplicably left for the day.  The explanation that she provided was that I was ""his last appointment for the afternoon.""  As though it is a custom of his to desert before his last afternoon appointment.  Perhaps this is a Dr. Meyerowitz tradition? I was definitely pretty angry to hear that news.  But, I have waited 2 weeks to cool off before submitting an angry review.  Turns out, even two weeks later, I still find it completely rude to skip out on an appointment leaving a receptionist behind to try to explain away your laziness and cowardice.  Avoid at all costs.

Personally, I thought it was all delicious. My boyfriend on the other hand said it was pretty mediocre, so I would trust his opinion over mine, but he still enjoyed it. 

The part that kind of ruined the experience was the cart service. Most of the things that we wanted to order never came around. As we were leaving we noticed a kind of buffet style, serve yourself station at the back end (? Still unsure) so the way they do things was a little confusing and we left not entirely satisfied, as we would have ate much more had we known it was available.

15100,1,1550448000000,"First off I do like the atmosphere of the restaurant. I've been to this Garcia's several times this year.   I'm not one of those guys that likes to be inside a loud obnoxious, super busy setting while I'm eating or digesting.   It's quiet there and somewhat peaceful.  Because its not jam packed with people.  That being said, I understand why it's not so popular.   

   The waiting staff can sometimes be very rude and annoying. Somewhat territorial.... They sometimes sit by the front near the host and talk and gossip and cackle.     There is one waitress there specifically that is super rude.    I got a bad diet coke one time and asked for a diet dr pepper. She told me I would be charged for another drink!     
 I usually order the lite spinach quesadilla with extra grilled vegetables instead of charro beans.   Its delicious and a great non greasy meal.      I like to fill up on beans and chips anyway.  And have some food leftover to take home.
   My last few visits I noticed my chicken in my quesadilla was getting very light and that concerned me.   I complained and nothing was done about it... So..    Now I just order extra chicken . Which I'm charged and extra three dollars ...  But whatever .   

 The waiting staff makes it so difficult to modify your order.  They give you this look and pretend like they can't modify anything.      Like it's impossible.    They treat there customers kinda like spoiled babies.   They charge enough , the customer should get exactly what they want.      
 Besides the attitude from the waiting staff, I'll admit they do a great job refilling drinks, chips, bean dips, salsa .   But you have to be direct with them and almost demanding.....   once you demand what you want they snap out of their funk and service becomes amazing.  I know this isn't really what most people think is acceptable.  I'm just being honest with how my experiences go with them.     I like the atmosphere  and most the time the staff really does take notice to refilling .      

one time they seated my fiancee and I and the people next to us were laughing and using foul language and being very loud (drunk). Smoking vapor pipes ugh.   I kindly asked the ""manager"" if we could move to opposite side.  It was dead and empty.   He got agitated and said ""but they're almost finished!"".   I told him I didn't care and they moved us to a quieter spot.  I told him sorry for putting you out..    the tall manager with a goatie is kinda a tool.     

 I was torn whether to give this a 3 or a 4 star. 

I still like going here.  I just feel like the management is mediocre and is immature.    If you want the red carpet rolled out for you when you dine, don't go here.    If you want a nice chill restaurant with ok food and yummy all you can eat chips and hot bean dip and salsa.",2

I went a couple of friends of mine on a boys night out. Good music, the crowd was a good mixture of girls and guys enjoying the music and the show. Note: you can still do there just for the music and not indulge in viewing some absolutely jaw dropping stripping pole acrobatics; but you probably will and your jaw will drop.

Only issue I have with this place is, there is not enough seating area or big of a dance floor. You can't fully appreciate the view or lose yourself to the music.",2

15190,3,1551052800000,"Like many Americans, I'm a big fan of a well-constructed sandwich. There are some key things to a great sandwich - flavor harmony, texture variety, uniform layering, and good ingredients. Let's start with flavor harmony. Depending on the ingredients that you decide to add to your sandwich (I usually get all of them), the sandwiches have a good mixture of sweet, spicy, savory, and acidity. This is a very good thing as it makes each bite interesting, complex, and rich in flavor. Another good thing - the ingredients have a variety of textures with a combination of raw, crispy, and soft. Third, the sandwich makers at Saigon do a pretty good job of layering the ingredients. In most bites of the sandwich, I am able to find all ingredients present. The final point is where Saigon falls slightly short of expectations. While the bread and supplementary ingredients are all fresh, the meat seems to be of a lower quality. However, this does not deter too much from the sandwich. For the price and speed, you get a lot more than the $5 that you paid. Overall, this is a great spot on campus for a quick and flavor-packed meal.",2

We also ordered a custom sushi eel roll. The roll was 10 pieces and was very good. This place is a convenient alternative if you are in the mood for noodles. You may even want to take their sumo challenge of eating one of their giant noodle bowls.

- Very supportive teachers
- Yoga sequence is suitable for everyone
- Inclusive = everyone is welcomed here!

You can order your sandwich ""skinny"" (less bread) or as a salad. I normally don't like chips but I do like their house made salt and pepper chips. 

Ingredients are fresh and you can have them make it with exactly the ingredients you want in it. One star down because there's a couple items that typically come with onion. I write in big letters NO ONION and tell the cashier. They only see it about 1/2 the time. Very frustrating when ordering to go and don't see until I don't see it until I get home. Also because typically chicken is my favorite meat. Theirs is Ho-hum. Not sure why but it seems to lack flavor.",3

The menu is designed both in serving size and seasonings for the older crowd in Sun City.  I had a 2 egg Western omelet with ham, bell peppers and onions with toast.  The total with coffee, tax and tip came in around  $10.  There are daily specials even less.

Service was good.  Order, food and coffee were all taken care of quickly.  I gathered by the way the lone waitress interacted with the customers many of them were regulars.

This is a neighborhood type of restaurant open for breakfast and lunch only.  The hours are currently 7AM to 2 PM and listed on the window as summer hours.  These are hours normally associated with some place in a business district and I wonder if the winter hours include Saturday and or Sunday as Sun City is noted for a large percentage of the population to leave during the summer.  Some modifications have been made to the furniture to make it easier to clean; the tables have been covered over with Naugahyde  and the conference room style cloth chairs have been covered in a heavy clear plastic.

15271,1,1551312000000,"Eating Japanese-style hot pot at Kintaro can be an interesting culinary experience, even if the quality of the food is just okay. The restaurant is family-friendly, located out in a stripmall and filled with massive tables and booths.   But the garrish decor is not the only reason why you'll note this is not a fancy restaurant.  Nor is the troth of peanuts at the entrance. 
The booth seats are deeply broken in, the chopsticks are cheap and will splinter, and the electric burner in the table won't heat evenly.  

Nevertheless, we enjoyed adding a dozen tasty meats, noodles, and veggies to our pot.  Be adventurous and try out some of the less familiar items.  Just be careful, it IS possible to create an unappetizing mess.  Be sure keep an eye on you additions as they take only a minute to cook through, especially the meats.   Remember that the sauces are for dipping. 

I would order these again: balls of fish (caution: they get very hot), taro, cabbage, black mushroom, lotus root, chinese lettuce, bean sprouts, tong hao cai, tofu skin, turnip, enoki, watercress, and wood ear.  

I would definitely not reorder bamboo shoot (its from a can), the corn cob (popular, but too starchy), frozen tofu, or whole shrimp (not worth the mess of shelling them at the table).  Many of the items come to you frozen: clumps of noodles, seafood, and some vegetables with ice on them. It would be nice if they even went to the trouble to defrost them first!  Anywhere else it would be scandalous to serve frozen food where it was meant to be fresh, but at Kintaro that seems to be the norm.  

Lastly, the soup-base was very disappointing.  The six options are made of the same powdered mix, which is also available in crystallized form at the sauce station. 

I recommend eating here at least once, just be sure to keep your expectations reasonably low.",2

Correspondence with the Pair team is quick (receive a response typically within 30min to an hour with the support team - sometimes even less) and usually within one email everything I need is addressed entirely. Their staff are also friendly, professional and knowledgeable which is helpful when you have to talk with them (have dealt with other hosting companies and the customer service was lacking). 

Out of the time I have been with Pair, I have only had my website down ""ONCE"" due to server problems in March 2012 (which they helped me with by transferring me to a new server).

We were specifically looking for a ribeye, and they did not have any, so we left. We were looking for a place within walking distance of Hilton Garden Inn Downtown.
We did not find a good option for ribeye, but since Nicolette had mentioned a New York strip special they had, we decided to go back. 
(I quickly made a reservation through my phone and we were seated right away, earlier we had been told the main dining area was quite busy and we were encouraged to sit at the bar, but with the reservation we were able to sit at the dining area... In a very weird corner and they were not even busy)
As it turns out Nicolette was our server and she took really good care of us, from the brief interaction earlier we already knew she was going to be great.
Hubby had a Long Island Iced Tea that was served in a super skinny tall glass with of course big ice cubes, so the portion was very small (not so happy about that detail), but then our dinner arrived and it was amazing. Hubby had the flat iron steak and he enjoyed it very much, I had the New York strip special and it was delicious. I had asked Nicolette to request a very fatty cut and it was just what I was needing (I am doing pseudo keto diet and had a marathon to run the next day).
My steak came with loaded mashed potatoes (hubby enjoyed those), green beans, and some sort of squash, I asked for extra butter for the green beans and everything was delicious. 
Hubby had the pineapple upside down for dessert, it came with pineapple gelato, I had a microscopic sample of each and it was good, the gelato was very tasty without being overly sweet.

I won't pay that much after experiencing substandard service. We switched to Linq for an extended stay at $88 and we wished we chose the Linq hotel for the weekend. The fridge was available without additional costs to store our drinks and food, and the bathroom was clean and updated so the sight of bad caulking was nonexistent. The elevators at Linq worked...all of them,  which is a huge plus.

I called back and scheduled my truck to be diagnosed Monday at 2pm. (As I'm told it is by appointment time only). I Rearranged my schedule to make sure I could drop my truck off to find out what repairs were needed. Arriving today (Monday) for my 2pm appointment I am told I am not on the schedule and that it will be a 2-3 hr wait just to have it diagnosed!!!

Interior décor is modern rustic, and the employees are genuine and friendly. The bowl-building beauties behind the counter are happy to walk you through the menu or make a suggestion based on what you like. My pick is the original acai bowl, which is topped with bananas, strawberries, and honey. Delicious!

Only suggestion is to implement a loyalty card deal- pricing is pretty fair for the value, but I can see myself coming back pretty regularly and would love to be able to earn a discount of some sort.

EDIT: They now have a punch card! Five bowls gets you a freebie. Cards are at the register, you have to ask for them to sign. Now if they can just upgrade to the sturdier cardboard containers and clear bubble lids (like at a froyo joint), so that you don't have to cram your fruit toppings to take the order to go!

EDIT #2: They now offer poke bowls exclusively at this location. I was really disappointed with mine. For the price, it was less than half of what I receive elsewhere and lacked flavor.

My college town of Orono, Maine had a handful of restaurants that he a special place in my heart. They were dark, small, not so clean and If I went back and ate the food now... I'm not sure it would be as good as I remember. 
I ordered the coffee, pancakes and a side of potatoes. 
Weirdly the potatoes were amazing... I have since thought of ordering just the potatoes to go.
The pancake was a disaster, the inside consistency was paste. It was browned and golden looking on the outside but very dense and had an awful texture. 
I will say the waitress was a saint. 
I have worked in diners in a previous life and would dread the complains that would trickle in. 
She took my pancake away/ took it off the bill as I enjoyed my mountain of delicious potatoes and before I left she brought me a cinnamon bun to take with me at no charge. She assured me I would love it. ""Warm it up in the microwave for 20 seconds"" she said.

It didn't looked too packed when we went in, and we were immediately asked if we wanted drinks? Yes please! We knew what we wanted so we ordered when the drinks came.  AND THEN: THE BREAD ARRIVED.

I can not get enough of the bread.  It is just the right amount of crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  A little delight that you twist off the rest of the roll, spread butter on and stuff in your f****** mouth.  We finished the bread AND THEN: MORE BREAD.  No, seriously...our food was taking a long time so they gave us more bread and we ordered another round of drinks.  We finished that one as well, but the appetizers still weren't ready.

Just when I was about to flag down a waiter, the manager came to our table and gave us his sincerest apologies.  They were behind on their orders and had an unexpected something with the escargot, but we need not worry because the appetizers were on the house. Ummm ok! My beautiful date and I were locked in conversation anyway, so we could wait a few more minutes for free appetizers.  The escargot and tuna tartare were delicious!  I would have ordered more, but I didn't want to wait, and besides my Steak Frites should be out soon right? Wrong, we had to wait a little while longer.  When it finally arrived, I devoured every last bite.  My only complaint is that I ordered the fries with truffles for $10 dollars more, and the fries were nothing special.  I packed them up to go for later, and asked for MORE BREAD!  They gladly gave us more.  

The staff, btw, was excellent.  They were all attentive and cordial.  Even though the food took a while to arrive I have to say the customer service is great.  I'll be back Bouchon, if nothing else, for MORE BREAD!",3
15393,3,1549238400000,"Great selection. They had the Bourbon I'd sought after for so long, Pappy Van Winkle. Glad I got to try it, but they were a bit full of themselves on the prices. I had the 20 year and it was like drinking gold (literally)! Needless to say if you're looking to try Pappy and money isn't an issue try it. But it can be found elsewhere for a significantly lower price. Other than the price point the bourbon was the best thing that's hit my palate in my short 21 years of life and our bartenders knew their bourbon so I had the pleasure of having a good 45 minute conversation about bourbon. They were also kind enough to give my dad and I several free drinks for ordering 2 Pappy 20's. Good thing I didn't pay for it though, thanks dad!",2
15395,1,1549584000000,"The flavours all look amazing. But if you're like me and want to try a few flavours before deciding, you only get to choose two max. I did prefer the taste of the dolce de leche versus the toronne.  I loved the caramel flavour from the dolce. The toronne is an almond gelato with nougat that tasted ok. But the price was too rich for my blood. It was $5.25 for one scoop. You're better off getting two scoops for $6.25. And the scoops are very small for that price.",2

15437,1,1549756800000,"Craving something super healthy, I decided to pop into this place as I was in the area on my way to the leafs game (Go Leafs Go!!). 

Walked into a confusing looking restaurant. 

There was a fridge storing food in the middle of the restaurant (ok - a little to the left). Take away boxes and salad bowls hovered above our heads. 

Seating is perimeter bar style and a bit awkward if you ask me. The overall design of this place isn't functional. A better layout would make the ambience less institutional. But there may be structural limitations (not sure). 

On the the important stuff...the Food:

Ordered the Frenchy Flock salad. A bunch of mixed greens, lentils, roasted cauliflower, yummy onions, an egg and a whole bunch of other goodies. A lot of places cheap out by stuffing salads with a lot of lettuce and missing the key ingredients listed on the menu.  Not this place! There's definitely a well balanced and generous mix of ingredients. 

Also ordered the Coup Soup. A butternut-squashy, coconut soup with corn and hints of lemon grass. The flavours were good and thankfully the soup was not salty at all. My only recommendation is that the soup be served at a slightly higher temperature. 

Great first experience and I'll be back to try the chicken (on a cheat day!).",2

Paul came out and did the treatment as advertised.

We shared the chic caprese sandwich, he had a black coffee (yummy) & I had a jasmine ice tea. Everything was great super chill spot I was shocked to see how they've expanded and now have a full kitchen. Years ago this was only a coffee shop and it's turned into a cafe. I'm so glad I live close by now! My only complaint is I wish they can add soup to their menu. I was craving a small bite with soup but they have everything else BUT that.

Not a big fan of having to pays extra for some chip crumbs but whatever it's worth it. Soup is 5 stars. They know we as consumers will pay extra so I can't blame them. Also I was not a big fan of their choices for sandwiches. I figured most sandwich places have something close to a roast beef sandwich, but not here. That is the only reason I take off one star. I would have bought the soup and sandwich if they had that option. Overall this place is great. Many options for most people...just not if you like roast beef.",3

For those that are in a hurry, all you have to do is say that upfront. There's nothing quick about going to a barber, they like to chat with you and those waiting, it's part of the experience. I am Latin, but as I waited those excruciating 15 min, I was completely engaged with the conversation at hand...and the guy driving the conversation was white (gasp).

Ambiance in Jardin is lovely, light, and bright with white decor and indoor and outdoor seating available.  The room was uncomfortably warm due to the door to the outside seating being located within 30 feet of where we were sitting.  The highlight for me was the vegan entree of Mushroom Dashi, a beautiful bowl of baked tofu in broth with  baby bokchoy, mushrooms, and rice noodles.    It was delicious and creative.  Unfortunately, the non-vegan entrees left a lot to be desired.  The pork chop was a large portion and a good cut, but it lacked flavor and the sauce was uninspiring.  The salmon was dry and inedible.  The waiter removed it from the table without even asking why the diner left almost the entire fish on the plate.  The most disappointing aspect of the dinner was the service.  From waiter to the waiter's assistants, the staff cultivated a stiff and pretentious demeanor that was off putting.

15502,1,1550707200000,"Disclaimer: I lived in DC for a while so my standards for cupcakes are pretty high.

The ""cakeshake"" is disgusting. The cake doesn't mix well with ice cream. It was like slurping up a cupcake via straw. And my partner agrees with me.

The cupcakes themselves are mediocre in flavor. Similar size to those sold at Crumbs.

I've been here three times and this last time the service girl refused to serve me for whatever reason. Mind you, I was standing in front of the register the whole time so she could see me since the cupcake stand is tall and I'm short. She served 6 people who were behind me and had been still deciding on what they wanted while I was ready to be served.

I can take the mediocrity but the disrespect was unnecessary.  

Also when she finally rang me up, she didn't listen to what I ordered and rang me up for one cupcake, when I asked for two. Then, instead of putting them in a double container she leaves them in the singles container, which makes for a bulky bag. She didn't ask me if I wanted a bag (asked everyone else though) so I had to request one. There was cupcake icing all over the bag to the point it was getting on my work clothes.

She seemed like she was new because she didn't know how to ring up a gift certificate, but her customer service skills are terrible.  

I would only recommend this place because I'm new to the city and I don't know about any other cupcake shops. But I imagine there are others around. However, I won't be coming back due to poor service. At least the cupcakes are decent.",3

Now for everyone complaining about the first initial visit and them REQUESTING that ALL  decision making parties are present at the initial presentation.... all I have to say is GET OVER IT. Just like when you buy a car, you have everyone involved because it's a purchase you have to agree upon.  You don't just look at the lot and buy the first car you see... you get all of the information about the car, the features, finance options, etc.  This is a business. Their time is valuable, just like yours and they are trying to avoid situations where ppl waste their time by saying,  ""Well.... I need to talk to my husband/wife/ (etc) first."" Yes, Windows are pricy. There is a lot of information they want everyone to hear and see for themselves to avoid confusion and to be able to make an informed decision *together*.  They have a whole menu of options and they want all parties present because they actually SHOW you the difference in the types of glass and how they block out heat, the different framing and how it is constructed.  It really DOES make a difference. They don't want to spend time explaining all of this just to get the ""I have to talk to the boss"" B.S. & then never call back because of the price. Remember... This is an investment in your home.  Its not picking out nail color at the salon. They take the time to explain and SHOW you why their product is the best. For as much as windows cost you'd think ppl would want the INFORMATION about WHAT they are looking to buy and why. Take the time to make am INFORMED decision about your home ppl!

It was perfectly sauced, tasting a bit sweet which balanced out with the white rice. Portion size of the chicken and rice itself was very generous. I felt so full that I went back to my friend's apartment and took an hour nap due to food coma. You know somethings good if you had to rest and recover for that long.

We were seated right away and were given menus but it took about 10 minutes or so for the gentlemen there to take our order. 

The restaurant is nicely decorated compared to the Vietnamese restaurants I've frequented in Central Phoenix and the vibe seems more relaxed where the employees are nice. The prices are a little on the higher side - not higher based on the average plate price for lunch (around $10), but higher compared to most Vietnamese restaurants. 

There were lunch specials highlighted on the menu, but I decided to order off of the regular menu and got the seafood pho which included scallops, shrimp and mussels. Hubby ordered Vietnamese coffee and the Vietnamese sandwich. I enjoyed the pho and hubby enjoyed the sandwich, but the coffee was really strong and it wasn't as sweet as I would like.

15629,3,1550448000000,"Overall this was a very pleasant stay. Nothing outrageously luxurious or horribly bad. We stayed here for 2 nights for a wedding of a family member. 

Pros: 
- When we first checked in it was about 12 at night. The desk attendant was very friendly and accommodating, a GREAT 1st impression
- We wanted a quiet place, away from the strip to go home to and this was perfect. The giant king bed was comfortable and had lots of pillows. The layout of the room was different and refreshing.
- Breakfast was above average than your usual continental breakfast you get. They provided orange juice, coffee, milk, lemon water, fresh waffles, bagels, cereal and yogurt  
- Free WIFI
- Did I mention that they have coffee 24/6 
- About 4 minutes away there is a 24 hour supermarket...

Cons: (just a few)
- The door to our bathroom did not shut properly (a broken spring that can be easily fixed)
- We were in a room near the end of the hall. The door to the stairs slammed when it was shut. Luckily only a few times. 

Overall a very pleasant stay! If all La Quintas are like this I will be back  :)",3
15631,2,1551052800000,"I just returned from a three day stay at the Flamingo.  Overall the price and central location in the middle of the strip makes it a great value for the money.   A few observations on my most recent trip.  

1. Pool - The main reason I stayed here is because of the pool party and once again it did not disappoint.  The pool is beautiful.  Get there early in the summer months because the chairs fill up quick.  Depending on the time of year you'll get a slightly different crowd.  Way more college students in the June-August time period.  There always seems to be a good mix of people here and the people watching is great.  The staff working the pool area has been great every time I've been there. 

2. Casino - its an old casino.  Other than the pink decorative cues here and there it pretty much looks like any of the other low-mid budget resorts on the strip.   It tends to be an older clientele.  If you want to go somewhere that feels less like a retirement home you're a short walk to nearly all of the newer casinos on the strip.

3. The food here sucks.  By far the worst is the Center Cut Steakhouse.  Pricing is on par with Mortons or Capital Grill.  I got the ""Center Cut"" NY Strip.  The cut of meat I got was extremely tough and overcooked.  The person I was with got a Filet and it was similarly bad.  For a ~$45 steak I'd expect a lot better.  Sides are ala carte.  We got a potato and vegetable based side and both seemed to be seasoned with a big pile of salt and their homemade popovers were so undercooked it was like eating bread dough.   

Carlos and Charlies wasn't good either.  The food court is mediocre even by foodcourt standards.   The buffet was ok but nothing spectacular.  I haven't eaten at the other restaurants in the resort but given they're track record at the ones I have eaten at I'd go somewhere else.  If you must eat here, get the buffet.

4. Rooms and Decor - The decor in the casino is fine for an old hotel.  The decor in the actual room areas is kind of junky especially in the tower that runs parallel to Imperial Palace.  The carpet in the hallway was filthy and the carpentry work on the hallway walls was pretty shoddy.  Empty pizza boxes and room service trays sat in the hall way for most of the day.  In the room, there is cheap faux hard wood floors and two of my electrical outlets did not work.  The suites look like they haven't been updated since the mid 80s. 

Overall despite the many negative comments, I'd still stay here again. The pool party makes it worth while (this effect is negated in the Nov-April months).  Plus for the price and the location so close to most of the newer resorts you can't beat it.  Afterall, you probably won't spend much time in your room anyway.",2

The patty was pretty thick and cooked to medium rare. The onion rings I had were cooked perfectly, but the thing that will bring me back to this place are the chicken wings. Wings had a very sweet and tangy flavored sauce which I assume is the same og sauce they glazed the beef patty with. The burger itself I would give 3 stars but the wings earned the place another star!! Props from Cali!",2

The facility is clean and cheerful, with perfectly sized cubbies for shoes and purses. Donna greeted us at the door at made us feel welcome. Being newbies to TRX, she patiently explained the bands and what fitness benefits they can provide using your own body weight. The hourlong class was filled with Donna giving instructions and demonstrating the yoga techniques using TRX to upbeat music. She walked around the room and gave feedback to everyone, well mostly me, on their proper form and positioning. I was glad she helped me get the workout I came for, but disappointed that I'm not as graceful and coordinated as I like to think I am. 

I definitely got what I bargained for with the workout. I was so sore for days after working muscles that I didn't even know I had.

Here's what happened: My friends asked the waiter what he recommended for pasta and he suggested some kind of pasta BOLOGnese, and they ordered that.  When he took my order, I said ""I'll also have the pasta BOLOGnese,"" I was craving pasta.  When our orders came, they got pasta dishes and I received something piled deep under green leaves.  Turns out he heard me order the Veal MILANese, and then he gave me attitude about it. Dude, you just recommended some bolognese stuff to half our table and I said I would also have that!  He did offer to replace the item, but I was too hungry to wait and didn't want my friends to wait for me to finish whenever I did get my replacement order, plus I already angered the guy that brings the food, so I wasn't going to risk it.  Conveniently for them, the Veal Milanese was one of the pricier entrees...

It should be a sign to you how good the food is that I gave them 4-stars despite my little kerfuffle.  Seriously, it was not easy trying to maintain a pissed-off front while eating that rather great Veal Milanese.  A lot has been mentioned about the quality of the bread, yes, it is also really good.

The pizzas aren't necessarily great, they're alright, we shared one as an appetizer, didn't really leave me craving more, I didn't even try to fight for the last slice.  Also, and this is very European of them, they serve the tiny-bottled sodas, meaning refills aren't free, and that is annoying.

The girl at the counter was not very interested in customer service and did not seem to know much of anything about the company. She did not even know how to process the storage locker we wanted to empty and return the key to...
The truck its self was very clean and ran fine. 
When we picked up the truck we were told to return it with 1/2 tank of gas or there would be a $30 fee plus $5 per gallon. So we knew we would be stopping to fill up on the way back.
The gas gage was acting kinda funny during the trip but we didn't think much of it. 
When it was time to return the truck the gas gage said we had 3/4 of a tank remaining, so we just went straight back to the lot.
The worker looks through the truck and everything seems fine. My guy decided to look at the paperwork before paying and it was marked that the truck only had 1/4 of a tank. We were shocked and pointed out the mistake since the fees would have been so high. 
It was then we were told the gas gage was backwards...
What!?
The staff acted like it was no big deal and even tried to blame the truck manufacture. I have never seen a new vehicle with a backwards gas gage in my life. These scam artists had it flipped in order to trick people tired from moving all day into paying their ridiculous fees.

Even the manager of the salon treats the customers and works, she doesn't just walk around and do nothing.

One other thing that I can appreciate is they keep track of your visits and reward you for spending. Every certain amount of points(per dollar) that you spend you are treated to a free service. It is all kept track of electronically too.. so no more business card size paper with hole punches that you lose! How can you beat that??!!
 I  did noticed most of the bad reviews have one thing in common, a coupon of some sort.

15828,3,1550534400000,"Fellow Meatyelpers,

I cannot emphasize this 5 star rating enough.  I would deduct one star for the lack of actual Brazilian personnel working at this location, but the food was just so good that I forgot about that mundane detail.  

I had seen this restaurant before a couple of years ago and since the opportunity arose once again to try it out, I completely grabbed onto it and went for the meat ride (no homo).

The location is marvelous, situated in the middle of Tryon's main drag in uptown Charlotte.  When compared to the other Brazilian Rodizio style steakhouses which I have eaten at, this one outshines both in its location (see my reviews for the other two in Orlando, FL).  It is tucked into the lobby of one of the many beautifully designed highrises in Charlotte.  I presume rent must cost an arm and a leg, luckily they use cows for that at Chima.

Upon entering I was immediately taken back by the superb decor of the place.  A large waiting area that is very modern with some light fixtures akin to a 1970s attempt at a futuristic home.  The lobby is slightly elevated which gives you, the guest, a grandiose view of all the meat comas going on in that very special ward known as the dining area.  Smack dab in the middle of the dining area is a very respectable salad bar that in my opinion fell a tad short of expectations.  The upstairs area provides space for a private dining rom and a very nicely set up lounge complete with an awesome bar.  All this can be reached via a mansion style round stairwell or by using the elevator located at the lobby.  This is good for those who cannot walk once done with their meals (refer to my photos for the aforementioned description).

Expect to be treated extra special like a baby in an incubator.  These meat surgeons will take care of all your needs until you are ready to go home to mom.  The servers are extremely courteous and attentive.  You can request any specialty meats that you may have missed out on during your meal and it will be promptly brought to your table.

You will receive many sides to accompany your meal as well as the salad bar option.  However, you can opt out of the meats and go for a cheaper all you can eat swordfish/salmon and salad bar dinner which will you run you about half of the meat dinner price.  

The sides consist of Mashed Potatoes, Fried Bananas, Parmesan Cheese Bread, Polenta, Beef Croquettes and a nice spread to put on your bread (see my photos).  Please do not focus on these as you want to have as much room as possible to enjoy the overwhelming amount of meats being served by your friendly neighborhood gaucho.

The salad bar has plenty of items to choose from along with some brazilian staples such as the Feijoada.  I won't focus on this since it's a salad bar in a STEAKHOUSE.  Vegetarians, hit your browser's back button now.

The meats that stood out for me were as follows:  The Picanha, Leg of Lamb, Lamb Chops, Bacon Wrapped Chicken and Parmesan Pork, Filet Mignon and Ribs.  Although, all were delicious including the Picanha which is Brazil's prime cut, I have yet to taste better Lamb in my life.  The seasoning on both the Leg of Lamb and Lamb Chops was out of this world delicious (see my photos).  I highly recommend it.  It's so magical, I can't even put it into words.  Think of the best tasting cut of meat you have ever had and multiply that by the highest scientific notation ever and that won't equal the amount of excitement my taste buds had when this work of culinary art touched them.  Pure meat bliss.

I think I have said enough to convince you to at least try their Lamb!  Go here because this place is fantastic.  If you don't have a good dining experience e-mail me personally and I'll paypal you the amount of your dinner in full.  This is my personal guarantee of how much you'll like it.  By the way, if you don't enjoy your dinner, my paypal account is run out of Nigeria, tread lightly when giving me your information.  I'm kidding of course, just disregard the whole refund offer and enjoy your dinner here!

The food was superb.  I mean, seriously great.  I ordered the Scallops with a light brown sugar sauce and asaparagus on the side.  The Bf ordered the 8oz filet mignon and the twice baked potato side.  We each ordered 2 drinks a piece, which, I have to say Eddie V's makes a damn good dirty martini and their blue cheese stuffed olives are to DIE for.  

Then dessert...oh sweet sweet dessert.  The bananas' foster was undeniabley the best dessert I have ever had.  It comes out flaming and the ice cream (we got vanilla, I detest butter pecan ice cream) was perfect to the warm goo-ey-ness of the cake which was a little carmel like...there are no words to explain how amazing this dessert was.

We were promptly seated and we ordered lots of appetizers to share. The beets and the polenta are sublime.

He understood my situation and was really comforting, because he is an expert at the insurance process. 

-- As he pulled up the parts he had a second screen on his desk facing me so I could see exactly what the parts were, what they looked like, where they fit on the car, if they were in stock or discontinued, and their actual cost. Then he discounted the cost or painting the parts on the estimate to meet my insurance company's rate, without my asking.

15866,1,1549670400000,"I'm not sure if I went on a off day or fellow yelpers in the cleveland area have never had a really amazing gyro. Food wise I think Steve's gets a 3.75 to 4 stars, total experience its 3 stars for me. 

For starters to get the gyro there was a 40 minute wait. This gyro in my opinion isn't worth a 40 minute wait. 10 to 20 minutes perhaps, but definitely not 40 minutes. 

Food: The meat was good, well seasoned and tasty, however it could have used a bit more crispyness to it. The sauce is strange but good in its own special way. I do wish they put more sauce on the gyro. The onions are pickled in vinegar I believe so they have a nice kick to them. I also really like how they are cut so they give a nice texture. The pita however was soaked in oil from the meat which I wasn't a fan of. 

Lasty as everyone said the lady behind the counter doesn't wear glove and has a lot of responsibilities. Such as cutting the meat, rolling the gyros, and touching money. Which freaked me out she touched the dirtiest thing in the world(Money) and my gyro. They also don't provide forks and this gyro can get messy with the amount of meat there is, and being they dont have tables to eat it.",3

15872,2,1550188800000,"First let me say that the show was amazing, but I'll come back to that in a minute ... we had an unfortunate experience at the theater tonight that I would like to address before I give my real input on the show.  
When we were escorted to our (rather expensive) seats, we found that our assigned table had been moved to a pretty crappy location.  The table I had chosen would have had an incredible view of 99% of the event.  On the other hand, the table they gave me had me looking at some guys butt all night instead.  Yes, it negatively impacted our enjoyment of the show, but  that is where Jovan (the floor manager) stepped up and did his best to rectify a horrible situation.  Since this was Christmas week, the show was sold out - so he had limited options.  He apologized (sincerely I might add), and gave me a full refund of my ticket price.  I realize that sometimes rotten things are going to happen and there is nothing you can do about them.  But Jovan's proactivity made the most of an incredibly bad situation.  THANKS JOVAN!!!
Now, onto the show:
I was a bit worried after reading some of the previous Yelp reviews.  I was vaguely familiar with The Great Gatsby, less familiar with Moulin Rouge, and somewhat more familiar with Romeo & Juliette - I really wondered if I would be able to follow the story.  As luck would have it, I only stayed on track for a mere fraction of the show.  (And even that was intermittent).  But it didn't seem to matter one bit.  I imagine that thoroughly knowing the movies may have added an additional level of interest, but the emotional content of the production was more than enough to satisfy me.  The performers were powerful, and delivered the messages straight to my heart.  
I would gladly see this show again and again.

The bread was great. All the bread in Pittsburgh is great (or at least most of it). Large, crispy, crunchy, fragile, toasty bread. The only complaint was it was corn dusted on the bottom. This makes for messy fingertips and a messy desk.

I got a steak hoagie. Four thick slices of steak and tons of browned, bubbly cheese. Very tasty. Unfortunately, they do serve their steaks Pittsburgh style....covered in lettuce and tomatoes. No biggy, I got mine without. The onions were crisp, fresh red onions. I would have prefered sauteed onions on a steak but its no big deal. They did charge me a buck for the bannana peppers, even though I left the more expensive tomatoes of my hoagie. And it appeared that they let Peter North put the mayonnaise on it, it was pretty much coated in the stuff.

Now, the important stuff: the food. We had the fried chicken, the smokey chicken and fish and chips. Portions were very generous and came with ample sides. There was also the option of ""upgrading"" the meal and adding another (generously sized) side for $5 (which we opted for the mac'n'cheese). The food was good, but could have used more flavor. I'm hoping that the food will only get better from here - they have the right idea with the menu (lots of great options) and add the fact that 80% of the menu is available around the clock, we shall await the slight improvements!

That said, the boozy milkshakes hit the spot! Great flavor and not lacking of booze...

As far as the service, the wait staff were friendly and attentive. The food did not take long to arrive, and the staff consistenly checked on our table if we needed anything throughout the evening. Our server in particular (named Julian) was very friendly, down to earth and knowledgable.

The only suggestion that I would like to give is perhaps when we were received the bill, that we could have been advised that payments are processed at the cashier (in the back portion, at the General Store counter). I would not have been an issue, but we got stuck behind a bigger group when we went to pay (while we had been sitting at our table assuming that a machine was available to round the tables).

All of the stylists I have ever had know what they are doing, and are qualified - but you need to be clear and firm with what you want. They have a reputation for edginess and seem to be determined to keep it. 

Yes, you get a bit of attitude here, but it doesn't bother me really. Neither does the music. I am not as ""open"" with my haircuts as I once was, but back when I was happy to ""experiment"" people were always asking me where I got my hair done. 

Jodi is fantastic (if she is still there).  Coupe was my go-to for years, but now that Rocky is gone I likely will not go back.  He has opened his own shop http://www.yelp.ca/biz/modern-lovers-hair-shop-toronto in Kensington. 

I have had only good experiences, but I am also not afraid to say ""whoh what are you doing"" or communicate what I want. Coupe is perfect for fun haircuts though, I have had enough experiences asking for something edgy at other salons and getting a slightly symmetrical bang and a one-length-blunt-edge cut. *no edge*

Basically, its ok. Its cheapish for downtown haircuts with experienced stylists.  Its not Aveda, but its not House of Lords *shudder* either.

16037,3,1549584000000,"Kudos to Fuji to buck the trend of open format dining rooms with natural lighting. Instead, they took a wide open space and compartmentalized it adding faux waterfalls, faux timbers, a sushi bar, a regular bar, dining room and a separate hibachi room all under one roof.  A literal maze with blue, green, and red lit ceilings. I simply don't understand it.
Menuwise, Fuji has your standard offerings-appetizers, rolls, sushi, sashimi, as well as a few entrees.  We opted for goyza, the sushi appetizer, yellowtail roll and a tuna specialty roll.  The rolls were well made and the sushi was cut well.  The specialty toll, Crazy Tuna, needed something more as the ""crunch"" that it was advertised with was missing.  Service was attentive although a little confusing as our waitress came to our table talking into her microphone (they all wear earpieces) and we thought she was addressing the table.
While the food was ok, the whole experience came off as gimmicky-from the decor to the chef walking around with the top of his hat on fire (at least I hope it was a gimmick!).  Just a strange experience overall.",3
16053,3,1550016000000,"This place was great for our family of 3 kids! And was located off the touristy main street, which is good and still easy to get to.  There were kids at a lot of tables. Staff was friendly and entertained and engaged us and other kids with pizza tossing. They were accommodating with ordering requests (ie:Pasta with butter, no basil topping, etc) and our kids loved the food as the adults did too. Though we went on Thursday evening, where it was DJ night, and the music was loud! But, it drowned out our kid's noises!
I ordered the Veal Milanese, it was enjoyed by my son and me. The calamari was enjoyed by all my kids, real calamari (not the weird even rings you see served at some places). We also had the Rosato Penne with Proscuitto. The proscuitto was a bit hard, but the pink sauce was very nice. Margarita pizza was delicious and enjoyed by my child. I was expecting it with round slices of mozzarella, but they used shredded and looked like a new york pizza. Also, had the beet salad and was delicious, big appetizer portion. They asked if we wanted goat cheese and we agreed without realizing it was additional cost until the bill came. Nevertheless, it as still delicious

16067,3,1550707200000,"Nice play on words Holy Grill!

Today with the sudden impending snow and colder weather, my cousin and I huddled for warmth and a good breakfast at the Grail.  I mean the Grill.  With the light snowfall and the view of MEC across the street one could even imagine themselves being at a mountain chalet.

The waitress was top notch, polite, quick and courteous, we ordered two Pacific Benedict, which is the usual suspect plus a nice portion of salmon.  They had actually brought us two regular Bennys, apologised for the mix up... but it was truly worth the wait.  Let me just say they were perfect, the poached eggs were done exquisitely, both holding their forms; and with the hint of lemon in the salmon and hollandaise sauce it was magnifique!

The highlight of my meal however was the potato wedges/chips that came with the meal.  Nice and crunchy, not oily. I could come in, just order a bag of these, sit in the corner and I would truly be a happy camper.

The space is really nice too, it is a small breakie place but done up just right, the grill to the right when you walk in, with the cafe space to the left, done up with beige colours, artwork and black covered tables.  Pretty simple but looking nice and elegant.  I would definitely come back and try something else here and recommend you do too.  Holy Grill is the Holy Grail.",2

16076,1,1550361600000,"Oh Sourdough Cafe. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways... um nevermind I don't even know where I was going with that one.

The other day was the first time I tried the prime rib. It was a surprisingly a really good 12 oz. men's cut prime rib which came with a soup or salad and a side for like $14.  For some reason I thought it was just as good maybe even a little better than the prime rib I had from a steakhouse earlier and it wasn't because it was cheaper.  I don't know how to describe how a prime rib should be besides it looked and tasted good and blood wasn't running all over the place. I'd definitely order it again. Do yourself a favor, if you're craving prime rib get the men's cut, they had a prime rib and shrimp special for like $10 but the prime rib just wasn't the same. Ask my mom who got her prime rib and shrimp plate after a couple of men's cut prime rib plates were brought to the table. haha. 

Just like almost every Vegas casino cafe has a menu that highlights a cheap steak and eggs deal or various late night deals. Sourdough Cafe is no different. Here they offer a decent sized cheap steak, forgot how many ounces, a couple of eggs, and hash brown for under $5. I use to come here pretty often for steak and eggs back in the day back when it was cheaper, it's still pretty cheap.  It's not the best or cheapest in town but if you're craving it and you're in the area you might as well save some gas money.  

It's not a fancy place, it's kind of old, and a lot of the food is standard but I like it. 3.5 star.

They acted like friendly professionals who went above and beyond to make sure the customers were kept aware of the time delays and gave us regular updates. On my way back, they started boarding us very early, and we arrived back in SFO very early.

Within 2 minutes of entering my home I find myself cornered in my children's bathroom being lectured and yelled at by this man about how children need to be told that toilets are not to be taken for granted. (Mind you, my children are teenagers and the leak was caused by a failed seal on the 30+ year old toilet, it had nothing to do with misuse by anyone) When he recommended the toilet be replaced, without even touching the toilet himself, I quickly agreed and then he proceeded to yell at me about how the last thing he's doing is bringing a catalog over for me to pick one out and if I don't like that I better not call their office or they will hang up on me. I didn't ask to pick one out or give any indication that I didn't want any type of toilet, standard or special.

I didn't expect that they had Lebanese food.  But,  they had a a huge variety of Lebanese food items, imported and made locally. I ended up. Picking up so many different items as I walked through the aisles.

I also couldn't help but notice the Turkish food and the Indian/Pakistani groceries available as well.  I love to cook and so,  next time I will also pick up some Indian food groceries.

Before I left,  I stopped by the butcher in the back and picked up some lamb chops.  They had rack of lamb and chopped it up for me as I requested.  When I arrived home yesterday,  I smelled the lamb and inspected it LOL ( bc I'm a freak about meat and can smell old/not fresh meat from miles away and vise versa).  This lamb was remarkably fresh and I was very pleased with my purchase.  I seasoned the chops overnight with some herbs and cooked them today over a grill. 

Obviously,  my cooking skills come into play here,  but the quality of meat cannot be overlooked. My husband and I enjoy6a very lovely dinner due to the fresh and quality lamb chops I purchased from Yafa market. 

Also,  FYI,  i found out from the cashier that you can call in a head of time to place an order to get wht you want before it runs out for the day.  I wanted chicken breast with the skin on when I originally came in,  but they were out. Next time,  I will call ahead. At least that's a sign of freshness.",2

I'm a huge fan of Anthony Bourdain's various foodie shows and always on the lookout to either try new things or learn more about ethnic foods. When he did an episode on Shanghai a few years ago, he visited a dumpling palace, how these delicious tid-bits are more than just a dim-sum staple. They have a history in China stretching back centuries, how ""soup dumplings"" the ones literally which have a soup inside are magically made and perfectly held together in their doughy exterior.

I only found out about this place a few days ago and after checking out the latest Peru exhibit at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, both of us were feeling peckish. Came here to check it out and so glad that we did. We only ordered the old stand-bys, pork and shrimp and lamb with green onions steamed dumplings and they were superb. I can't wait to go back and try out the rest of the menu. Another good sign, when we walked in at 5:30pm, the place was empty. An hour later, practically all the tables were taken up.

The place is incredibly clean and bright with plenty of seating. There is a small selection of ""bottoms"" to put in your cup before you select your yogurt so that you're not stuck with a cup of plain yogurt after you eat all the good stuff. It's a nice idea, though I do wish there was some fruit at the bottoms station too.

The flavor selection is pretty decent, and you can ask for samples if you can't decide. The first time I went I got the cupcake and vanilla flavors. The vanilla was nothing special, but the cupcake...holy cow. I dream of the stuff. I crave it more than I crave Haagen Dasz coffee ice cream, and that is saying something. The cupcake is a red velvet flavor that is rich and delicious and perfect in every way.

I went back again when the desire for cupcake yogurt became too much, and this time I dragged the hubster along. I got the cupcake (of course) and California tart which was surprisingly good! I wasn't anticipating a ""plain"" flavor to be so delicious. It was perfect with the strawberries and blueberries I got from the ""topping"" bar. Good thing I brought the hubster - he got the white chocolate for me to try, and it was amazing.

16240,3,1549497600000,"This Chatime is conveniently located near the Square One Bus Terminal so I always make a stop by the mall to get my fix of bubble tea whenever I'm commuting between cities. (Although if I have more time, I get my bubble tea at Real Fruit) Here's a summary of my experience:

Food:
My usual order is the Roasted Grass Jelly Milk Tea with less ice and 30% sugar. Personally I'm not a fan of too much sugar and their tapioca pearls aren't my cup of tea. For some reason, this location's drinks always taste a little watered down to me or the tea flavour isn't really distinct. While the milk tea was still ok, I've had better ones at other locations.

I also got to share some of my friend's Playful Passionfruit Strawberry drink from their new Spring Fling Menu with a rainbow jelly addition! It was nice to have some real strawberry chunks at the bottom, but if you're looking for some strawberry flavour in the drink, the passionfruit flavour overpowers much of the flavours. It seemed as though I was having a passionfruit drink, which true, it was refreshing and light, but I wanted more of the strawberry and green tea flavours to come out.

Atmosphere:
This Chatime was located in the Square One mall so there isn't much to comment about the atmosphere besides the few tables directly in front of the Chatime! It's loud and chat is at times in the mall but that's always expected in a busy commercial shopping centre.

Service:
Service was ok. The bobaristas were attentive and typical of Chatime employees. While the servers were friendly, their service was a little slow despite not having much of a line. I'm not sure if it was because they were understaffed at the time, but it wasn't as speedy as other Chatime locations.

Price:
For paying around $6 for each drink, the price is pretty standard.

Verdict:
This Chatime is a fine addition to the franchise as it's conveniently located by the bus terminal within the mall. While their drinks tasted a little watered down, it was still passable for a bubble tea drink. Trying new bubble tea flavours can be a hit or miss so next time, I'm sticking to my usual order instead of branching out. If you're commuting between cities and making a pitstop by Square One, I would recommend going the extra distance to get Real Fruit Bubble Tea in the mall instead of here.",3

This first round of sushi that we ordered, was... decent, maybe 3 stars, however when we ordered more sushi the fish was visibly lower quality fish (especially the albacore nigiri). I tried it anyway, knowing sometimes I can be picky about the way things look, and I had to spit it out into my napkin. I've never tasted such disgusting fish. My hubby even had to take one of his rolls apart because the fish on top wasn't fresh. The gyoza was awful. I think the best thing we got was the green salad with soggy tomatoes. 

In addition, this place is full of rules. They have a time limit of 45 minutes for their all you can eat menu - which is stressful and annoying when you are paying so much. Then, when you don't finish your CRAPPY meal, they have the nerve to charge you for the leftovers. 

And last but not least, Sushi Mon also gets one star less for decor - they had pieces of paper all over the walls with items you can order put up with scotch tape. I'm not super picky about decor, but it does matter some to me... SO NOT MY PLACE.

I had to ask for lettuce and sour cream which were not fresh and too cold. The waiter also seemed offended that I asked and generally didn't seem to want to be there. 

I'm never coming here over Dos again.",2

We made a reservation and were seated promptly. After being seated we admired the interesting decor, kind of modern meets rustic. Our server came over and I expressed to him my dairy issue, he then went out of his way to check with the chef to see what could be made dairy free. He then came back a made several recommendations on what to eat. We had the following:
Mussels: a generous portion in a white wine sauce, with chunks of chorizo
Tongue & cheek: perfectly cooked tender meat, with flavorful pieces of tongue
Lobster butter steak: amazing flavor and cooked very well

The crepe station is a great feature, and really elevates the style of the offerings.

Those who give it fewer than 4-5 stars or didn't think they got their money's worth where the ones who ordered the maki.  Don't make that mistake here.  Sushi 930 has some of the freshest, best sushi fish in the city, and ordering anything but the nigiri means You're Doing It Wrong.

It's not quite on par with Kaji or Yasu, but I would put their nigiri head-to-head with anywhere else in the city, at half the price.  The fish melts your mouth, requiring no soy or wasabi, as it shouldn't.  Their prices used to be even lower, which was downright crazy, and over time they've raised to a more reasonable level, but still nowhere near what you'd pay for the same quality elsewhere.  Yes, you will need to wait, and yes the takeout trays are flimsy and cheap, but if all you care about is amazing, well-prepared fish: here you go.",1
16349,1,1549584000000,"I will say, I expected A LOT from Okra, since my friends said such amazing things about their multitude of visits. It could have been that my expectations were too high. However, my experience was full of highs and lows. Unfortunately, mostly lows. We dined on Friday May 20 at about 7:30, on the patio (which was quite lovely). 
I started with the bright eye, bushy tail, on the recommendation of our server. So, I HATE dairy and in her description she never mentioned that there was dairy in it. Sure, I should have read the description so that was on me. I then ordered a sinister kid, which was delightful. 
We had the fried chicken skins and the hush puppies, which were both really tasty. I was quite happy with those. For my main, I ordered the Tennessee hot chicken, which was pretty awful, especially considering how wonderful the fried chicken skins are. First of all, I asked for a biscuit instead of cornbread, great. Well, the chicken arrived with pickles. Normally, if something seems as though it would come with pickles, I'd ask for them to hold the pickles, as they seep into whatever you're eating. But in what world would fried chicken come with pickles? The menu doesn't state this. So, the server (who was awesome) offered to get me a new plate, that was great. Unfortunately, when my plate was returned to me, my biscuit was covered in gravy. COVERED. Back to the dairy thing, I hate gravy. Had the menu said there was gravy, I would have asked for the biscuit without gravy. The gravy also got all over my chicken, and I wasn't about to complain about something else, so I just used my napkin to wipe as much off as I could. The chicken itself was cold and soggy. I have had Tennessee hot chicken plenty of times, and never has it been cold. It was also not spicy at all, which is kindof the whole point of ordering it. I tried my friends' dishes, the meatballs and the beef brasato, which were both far better than my cold chicken.
For dessert, we each had a donut, which was good, though very sweet. If you don't like sweet, you won't like this. It was almost too sweet for me, but it was pretty good. 
Overall, the starters were excellent, and the drink without dairy was delightful. I wish their menu was more informative and I wish my dish was served hot and not soggy. I would love to go back and give it another try, but based on my experience it would take a lot to get me back there.",2
16350,3,1550361600000,"Really great place to bring your kids for a fun and unique experience.  Small kids can climb in and strap themselves in (so they don't fly around inside the 'zorb ball' - granted someone needs to propel them) while bigger kids and adults can just pretend they're hamsters and manually roll around.

Family-owned, super nice and friendly owners.  Birthday parties are great to throw here since there's space to play and also space to setup chairs & tables.

It is a little hard to find if you've never been before and you're merely going off GPS.  Just park as close as you can get to Johnny Rockets.  If you're walking down the main walkway toward Harkins with Johnny Rockets on the right, then head right and you'll see it on the right side just a few businesses down.",2

Joe Miller, owner of ARIZONA PAINTING COMPANY came and looked at the house. He was very professional and he is going to make things right and it is so GREATLY appreciated. Depending on the redo I WOULD recommend this company but with detailed inspection during and after the job. This company has a 5 star rating and I really do hope they will shine!
*****************************
I hired Arizona Painting Company to paint the exterior of my home. BIG mistake. If I could give no stars that would be great!  A 2-3 day job turned into 1-1/2 weeks. The estimator painted a pretty picture but the pretty picture turned into not so pretty. We expressed that the trim and eves were not in good shape,replaced wood where he recommended and when done it looked like they had painted one coat. There was little prep work on their part. The brick on the body of the house looked they had used watered-down paint and I could see where they had used crack patching on the brick through the paint. Rather than pulling the ground from the base of the house to apply the sealer they sealed it to the level of the ground whatever the zig-zag shape it was. The front of the house had not been sealed at the base at all!!Contacted the production manager said some of it could not happen, some of the trim he would try and fix. Estimator called and told me that house would never look brand new....really? I understood that from the get go but just wanted it to look like it had been painted!! Look for a company that will prep your home before painting and will show up on a daily basis rather than a half day here, 2 days later there and not comment that they never promised a rose garden!! After 1-1/2 weeks, the production manager and worker were to return and fix the trim and main body on the house.....production manager did not show to help, worker was told only to fix under the patio and had 1 gallon left, no paint for main body, base of front of house never sealed. If you think about calling these people to do your home, you might as well paint it yourself!!! It will look 100% better!",2

16494,1,1551052800000,"As a person that travels a lot, I have really come to appreciate some very simple things.  The return of the ""nickle and dime"" program is really something I don't enjoy.

I think all of those fees need to be included and disclosed up front.  

The efforts some hotels and resorts go to in order to make your rooms very quiet is something else I think we all appreciate.

At this Kimpton FireSky location I could hear the water flowing from some pipe and the neighbors door open and close.  I don't know what pipe it was, but every once in a while I could just very clearly hear running water.  That doesn't happen at a lot of better hotels and resorts as I expected this to be.  

At the end I was in a hurry to catch a flight and only made sure there were no over charges for meals and the room rate was right.  I ignored the rest of the items.  Hotels have made me numb to them with all of the different taxes and resort fees.

When I got home and read the bill, I just felt embarrassed for paying the bill.  Rarely do I stay anywhere with a ""resort fee"".  When I made the reservation I was assured there was not one.  Somehow the FireSky took this to a whole new level I didn't expect.  There were extra charges for a $2.00 daily housekeeping gratuity, and a $7.00 bell gratuity.  I arrived after Midnight because of traffic so the only thing the bell hop did for me was say good-bye from the stand as I drove off.

Over all the food and location are very nice when visiting Scottsdale Arizona. You can walk downtown and they have a shuttle so you don't feel like you are trapped eating resort food.  Because this was a work trip, breakfast, lunch and one dinner were enjoyed on the patio,  the Traggia restaurant was very good and not priced much higher than places in town.

The pools are pretty cramped but still pretty nice.  The bottom line is I won't be back.  Of the three places I have stayed in Scottsdale, this one is three of three.
This is almost a 3 1/2 star because of the restaurant and pool staff.",1

16544,1,1551139200000,"Lovely spot for brunch, especially for those whose eyes are still partially open on Sunday mornings and cannot yet accommodate the piercing sunlight! Half of SOHO is pretty softly lit, creating a homey atmosphere. 

For brunch I ordered the Southern Benedict. I didn't know what to expect with the fried green tomatoes substituted for the typical English Muffin but the swap was surprisingly delightful. I was afraid that the combination of fried green tomatoes and Tabasco hollandaise would put me in a grease coma but it wasn't too overwhelmingly rich. The eggs were perfectly poached and had a creamy texture. The country ham carried almost a prosciutto like flavor profile -- definitely not the $2.99/lb salty ham you would find on sale at your local grocer a during post-holiday clearance. 

I wish I could give a five star review just based on the awesome Benedict alone, but that would not holistically reflect my dining experience. I snagged a piece of my friend's chicken and waffles and was quite disappointed. I understand the creative intention of pairing fried chicken with rosemary waffles, but sometimes, you shouldn't fix what ain't broken. To me, the rosemary was way too overpowering in a neutral waffle base: instead of complementing the crispy fried chicken, it was competing for attention on your palate. I had enough of the rosemary waffle after two bites. I can't imagine what my friend must have been going through.

Our wait staff was generally attentive and proactive. I was disappointed when she forgot about requests for more biscuits and ketchup :( 

Overall, SOHO has a lot of things right but shouldn't be afraid of being ""boring"" for not pushing the boundaries on a classic dish. This place has decent options too for vegetarian friends. For example, they can substitute avocado for country ham in the Benedict which is always a plus.",3

 If this establishment is going to offer Cajun shrimp only on Saturday one would think the management would make sure it would not happen again. This has happened for the third time now. We arrived at 6pm for dinner looking forward to Cajun shrimp only to be disappointed again. 
 When this was brought to the attention of the manager we were told there's nothing she can do. She said she throws pounds of coconut shrimp away every Saturday but cannot make less coconut shrimp and more Cajun shrimp because corporate will not allow it. We were not given an apology at all just an excuse along with an unpleasant attitude. 
 If this location is running out of Cajun shrimp before the dinner crowd arrives on the only night it is served it would probably be a good idea to change things up a bit. Apparently we are not the only ones that don't think coconut shrimp on a taco is appealing.

The good: The salad is good. It's not watery like a lot of other places. Drizzled with what seems like a soy sauce vinaigrette but I could be wrong. Soup was a grainy cream of potato. Definitely something I don't come across often!

The bad: So both times I came in, I've had some bad luck of the draw. Though the spaghetti is thin and is cooked al dente, it resembles ""Sidekick"" pasta, which is common in Japanese cuisine. I'm envious that both times I went my friend's mushroom garlic butter pasta/unagi don tasted relatively good, but something always seemed to be lacking on my plate. The first time I came in, garlic bread was missing, the second time, there was a lack of smoked salmon ( I got miniscule slivers which is probably half a slice shredded up).",2

Came here last night for a quick dinner (cuz it was almost empty with no wait) while Izakaya Go next door had a 30 min wait. Asked for a small size Pho noodle soup and was told no small size. I asked why, waiter said bluntly: ""It's the holiday."" What????? Excuse me??? I said it's not stated on the menu that you don't offer small bowl of Pho on holidays. He continued: "" You can talk to the boss."" Ok! Talked to the boss and got the same response. WTF!? Excuse my language-for whatever reason that you don't want to sell small size Pho, a simple apology with an offer for an alternative would put me at ease but you had to be rude and made me feel that ordering a small size Pho was my fault to begin with. The bad attitude was rediculous. I felt I was treated less of a customer and felt like being ripped off to buy a large Pho. Hello!!!!! Do you know why Izakaya Go was fully packed with a 30 min wait time while your Pho restaurant which is twice bigger but is only less than a quarter full with customers? On the day after Christmas?? Jesus Christ!! Here's why! Besides getting rid of your unfresh/bad smelly food/dishes (read from other Yelpers) and your whole other issues with hygiene and rude staffs, You need to improve by learning from your neighbor businesses. Businesses can't survive if you can't keep up with the competition nowadays and CUSTOMER SERVICE is a top priority in retail service industry especially restaurants. As soon as we found out we could get seated at Izakaya Go next door, we immediately left. May Lord bless you for God's sake... A negative star for this shitty place if it's an available option.",2
16579,3,1549670400000,"I decided to give Cherry's Berries a try because it's in close proximity to my gym. The inside is surprisingly clean and I question whether it's from lack of customers or because an employee is going around frequently sweeping the floors and wiping down the tables. 

I ordered the mango banana oatmeal sweetened with honey. While I was sitting down waiting for my smoothie to be made, the male employee asked me if he should use juice or milk and I told him whatever the recipe calls for. He pulls out a book to see how to make the smoothie.

When I tasted the smoothie, the ratios were off. There was too much ice which made every ingredient taste watered down and gave the smoothie a slush like consistency. I could hardly make out the banana or mango and even though the menu says sweetened with honey it tasted artificially sweetened. 

The lack of fresh fruits and low quality ingredients make the smoothies taste icy  and artificial.",1

They have really good espresso and my favorite dishes to get are the meat sauce lasagna, which is a very big portion at a very fair price, so I usually get to go and can enjoy it in two helpings.  The other thing I like to get is there breakfast calzone, served with ham and eggs, it is a great change to the regular breakfast.

The staff is very cool and the owner, who I usualy see in the day is a no nonsense sweety, that always has a warm smile and hello for her regulars.

16602,1,1549929600000,"Went here on a random Tuesday afternoon. We were one of a few people in the restaurant, and the only ones at the bar, initially. 
Add far as aesthetics, I've always loved the old fashioned fan above the bar, and the bar itself. It truly is a ""Pittsburgh"" bar. They have made some really smart enhancements, though. One, the open window bar overlooking the street. Love it! They also have a retractable awning for the patio seating which is thoughtful and unique to the area. 

We just had a drink, but I took a look at their new menu and it all sounds really tasty, and prices seem very fair. Nice style to the menu, also. As new bars come into the area, it's inevitable that a business might feel the need to change to keep up with their neighbors. Lot 17 had done just enough without ruining their already great vibe!
As always, very nice service!",2

I pay and get handed my food and drive to the front and open my burger and sure enough my burger has ketchup and mustard! No mind you my hands were already on this burger! I unload the kids walk into the store and tell them my burger was wrong and got an apology never mind the fact that the one whom serviced me already knew the burger was wrong and clearly didn't care enough to fix the problem! So the different cashier that takes the burger I already touched and puts it back on the line now I don't work in fast food anymore but I know it's common sense to throw food away that has been touched but apparently they missed the memo! So within not even 2 minutes I'm handed another burger with cheese that's not even melted. I think this location needs better employees and better health standards. Last time I had touched French fries that were supposed to be onion rings and they put those back as well. I thought that was a one time mistake but NOPE,1

16616,2,1549238400000,"IHOPs used to be good - at least in the US, they were.  I have a mixed report and will probably try going there once more.  I was impressed with the spaciousness of the waiting area and even inside the tables were spread far apart so you will never bump anyone behind you when you push out your chair.  The bathroom was also spacious.  I hate not having elbow room or being squashed in somewhere.  The coffee was a dark roast, tough for me to handle.  We used up our 10% cream the first round.  The waiter wasn't very observant as he was at our table a few times, yet did not bring any cream.  The coffee pot sits on your table the whole time but its no value if you don't have the cream for it.  My husband did not like their artificial sweetener (godawful Splenda has its 'unique' chemical flavor - any other kind is fine, Sugar Twin, Equal, Sweet & Low, even the no-name brands are fine).  I dug around my purse and found the good stuff so we managed to get by this time.  The meal I ordered had hash browns in a rectangular-molded shape so it turned me off as it appeared to be pre-made and just thrown on the grill that way.  I did not get toast with it.  It was a little bit of this and that and a variety of meat along with a pancake.  Without toast you would need to dip your pancake in your egg if you order that particular meal.  My husband got toast with his meal so I mooched from him.  He asked for peanut butter but the waiter had turned away after asking if we needed anything else, so he did not listen to us, so we had to wait until later to ask again - we got JIF peanut butter.  I'm not sure if this is good or not, as I have compared ingredient labels in stores and it seems we had to refrain from purchasing it in the past.  Eventually, we asked another server for cream and she brought it for us immediately.  I noticed that our waiter was right there on her heels after.  When we were leaving the manager handled my payment and asked how everything was so I  told him most of what I have said in this review.  He said he will definitely make sure they have a  variety  of sweeteners (I had also suggested the sugar in the raw - the brown stuff) for their sugar-caddy.  I said that forward-thinking people are required in all jobs and the waiter we had didn't measure up.  He gave me a 20% off discount & said he hopes we will come back again.  So this was the compensation for the strong coffee with the Splenda and insufficient cream.  I doubt if we would have got a discount if other staff had taken our payment.  It was busy at the till and there were several customers who heard me discuss it with him.  Not good for business.",2
16624,2,1549152000000,"01 Jun 2014, 07:30p

Hubby and I came here with a friend after I found it on Yelp.  The restaurant is located on the second floor of a fairly large strip center.  There were probably 3 or 4 parties present when we arrived and as those left, new ones arrived.  The restaurant appeared to do a good amount of business.

After perusing the menu and the accompanying photo album, I ordered the following for the table:

Roti Canai
Mee Goreng
Chilli Chicken
Deep Fried Eggplant w/Dried Shrimp & Garlic
Coconut Flavor Rice
Steamed White Rice
Mango Sticky Rice

Our friend ordered wine and hubby ordered a Tiger Beer which was described as slightly stronger than a Heineken.  The wine was not to our friend's liking, so I'm guessing if you're one who regularly drinks wine, this is not the place to order it as they only serve one brand, I believe.  Hubby enjoyed the beer, though, and since he ordered a large, he shared some of it with our friend.

I ordered the Roti Canai based on Yelp reviews not really knowing what to expect.  The tortilla/naan was very good as was the dipping ""sauce""?  There were a few pieces of potato and a small piece of chicken w/lots of bones in the bowl with the sauce.  I'm not sure if we were supposed to just dip the bread in the sauce or actually put the potato and chicken in the bread and wrap it up like a burrito.  Regardless, the bones in the chicken made that a little difficult so we ended up just dipping.  The sauce was quite tasty!  Note, this appetizer really isn't large enough to share.

The Mee Goreng was different than what I had had before, but it was very good.  It was weird to get some potato in that, also, but the flavors and different textures all meshed well together.  The noodles seemed different from what I had had before, but it's been so long that I can't even remember what it's supposed to be like.  Regardless, it was good.  This was our friend's favorite dish of the dinner.

The Deep Fried Eggplant wDried Shrimp & Garlic arrived next and this dish was also very flavorful.  There was a large amount of eggplant and it was fried just enough to be crispy on the outside, but still silky smooth on the inside.  Flavors were fantastic and the dried shrimp added a bit of a crunchy texture, too.

The Chilli Chicken was by far my favorite entree of the dinner.  At first taste, the chicken was a bit dry, but it tasted really good.  The heat doesn't hit immediately and the initial flavor sort of dovetailed into the heat.  Hard to describe, but the complexities to get this flavor would be difficult to reproduce (which hubby is going to try!).

The Coconut Flavor Rice was not very exciting in my opinion.  The coconut flavor was so subtle that I didn't really even taste it with all the other flavors going on.  Also, it's difficult to share two bowls of rice amongst three people when you're just given plates and chopsticks.  Forks or extra bowls need to be requested.

For dessert, I wanted to try the mango sticky rice.  I asked if they had good mangoes and they said they weren't too sweet nor too sour.  The should have been a sign right there.  It was not good.  The rice wasn't bad, but the coconut milk was a bit watery and the mango was not ripe.  Lesson learned.  Maybe next time I'll try the shave-ice concoction.

I'd come back and try different dishes at this restaurant.  I know a few to avoid already, but there are also a few I'd definitely order again.  Staff was friendly and attentive, although I think sometimes had a problem understanding our questions due to the language barrier.  Very reasonably-priced, too!",2
16628,3,1550793600000,"During my last Vegas trip Cashman @ Cirque took our group pictures.

They were quite cute, though we either would have preferred more direction or less direction as per the pictures, especially considering the two we received were almost exactly the same facially.

We weren't offered any online pics (that would have been awesome) but ended up purchasing the two in the book for $45, which considering we paid almost $200 per ticket, split between two of us, wasn't that bad.

A nice memory of the visit, but much more frou frou than it needed to be. We could have done without the book and would have been willing to download the online pictures for a small fee. I'd love to see them switch over to an easier system.",3

I don't remember the girl's name, but I showed her one picture of a Taylor Swift hairstyle I wanted, and she did a great job!  My hair stayed in tact, which was my biggest worry.

When the drink was brought out by a unknown male who didn't introduce himself or anything just looked and sat the drink down then walked off. So then the lady who was supposed to be our waitress walked by us a total of 3 times I'll be back to take your order. Waited about 10 more mins after that. So finally she comes over and says, may I take your order? Um! No! I Dont like your attitude and I've been waiting entirely to long. I asked for the ticket for my drink and left. Needless to say what started out as an exciting morning for my sister and I on her birthday trip to Vegas has put a sour taste in our mouth. A word of advice to Beth the waitress, have a coke and a smile greet your guest with a warm and friendly attitude not like your tired and don't want to be at work.",2

16785,2,1549584000000,"I came here for an anniversary dinner having heard many great things about this restaurant. We ordered the lobster mac n cheese to start ($14). We shared it and were not impressed at all with it. There was way to much much and cheese and not enough lobster. The chunks of lobster were barely the size of a nickle. I got maybe 3 chunks of lobster... it was dissapointing. We then ordered the lobster dinner ( I think it was close to 40 I could be wrong) it came with a small scoop of mashed potatoes, and cream of spinach. The sides were nothing amazing but the lobster it self was pretty bad. The shell was hard as a rock and the meat was all shriveled up. The lobster was also very small... 

The waitress we had also wasnt the friendliest of people. She didn't come around once to refill our drinks or ask us if everything was ok. We also had to chase her down to get our bill. 

over priced. over rated.

Well about an hour later they called me telling me my front brakes needed changed. I said ok but what's that rattling noise and he said they didn't hear it. I picked it up after work and as soon as I hit the gas it made the noise. I then called Summerfield Auto in Waxhaw and they told to drop it off and they'll take a look. Needless to say they found the problem and it was a bent pipe underneath. They bent it back and the noise is gone. They also realized the wrong oil was in there. It's a hybrid so it's supposed to be running synthetic. Woodies didn't find any of this I will never take my car there again.,2

I love how this place is very clean. I was greeted and helped right away. I picked out a color and the girl who worked on me was Thao.

She was awesome! I loved my mani & pedi. My nails were very clean and I loved how she shaped them. None of them were uneven or lopped sided. I felt so relaxed during my service. It looked great after she had worked on them. I was very pleased with my service.

We quickly decided to leave but had gotten turned around as to where the exit was.  It took at least 10 minutes of walking along the chain link fence before we found an exit.

16809,2,1550275200000,"Marché Bacchus is an awesome restaurant from top to bottom. The atmosphere, the wine, the food & the experience all play into making it one of my all time favorites.The location is off-strip, located in Summerlin, positioned lake-side within a neighborhood. This gives a great ambiance, allowing you to disassociate from the city-life/fast pace of Vegas and really hone into having a relaxing evening with great food, wine & company. The wine store turns into a beautiful dining room, making it truly a unique experience to dine here. You have the option to pick out wine prior to seating, get up during your meal to pick-out more, and also purchase wine to go. 

We dine here frequently off their a la carte menu, but especially love when they host events or wine dinners. Bastille Day was one of our favorite events, but most recently we dined here for the Freemark Abbey Wine Dinner on Thursday Jan 19th, 2017. The restaurant does wine dinners about once a month, really highlighting a specific winery & setting up a tasting menu to really highlight the wine, and showcase the level of cuisine at Marché Bacchus. This wine dinner was especially interesting because the restaurant is celebrating bringing in a new executive chef Tom Moloney. 

The pairing was six unique glasses with four delicious courses:

1.) appetizer: Butter poached Maine lobster w/ heirloom tomatoes, popcorn shoots, sweet onion, red radish in a lobster sauce
2.) second course: Roasted Stuffed Quail w/ Foie Gras + exotic wild mushrooms 
3.) third/main course: 28 day dry-aged Ribeye w/ marble potatoes, mushrooms in a cab sauv. reduction
4.) fourth course: Artisan cheese plate


Overall the meal, and pairing was absolutely fantastic. The Butter poached Maine lobster was an excellent portion of fresh lobster, really delicious and representing a umami in flavor. 

The second course though, was my absolute favorite. I have never had the pleasure of eating quail before (first experience) and it was absolutely phenomenal. I loved the sizing of the bird & smallness of the bones within the wing. The cook was delicious, roasted to perfection and evenly stuffed with wild mushrooms & foie gras.

I was worried that because I enjoyed the quail so much the steak would lack in luster. I was VERY incorrect. The steak was perfectly cut and cooked, oozing with flavor and really diverse from the previous course/pairing. I absolutely loved the Cabernet Sauvignon reduction, and had only wished the potato portion had been more, or prepared as pommes puree to soak up the reduction & delicious flavoring.

The artisan cheese plate followed, consisting of a selection soft & mild cheeses. I prefer more obtuse bodied and aged cheeses, making this not my favorite of cheese selections. I loved, LOVED the idea of having cheese over a sweet desert, and adored the pickled peppers/onions so much I stole my boyfriends though!

We ended the meal with cappuccinos & an additional tasting of 1984 Freemark Abbey in the wine shop. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves immensely, and conversation carried late into the evening. The owners Tom & Rhonda really know how to throw an awesome event, and run an outstanding food & beverage establishment. Can't wait till our next meal, and especially till the next wine dinner!",2

16834,1,1551052800000,"With Chinese restaurants, I always tell my friends that you're dining at them for the food, not the service.  Service is always secondary and to lower your expectations substantially.  

That said, the Szechwan food they make here is pretty spot on as far as authenticity is concerned.  Good use of the Ma-la seasonings and Szechwan peppercorns that give you the spiciness and the mouth numbing qualities.  

The Dan Dan Mian is pretty basic, using what I am sure is spaghetti noodles, and placing the noodles into a small bowl with ma-la chile sauce, with a tiny bit of ground pork and some greens.  Toss the noodles around and mix that sauce in well, and you'll get good flavor with a nice heat and numbing sensation from the dish.

I noticed they had a dry hot pot dish made with Tea Tree Mushrooms, and ingredient I have never seen before.  It was dehydrated and packaged before being exported for retail sales.  With this dish, they weren't able to allow enough time to rehydrate the mushrooms so that they can be a little tender when cooked.  Rather, we ended up with a dish that was well seasoned, but the mushrooms were mostly tough and chewy....very difficult to eat.  

The last dish we had was a combination dish with fish filet, beef, chicken, shrimp and vegetables (mainly bean sprouts and celery).  This dish was cooked well and had good heat to it.",2

Your guests are in other lines unless you want the same food. This mean the only time you socialize is while you are in line waiting to place an order. Needless to say, all the food does no come ready at the same time. So you and your guests may not eat together. Oh, you want a drink, that's ANOTHER line. You get it, you spend a lot of money to wait in line. This is NOT the american way. People want to be served and have dinner and drinks TOGETHER with friends not in phases.

We got Thai Tea, Mango Slush with lychee jelly, and the Hokkaido Tea. Though it was busy, we only waited maybe around 5-10 minutes for our drinks which is pretty good considering that it was just hectic in there.  I got the mango slush which I enjoyed. It had a good mango flavor and wasnt watered down at all.  You could choose your sweetness level, I got regular and my sister got 50%. I felt that the regular sweetness wasnt overwhelming so A+ to that.  I was also suprised at the amount of lychee jelly they gave me.

The good:  The selection of food/drink options is great.  I stopped in at Fortuna and found they had several nice bottles of wine at half off!  They offered up a nice selection too at around $10/bottle.  The happy hour at Hacienda Margarita is great, granted the regular price of a mexican beer is $6 so at $3 it brings it down to a regular price.  With the appetizers also at half price, HH becomes an excellent deal.  The buffet was actually really good and included champagne at breakfast.  The food looked very fresh, there was a huge selection of items, and everything I tried tasted great.  As an Honors member I received this complimentary with my stay.  The spa area is also very nice.  It has a couple of saunas and a steam room and the locker room is filled with great extras such as fancy lotions, etc.  They also provide fruit and bottled water.  This too is included in your stay if you are an honors member.  

The bad:  I was told there wasn't an executive level for Honors members which seems odd since other reviewers have mentioned there is one.  While I was upgraded to a large suite, it was very outdated.  Some of the outlets did not work.  The wet bar didn't have any glassware, utensils, or microwave.  It did have a refrigerator but it seemed to be on its last leg.  The information book in the room didn't really provide much information about the facility which is unfortunate because there is really a lot of options in entertainment, dining, shopping, and relaxing.  They could really capitalize on it better if they provided more information.

I appreciated the fact that there wasn't a casino in the hotel like most of the other hotels is Vegas. It was a nice place to come back to after a night of gambling, clubbing, drinking, and whatever other shenanigans the strip had to offer. 

The room was gorgeous! It felt like a condo. The bathroom was huge! It had a large walk in shower and tub. Both could easily fit 4 people! There was a little kitchen area, complete with microwave, dishwasher, stove top, and dishes and utensils. The bed was super plush and comfortable. However, I slept on the pull out sofa bed most of my stay there and it was actually pretty comfortable. Just don't try to fit another person in the bed; it's not so comfortable at that point. 

There's a shuttle to the Wynn and Caesar's Palace. My friends and I took full advantage of the shuttle service. All the drivers were so kind and friendly. My friends and I chatted up all of them and asked for advice and recommendations. Not only were the drivers really nice, the entire staff at the Trump were great! We were always greeted with a smile. One evening we were heading to the Rio for dinner and one of the managers called one of their cars for us instead of a cab. It seemed like such a small gesture but truly appreciated. 

Last but not least, the pool. It was a very quiet pool with more families than party people. It was actually relaxing to sit by or in the pool instead of worrying about how I looked or if everyone was judging me. I definitely do not need a Vegas-style pool party.

The servers looked disengaged.  The food was cold and stale (appetizers).  They did NOT have a drink menu.  Apparently all they knew how to serve was beer. 
They said they could ""make anything"".  I beg to differ.  The margarita I ordered was like a frozen snowball.  It barely melted after an hour and a half.  I could tip it almost upside down and nothing came out.  Pretty sure there was no alcohol in it either.

The service was spotty.  There were like 6 of us at the beginning but then another six joined.  The server was like oh are you new to the party?  You didn't notice we doubled in size?

Jason rudely blamed on me that I put the name myself, that's why I didn't get device. I immediately pointed out that he put my name, he did not even apologize and gave me a shitty look. I later on returned the device and said that I could not stand their customer service, I needed to leave. Jason replied,""don't come back"" 
Yes, I would never come back.",2

From leashes to different harnesses and high quality toys and foods. The barkery treats are super cute and my floof ball woofed one down with delight! 

We went there to hose off her doggie stink and so glad we did! This is my first time not taking her to a groomer, and it takes some time! She's beautiful & smells like sugar cookies (kinda like a puppy stripper) totally appropriate for Viva la Puppy!  And she is so very soft following the oil treatment, so worth the extra 5 bucks.

And they have customer loyalty cards! Buy 9 get 1. This is the spot where all the cool dogs go!",2

ANGARA INDIA SPICE GRILL IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED!
We visited Angara India Spice Grill for lunch today, expecting to try out a new restaurant. Instead, we ended up leaving disappointed and angry. Here's the story:
Wife found a coupon on Restaurant.com for this place, which we'd never tried before. The coupon was for $25 (it cost $10), with a minimum purchase of $50. The net cost (in retail) to the restaurant amounts to $15.
Angara India Spice Grill is in a strip mall, near a Target store. There are at least two OUTSTANDING Indian restaurants in the neighborhood -- Curry Leaf and Mint. So, we were not exactly shopping for another Indian food place, but the coupon makes this worth a try for first-timers.
Reviews posted at the usual sites were positive. Good food, Clean place. Certainly, Angara was enticing for those who enjoy Indian cuisine.
We arrived at exactly 2:32 pm on a Tuesday afternoon. Note the exact time, because it's important. The website and hours on the door are posted as LUNCH: 11 am -- 3 pm. So, we were 28 minutes prior to close. Dinner began at 5 pm.
We were seated and were told the coupon would not be valid. An Indian waiter, who presumably was also the owner-manager said the coupon did not apply to the lunch buffet. By the way, we were the ONLY CUSTOMERS in the restaurant.
We explained that we were not interested in the buffet. We planned to order off the menu and would gladly order $50 worth of food. The waiter-manager-owner stated firmly that we would not be able to order off the menu. We stated that we would pay dinner prices (even though the coupon made no distinction between lunch and dinner). Waiter-manager-owner-weasel then fabricated some tale that the ""lunch ala cart menu ends at 2;30.""
Wait. So, the restaurant is open for lunch until 3 pm. But we can't order off the menu after 2;30. And, it's now 2:32.
Seriously?
I stand up in stunned silence and begin to march towards the front door. Wife, who can be just as much a bulldog as me if the wrong buttons get pushed, tells the waiter-manager-owner that we would have gladly taken lunch anyway we could get it, even off the buffet. The restaurant would charge us $50, get two new customers, and the waiter would even earn a $10 tip (20 percent). How the hell can they be TURNING AWAY customers? THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!
I was out to the parking lot and wife said she wanted to go back inside and tell him more of what she thought of this situation.  Wife went inside and explained that we'd become loyal customers of their competition Curry Leaf entirely because they offered a coupon for first-timers and that ended up producing perhaps 50-60 visits over the next three years. Don't they see the UPSIDE of offering a meal and honoring their own coupon?
Instead, they make up excuses. They don't list the details on the coupon. They even reinvent the hours of operation on the spot.
Of course, we are NEVER GOING BACK. They are history. Dead to us. To see a completely empty restaurant turn away two paying customers which guarantees them some profit along, with the upside of future loyalty, strikes me monumental stupidity.
This situation was handled very, very poorly. I urge others to avoid Angara India Spice Grill. Their word cannot be trusted!",2

I love it.

I need to first make clear that the food is delicious. EVERYTHING was spot on, and exceeded my expectations for Vietnamese food based on my experiences with other such restaurants. 

The menu is English speaker friendly, an important feature most Vietnamese restaurants are unfortunately missing - this is mostly what I mean when I say it is americanized.

The food retains authentic flavor while also making a more comfortable experience for those unaccustomed to Vietnamese food.

Delicious food, great atmosphere, 5/5 would Vermicelli again.",2
17054,3,1550102400000,"I hardly ever write reviews but I have been coming here regularly since they opened, and always loved it but over the last few months the quality has gotten terrible. The website specifically says they have portobello mushrooms and kalamata olives, although I believe they used to be a delicious marinated sliced white mushroom. The last two times I have had my husband pick salads up from there I have ended up with canned mushrooms and canned black olives. This might sound petty, but as a vegetarian, these two items used to pack my salads with flavor. Now it is just pathetic. It ends up a soggy bland mess. Management, please step up your game. I would like to continue to frequent your establishment!!!",2
17055,1,1550534400000,"I feel betrayed.  My second visit to Harlem Underground was a disaster, and I'd been talking it up to my dinner companion for weeks.  I actually feel embarrassed.  At first I thought maybe I'd just ordered wrong, but my friend had what I had on my first visit, fried chicken with waffles--the house specialty, and was distinctly unimpressed.  

I had the turkey meatloaf, feeling in the mood for something less egregiously unhealthy than fried chicken, and it was terrible.  Dry and bland and sort of chewy.  It was improved by a nice though small side of steamed spinach with a slightly sweet (maple syrupy?), buttery sauce, but that wasn't enough to rescue it.  

We both had a side of mac and cheese, me because they were out of sweet potato fries (odd, since earlier that afternoon I bought sweet potatoes at the grocery across the street).  It was not totally awful but it tasted like it had been sitting around for a while.

Two things rescued it from one star: the service and the red velvet cake, the latter of which I doubt was made anywhere near the premises and even a bit dry, but nonetheless authentic and delicious.  Thank you Liam, our charming and on the ball server.  I hope the lackluster food doesn't screw you out of the tips you deserve.

I'm eager to see what other reviewers have to say, because clearly my experiences are wildly inconsistent.",2

The food is mediocre at best - nothing was horrible, but for the price, it should have been wayyy better.  Also, a person in my party ordered a salad - and it was served with half-rotten cucumbers sitting right on top!  We saw it right away when they set it down - it was disgusting.  There is no way that the person making the salad could have missed it - they just didn't care and served it anyway!

I've never had this issue before and I'm really upset that I wasted $115 (after tip) for lashes that have been falling off like crazy. I did everything right post care so there is no reason why this should be happening outside of shotty work in the first place. I can't vouch for how they do eyebrows but if my lashes are any indication I'll pass!",1
17086,1,1550793600000,"Here are my pros-
Lots of items you can get for a lower price than anywhere else.
Lots of employees who recognize you when you are a frequent customer.
Always lots of lanes open so wait time is never very long.
Open until 11pm which is late enough so no one has to work all-nighters.
Pretty clean and organized.

My cons-
Lots of scary people wandering around inside and out.  Not sure why there is not security.  Always makes me nervous.
Lots of the same employees are there A LOT!  I know people need hours but that also can compromise customer interaction.

P.S.  Don't wear blue.  Someone thought I worked there.  I told them I didn't but could help them anyway. Hmmmmm......",2

They ask a nurse ""how much longer"" and her reply was ""as long as it takes me!""  She broke her toe, got a splint, crutches and a prescription.

Deciding to live on the edge, I drove about a 3/4 of a mile to find that the place is one of those hand car wash places where customers put quarters in and wash cars with those wands with brushes that squirt out soap and water.  However, the stalls have been taken over by Valle Verde.  There were three people working there: a gentleman, a lady, and a younger kid--I'm guessing this is a family operation.  In about 30 minutes, the car was spic and span inside and out, plus the carpets were shampooed.  This is a CASH ONLY establishment so be prepared for that.

The suggestions for the Prosciutto Salad, Sweet Corn App and Kobe Carpaccio and the Bone Marrow were awesome.  We had a few of the infused cocktails and they were all super amazing as well.  The Old fashioned is totally a great taste!  Our bartenders Jillian (sp) and Roberto were formal, informative and gave some great suggestions.  The atmosphere is cowboy western motif meets modern art.  The portions are sized appropiately for the apps and to get something started but it is a bit on the pricier side.

I have never once been charged to balance my tires at pep boys, and I was still willing to pay the $60 she was going to charge me.

I really love how the ice cream is freshly made by the store itself (or so they say? I don't know if anyone can confirm or deny this). It's hard to find this anywhere...especially where I'm from in the states. 

Service was good - our food came quickly and the servers were friendly. I ordered a mint green tea to go along with my crepe, which I thought was a bit pricey, but oh well.

It would've been nice if there was one or two savory crepes on the menu, but I mean I get that it's a dessert shop. Also, what's up with the menu saying no photography allowed? Was this pre-Instagram? None of the waiters enforced this rule but it's just slightly discomforting that it's even there.

I wish I tried one of their savory menu items, but we came here right after having dinner. We just thought it would be great to grab some dessert, since we were in the area. Their menu had a list of soups, omelets, and breakfast sandwiches. All the more reason to come back! 

Another great thing about this place is that they give you the option of making your own gift basket. If you check one of the photos I have posted, you'll see the section where you can pick ribbons, boxes, baskets, and other lil things to make your own gift set. They also sell random trinkets. So cute!

This establishment sits right at the intersection of Craig & Tenaya, and is right across the street from a Starbucks. It's great for those who are just bias to having coffee from Starbucks. These two businesses are an awesome pairing. lol

Upon my most recent trip here, my wife and I split a half roasted chicken which comes with 2 sides. We ended up getting sweet potato fries and chicken soup. If you are a fan of any soup, I recommend this one as a side. It's broth based, but they don't kill it with salt and load it down with huge chunks of chicken, rice, vegetables, and cilantro. A must have if I get sick this winter! Also the chicken is a can't miss. Don't forget to get the dipping sauces located in the back of the restaurant. I recommend the yellow (tangy) and red (spicy).

We arrived here about 4:20pm and were seated quickly. With drink orders taken, the task of deciding what to order is at hand. I finally settle on one of the specials of the day. It was a  spearfish with mango pineapple salsa. This is a risk for me as I don't normally order fish when I am eating out but this one sounded so good. The rest of the table ordered their usual dishes.

I was pleasantly pleased when my dinner came. While the sides were plentiful, the fish and salsa were just the right size. I was even happier when I took the first bite. The fish was moist and flavorful but not fishy. I was able to finish off my fish for dinner but had to bring home most of the sides.

When I am back in Mesa, AZ, I will definitely make another stop at the Red White and Brew!",1

It was expensive for a lunch. I had the weekly special burger, fries, and a soda $13.45 without tip. I sat at the bar and dealt with the bartender yelling ""Peanuts""  the whole time.

17256,2,1549670400000,I'm sorry but I wouldn't go back here. Location is kind of hidden in the back of a shopping center. I had a gift card from restaurant.com and thought this place was worth a try. For one the pizza isn't Chicago deep dish pizza as advertized. It is super thin and not that good at all-tastes like cheap frozen pizza. Service was extremely slow and server kept forgetting basic things like silverware/straws/etc..(granted they seemed to be slammed with only 1 server-hello management). We never got our appetizers until the meal came out and the server was just like oh yea about it. Sure you can get a ton for the prizing (big pizza pies) but it's not noteworthy food or service at all.,2

It's right next to the humongous Las Vegas Convention centre and it's conference centre is often an ""overflow"" area for large conventions (such as the National Association of Broadcasters convention that I attend every year). For it's whole history except the first and past two years it's been known as the ""Las Vegas Hilton"" and most long time conventioneers still refer to it that way.

I don't stay here (I think there are much better values in Las Vegas, especially during conventions) but I come here every year for various functions. There are numerous ""hospitality suites"" here during conventions and I came to one on the top floor in one of their ""villas"". Those are certainly modest compare to newer mega-resort on the strip but it is convenient. I also come here sometimes for the buffet which is nice and a (fairly) short walk from the back of the ""central hall"" of the LVCC entering here through the ""sports books"" area. The ""sports book"" parking is also convenient if you come to the buffet.",2
17273,2,1550534400000,"There's a reason why Mastro's has such high reviews.  Good service and incredible food.  My experience was no different.

From the outside, the restaurant is housed in a cool modern treehouse.  On the inside, it's what you would expect from your typical fine-dining establishment.  The service here is attentive and accommodating.   They pay attention to detail by offering a black or white napkin depending on your attire. 

The food?  Perhaps some of the best I've had in Las Vegas.  Let's start with the bread basket.  It was mixed with a variety of carb-loaded treats.  Olive focaccia, soft pretzel, etc.  

We ordered the Spicy Mambo Salad and the Ocean Club House Salad for the table.  Both portions were very generous and each is enough for an individual meal.  Both were delicious but have their own individual personalities.  The Spicy Mambo Salad has no protein and is reminiscent of a caesar salad with hints of wasabi.  The Ocean Club House Salad had bits of lobster and shrimp and were well balanced.  We also order a side of macaroni and cheese for the table.  The ""side"" was huge and plenty for a table.  In fact, we had some left over for a party of seven.  Again, delicious.

For my entree, I had the 12 oz. filet.  I ordered it medium rare as I normally do.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender to the point that I could have peel off pieces with only my fork.  It's arguably the best steak I've ever had.  A friend order the sea bass, and unlike other fine-dining restaurants I've been to... the portion was huge.  The sea bass had a lightly seasoned crust and super white in color throughout.  It was flaky, yet melted in your mouth.  This was by far the best sea bass I've ever had. 

The reasons I didn't give Mastro's five-stars?  Three reasons.  First, the waiter seemed to have a little attitude when one of our guests requested separate checks.  And second, they had a band playing there that night.  I'm not sure if this is a common nightly play.  But, I'd rather not listen to a 70's - 90's cover band while I eat a fine meal.  Lastly, I couldn't overcome the fact that every time I looked around... I was still in a retail shopping center.  I love views, but not that of shoppers walking in and out of Louis Vuitton, Prada, etc.",2

They don't even look at all your clothes they take on look at maybe 4 items & conclude that all the rest are either worn or just not worth looking at. I watched them do this with my items. Almost all the clothes I went to sell had tags on them brand spanking new & they didn't even get to them. Plus everything in their store looks like they went to marshals & just bought a bundle of things in different sizes. I wouldn't consider this place a consignment store.,2

Their shahi paneer is the best. I love their chana bhatura as well which is $4.50 I think. Trust me this place is a gem. All the food items are really really tasty and cheap, that's why the place get crowded quickly. 

For some, service could be a turn off as it's all self service place. But I go there to enjoy food without worrying about the price/service. The only reason I am not giving them 5 star is the servers limit the amount paneer they're serving in the platter. This started happing recently and has happened couple of time with me. They will only put 1 or 2 pieces of paneer which is a big turn off for me. One time, I even saw the girl taking out the extra paneer that she put accidently which I think is not a great service.

We were on the 34th floor facing north. There's a television in the mirror of the bathroom! The room was super posh - King bed, queen pullout (my friend actually opted to sleep on the couch, as a couch. She promised me it wasn't because I smelled funny... 

Speaking of smells! That spa smell that everyone's talking about? It really exists! It smells really luxurious inside the Trump, for REAL. The dresses I left hanging in the closet smelled so nice after I unpacked them, and even did my sleeping clothes from being in the sheets! A great non-smoking retreat, for sure. Seriously amazing. If you want to smell rich, stay at the Trump! 

As I wanted a chill day with friends, I reserved a poolside cabana for the day - $150, plus a 20% gratuity. The gratuity was worth it; our server, Brittany, was so nice and attentive, I tipped her extra. The TV was a great way to watch the game, and the food from the H2eau cafe (including two pitchers of frozen cocktails), was a perfect way to spend 7.5 hours. The pool is very much a hangout pool. It's not deep, so you can just stand in it and enjoy your drink. However, as the sun starts to set, the adults go inside to prep for a late night, and it gets inundated with splashy kids. 

Late checkout? No problem! (Not for us, at least.) 

It's across the street from Fashion Show Mall, the Nordstrom. You literally just walk across the crosswalk and you're there! 

For $11, you can get direct shuttle service to the airport, every hour on the hour. 

There were a few cons, but nothing to detract. 

The trains do roll through, but they were hardly noticeable for us city folk. If you're from somewhere super quiet, you'd probably get annoyed by this, but then... why are you expecting to sleep in Vegas? 

The sangria was terrible. Stick with hard liquor cocktails. 

It's not right on the strip, so be prepared to take cabs. The shuttle service was woefully inadequate. It never seemed to appear on time, and sometimes it was so full you couldn't get on anyways.

Friday night, our first night, we went to the Palms as requested.  I forgot how much I like the Palms as it has been a long time since I have been there.  It was free to get in all of the clubs and the wait to get in was not that long.  We went to Rain, Playboy Club, and Moon.  We had so much fun at all three clubs.  

On Saturday we decided to go to Tao at the Venetian.  Chris hooked us up with their promoter, Darko.  We didn't have to pay to get in.  The wait was not that long either. Ladies drink free from 10:30-11:30 p.m. which was great. The dance floor was pretty packed but we had a blast dancing and drinking. Afterwards, we decided to go back to the Palms and chill out at the Playboy Club.  All I had to do was text Chris and we were able to go back, with another friend joining us, with no issues or problems!   

For our last night on Sunday, we went to Koi at Planet Hollywood.  Again, it was free to get in and free drinks for the ladies from 10:30 p.m.-12:00 a.m.  The drinks were probably the strongest here. The atmosphere was nice and pretty chill as compared to the two nights before.

If I spend HOURS a day, I could apply enough heat and product to my hair to make it look halfway decent...but who has the time for that? So I resolved to throwing it into that ""messy bun"" look that's (thankfully) popular right now.
That is, until Kyle's artistry came into my life.
I have been a loyal client of Kyle's for almost a year now.  If you follow hairbykyle on instagram, you'll know who I am right away: I'm the before and after that LITERALLY looks like he took a sad homeless woman off the street and turned her into a disney princess... that's me.
Anyways, Kyle's magic has literally transformed my hair.
An award winner in Brazillian Blowouts, Kyle smoothed the texture of my hair: now I run a blowdryer through my damp hair for 5 mins and it's smoothed to perfection without any additional effort.
His sheer genius when it comes to color has added depth and dimension to my natural red hair.  He truly finds ways to not COVER it up but rather enhance my color.
And of course, he's a pro with a pair of shears.  He always finishes up my look with natural layers that fall perfectly.
If that weren't all, he truly makes me feel comfortable discussing my concerns with my hair.  He doesn't judge me and ensures me that I will walk out of that salon feeling beautiful...and he's always right.  I trust Kyle to the point where I now walk into the salon, give him a bear hug, start gossiping with him and realize halfway through the appointment that I haven't even told him what I wanted: he just starts working like the artist he is.  
He is AMAZING! I have referred all of my friends and family to him and will happily sing his praises anytime someone has had a bad experience at a salon.  SEE KYLE. HE IS AMAZING. You'll thank me for the referral.",2

I went in here for some sort of lunch item because I couldn't find a parking spot at Panera. I was hoping Publix was like Harris Teeter and had a salad bar.  Nope, they do not, or at least it was not where I would expect it.  

What they do have is a deli that creates custom sandwiches which are extremely popular as the line was 25 deep and they were lined up through the deli area so if you wanted to see if they had premade sandwiches you had to fight through all the people.  

Finally found SMALL pre-made sandwiches and side salads.But it was so crowded that I could not see if they had any condiments for my sandwich.  At this point I was thoroughly annoyed and just wanted to get out of there.  But NOoooooo. Couldn't get out that easy. Then I get stuck behind people who want to walk 3 wide and hog and entire aisle and walk as slow as possible.

Honestly the Bi-lo that was here before was more organized for the deli area.  Their sandwich and hot food bar was right in front which made more sense.

What saved this from being a 2-star review is the customer service up front. Somebody was waiting for me and took me right away. Yay and she and the bagger were very friendly and helpful.  Thanks for the Publix reusable bag too. I only had 2 items though so it seemed like a waste.

So far Publix, I am not a fan but I only came here for a QUICK in and out for lunch. I probably will not be a regular here because it's not close to home but they are building a Publix near me so there is still hope. And if I do come back, I'll remember to take a late lunch.",2

Wi-fi was included, which was one of the main reasons why I chose this hotel, but it was very spotty.

Unfortunately, this was a known problem by the staff, but I guess nothing could have been done about it.

I love Bouchon!
I had dinner here while visiting Vegas in 2010 and came back recently now that I live in Vegas and dinner was excellent both visits.
Bouchon is my favorite french fine dining on the strip so far.
Can't wait to go back.
I'm a fan of their salmon spread (not sure on the name, I ask just for it) and their lamb :) save room for dessert! I love their chocolate filled mini donuts.
Make reservations! If you're not drinking alcohol dinner for 2 should be around $125

17464,3,1550534400000,"I had to end my long love affair with TMobile this week. We were together for 11 years. No fights, no lying, no cheating...just love. It was a perfect romance and definitely one of the saddest break ups. I will be back, someday. 

My mom bought me an iPhone for Christmas with an upgrade she had on her account. My plan was to unlock it and use it with TMobile. That was until my mom called and told me I would be forced to use ATT because she was being charged for an extra plan. Cue the tears.

It felt like an arranged marriage. I didn't want to leave my Tmobile boyfriend that I loved. But I had to suck it up and marry ATT for the time being. I don't think it will be long, I figure once I blow through my moms roll over minutes in the next few months I will be able to unlock my iphone and switch back to Tmobile.

so far i've been with ATT for a few days and these are the major differences i've noticed and believe Tmobile is far better:

1. price- with tmobile I had unlimited data, minutes, and texts all for under $90/mo after taxes. to get the same plan at ATT i would have to pay about $30 more a month and then it's not even unlimited data. Thankfully I'm on my moms account and they have like 10k rollovers so I don't need an unlimited plan. 
2. getting ahold of a person- 611 and option 0 and you would immediately be connected to a human. with ATT they make you do a bunch of crazy options and then they put you on hold. I sat on hold several times and then it would just hang up on me. when i finally got ahold of ATT people some of the offices were closed....which brings me to
3. does tmobile ever close? ok they do at like 1am and that's amazing! there are a couple hours in the wee night you have to do without. go to bed! 
4. when you're on hold with tmobile they play soft music. ATT uses that time to try and sell you crap. it's the last thing i want to hear when i'm waiting on hold. it's like being held hostage because they know you have to listen. tacky, i say. 
5. customer service- att customer service hasn't been bad, but tmobile has that little pep in the step. 
6. i never lost service or dropped calls with tmobile. but i have a few times already with ATT :(
7. ATT messed up the porting of my old number so right now  i have some random temporary number until they can fix it. 

i could keep going but i will it stop there. i love tmobile and i can't wait to be re-united.",2
17469,2,1551052800000,"I've been here about 10 times now, and out of all of those visits, only 1 has been up to my standards. I had written this place off after the first time, but they sent a flyer out in the mail and I decided to give it another go since I needed to get my car washed and detailed anyway.

When I got there, they were trying to sell me on a monthly package, and the idea wasn't unappealing since I like to keep my car immaculate. I just remember that during my last wash they had missed so many things on the inside, and was reluctant to commit to them since I had already found another place that did a perfect job.

The guy that I was speaking to asked me what was missed the last time and I went over the long list. He talked to the guys who were currently detailing my car, and by the time I got it back, everything was done just right. So I signed up for the monthly ($35/mo) because I thought it had improved.

Two months later and every time I go, the windows are wiped- but streaky. Whenever I drive at night you can tell and it's so obnoxious. Simple things are missed, like the metal detailing on my steering wheel which always has smudges on it after they turn my car over to me again. The space between the seats isn't vacuumed. My sunroof always looks awful. I'm going to cancel the monthly and return to my other detailing guys at Tivoli Village (have your car detailed while you're having lunch).

Their hours aren't correct as they close at 4:30 I believe. And I've skipped getting my car washed twice because the line was too long.",2

17478,2,1549238400000,"Last Tuesday I took advantage of the Chevrolet ""Sign and Drive"" promotion to buy a 2013 Chevy Camaro from Findlay Chevrolet in Las Vegas. Although my primary residence is in Arizona, over the past couple of years I have found myself working in Las Vegas so much that my car rental expenses have come in at well over $600 a month on average,  So I decided to contact somebody I know that works at Findlay Chevrolet and see what kind of deal I could get. After several text messages, I drove out to the dealership and met with my friend, Jamaal McCoy who is the dealership GM. I met Jamaal at an industry event in Miami a couple years ago and we have stayed in contact since. Jamaal asked me to work with a salesman at the dealership by the name of ""Larry"". Larry was fairly new, but was exceptionally helpful and pulled up 3 2013 Chevy Camaros in different colors that met my equipment requirements... Right away i knew that I wanted the black one... very good looking car! When Jamaal presented the deal to me, including trading in a 2006 Mercury Mariner that I needed to dispose of for a relative that lives in Las Vegas, I was VERY pleasantly surprised. The monthly payments with no money down, and negative equity of about $1,200 in my trade-in came out to less than $375 a month. I smiled, accepted the deal and thanked Jamaal for his courteous treatment and better than expected numbers. After going through the documentation process, getting our complimentary accessories from their accessory department, a Findlay Chevy employee who specializes in doing vehicle deliveries took me through all the new Camaro's systems, Bluetooth set up with my phone and made sure I knew how to operate the vehicle... Away we went, in one of the smoothest and most aggravation free new car buying experiences I have ever had.

9/7/13 UPDATE: I dropped my 2013 Camaro off in the Findlay Chevrolet Service Department on July 18th for a routine 8,000 mile service and then went on a business trip to Washington DC... While in DC I was hospitalized and did not return to Las Vegas until September 4th. My biz associate called ""Slim"" my Service Advisor at Findlay and explained I was not going to be back for awhile due to a medical emergency. Slim stored my car for over 6 weeks and when I picked it up, they had washed and vacuumed it, as well as not charging me for the service or the storage in their secured lot. The only thing I paid for was an extra key, which was over $200 due to the key Fob security system and the programming required.  All in all, this is one of the best dealerships I have ever bought a car from and had one serviced at. If you are in the market for a new or used car, or need your GM vehicle services, I highly recommend Slim and heather in Service and Jamaal (GM) will set you up with the right deal in the sales department.  They even have a shuttle service to take you to home or business while your vehicle is being serviced, and then will pick you up when it is done.  I wish more businesses of all types had the customer focus that Findlay Chevrolet has.",3

For us it sounded like a can't miss with three of our favorite films by director Baz Luhrmann; my wife's all time fav of his Romeo + Juliet, for me it was all about Moulin Rouge, and then we both thoroughly enjoyed The Great Gatsby. 

First, I love the layout for the theater. It has stage areas just prior to the rising seating. These mini stages are utilized throughout the performances as the actors come through the audience. The subtle mini projections on the sides of theater are a nice touch to build setting without a number of props since you are traveling between Verona, Paris, and New York. 

Second, we were both so impressed with energy of the cast. As they moved from place to place they were always running and there was chatter ""in character"" the whole time, so much to do and remember. 

Before the show our main curator of the story walked among the guest, took pictures, no words, just engaging with people. The female leads for the show, steal the show, the males do a good job in support, but hands down the ladies owned the night. 

The show does a great job blending the stories and even mixing the soundtracks together to fit into the other story lines; as they all deal with love and loss, it works. It had us breaking out the old soundtracks when we got back to the hotel room.

The absolute best tacos I have ever had where at my finger tips in Tijuana or could even be found at Tacos El Gordo in SD. That being said this is the number 1 spot I have found for tacos that can match my home town taco level. 
The meat is prepared fresh from the in house carnicería and this is the only place I have found in Phoenix that uses a trompo/ spit to roast their al pastor. This is a huge litmus test for authenticity in my book because if the meat is not prepared correctly it turned into nuggety chili covered dog food that is passed off as al pastor. That is 100%not the case here. They have the finest meat cooked whole and chopped to order. 
All tacos come with onion, cilantro, and salsa but gauc can be found inside at a salsa bar. You can treat yourself to as much as you want with no extra charge something I believe should never be a premium at any taco shop.

17663,2,1549238400000,"Typical super busy apple store with employees just standing around not doing anything.  We went midday on a Saturday after being unable to reserve a time online.  We were greeted at the door and told to go wait in a long line with one employee working to check people into a queue.  One person was literally checking people in.  Not helping fix problems or anything, just putting your name on a list.  This one person was dealing with a line of about 15 customers while more than 6 other apple employees stood around.  There were a few other employees working, but literally 6+ were just standing around chatting with each other.  When I incredulously inquired about this with our greeter he paged to have someone else come check people in, which was appreciated.   Once we were checked in it was a 2 hour wait to return and check into ANOTHER line, see a service person, and finally an hour wait to have the screen actually fixed.  The whole ordeal took the better part of the afternoon.  It seems like for all the streamlining and user friendly-ness that apple boasts this place could be much better managed.  I know the delays are pretty standard for apple stores, but literally through this whole process at any given time there were 6+ people standing around.  Either they should pony up and help with the genius bar flow or there should be just more technicians and less floor staff.",2

17743,3,1550966400000,"OK, this place has taught me one thing.  When you eat at a restaurant, stick with their specialty.

Started with the onion rings.  They looked half way in between hand made and machine made.  Served with ranch dressing that tasted like half ranch and half tartar sauce.  Sauce was tasty, but I ate half of my rings with ketchup.  (have i used the word half enough times yet?). We both ordered the 10 oz striploin steak special.  Why?  Because it was on special, duh!!  

Steak was fairly thin, and had a lot of fat in the cut. It was ok, but not what a good steak should taste like.  So back to the lesson, i should have stuck with the diner food that they specialize in.  My friend noted, that the steak wasn't that good, but it tasted exactly how he expected it to.

Dessert.  Friend said ""Sky High Lemon Meringue"" was good. I had the Hot Fudge Brownie Binge. WOW. Warm moist brownie topped with both ice cream and whipped cream and hot chocolate fudge. Amazing.  Too bad I had ordered so much food that i could not finish it.  Leaving leftover dessert should be a sin!!


Closing thoughts: If I based this on the steak it would be 2 stars.  If it was based on the dessert it would be 5.  If i come back here i will order something small off the ""diner portion"" of the menu, and re-order the brownie binge for desert ... even if i came for breakfast.",2

And since parking in Vegas is free...

They have a casino and spa in-house, as well as a bowling alley and a movie theater! Great for when you have downtime and want to do something a little more family friendly. 

The rooms were clean and plenty spacious, and the bathrooms were neat (with plenty of towels!!). I'm pretty simple about my hotel requests: clean, tidy, and not too cramped. This hotel fits the bill.

Also, the casino tables here are much cheaper to play at than anywhere else (think $5 buy-ins), so this is a great training ground for new players.",2

Our party was in the upstairs loft area of the building and it was quite spacious. There was tons of room for everyone to mingle, admire the art and enjoy the band that was playing. My only complaint was the temperature was a bit hot and there wasn't much ventilation.

The mutton and basmati rice were extremely dry. The mutton was tasteless. The palak paneer was without a doubt the worst. It was nothing more than puree spinach.

We went on a Saturday night right in the middle of the dinner rush, line  out the door but were seated pretty quickly and served even faster.   We had the most helpful Japanese waitress ever.  She helped us wade through the huge menu and made suggestions that turned out to be spot on!  A real sweetheart that we will ask for again next time.

Their ginger salad dressing and miso soup was very tasty.  I know others have complained about portion size and how big the rolls are but we were really hungry and didn't have any problem making them fit our mouths. (they are big but that's ok!)

Both of us noticed how fresh and tasty the rice was and the seaweed wraps not tough like we've found at other establishments.

We live just a few short blocks from SumoBoy in Mentor and while Pacific East is over a 30 minute drive, it's going to be our new favorite sushi spot.

Now for the food.  This was probably the one of the worst Korean foods I've eaten in Las Vegas.  I didn't try the Hawaiian food or the Sushi so I can't comment on that.  I very rarely give out a really bad rating.  However, the food didn't taste authentic at all.  The banchan didn't taste right, all of them.  Kimchi is different since people have a different preference on how sour or fresh they like it.  However, the other side dishes just did not satisfy me.   The Soon Tofu was bland with a lot of spices.  The Mandoo Guk (Dumpling soup) didn't have any seasoning.   I'm pretty lenient on Korean food in Las Vegas, but this isn't one I could be lenient on.

I would make the extra ten minute drive to the pho places in the ghetto just for better service and better pho.

Lately, I've given them another chance.  Their service has been more than excellent.  I've been there three times within the past month since I've decided to give them another chance.  2/3 times, I ordered food that was delicious (both bun bo hue).  3/3 times the service was quick, polite, and attentive to the table's needs.

They've come a long way with service and food quality from when I quit eating there four years ago.

The restaurant itself is clean and the seating is very spacious.  They have a full service bar and it's quiet there for the most part.

If you asked me four years ago to recommend a pho place, I would immediately tell people to go to Central Avenue or I'd offer to make it.  Now, if you're looking for a good pho place in the university area, I would recommend pho real.

17910,2,1549238400000,"I flew all the way from Florida for an outpatient test and eventually surgery and I was very pleased with my care.

95% of the staff I interacted really made me feel like they care about their job and the patients and families they help. I had been through this surgery before at another hospital in Florida and was placed in the ICU for my recovery - I got the same level of care on the regular hospital floor here, no ICU classification needed.

The campus can be a bit confusing at first, but everyone (in a red coat or not) is there to help you get around. There are a good amount of amenities for patients and their families - just wish there were some more comfy waiting areas (some of those chairs are killers on the back of your knees and the backs are very low).

My only real complaint was that with so many out of town patients they're not very helpful in arranging travel and help for those of us from elsewhere. I had a rough time contacting the travel concierge, as the concierge number listed in my paperwork was the medical concierge and she never answered my voicemails to tell me I was contacting the wrong department. Therefore, I was left to my own devices to arrange my flights, lodging, and transportation to the hospital until I finally got to campus where I found the real concierge desk and got some help. 

I wish there were more affordable hotels nearby with shuttles to campus - for my test I had to stay at a $130/night Holiday Inn Express downtown and use the HealthLine to get to/from campus, which isn't ideal travel for someone who just went through a complex medical test. Luckily when I went in for my surgery and had a family member fly up to be with me, I found a much cheaper, closer hotel on my own that had an independent shuttle to take us to/from campus. 

Their MyChart system is pretty good, a bit slow on updating test results, but not too bad. Very efficient on appointments.

Probably the best thing about the hospital is the direct care from the staff, all my nurses and physician assistants were just a phone cal away as I prepared for my trip and treatment. My doctors visited me daily to see how I did and keep me updated on my progress. Everyone was dedicated to attending to my every concern, almost too much, lol.

I think it was the cheese sauce. Just wasn't working for me. 

Ordered wings ""crispy and plain"", with a side of sweet chili. Delicious!!! Loved them! Just the right amount of sweet with a little kick. Asked to try sriracha sauce for a little more heat but didn't love it. Didn't seem any hotter than sweet chili. 

Anthony asked if I liked spin dip and since I didn't, he removed it from my bill. I said he didn't have to, but he insisted. That was very cool of him. 

Wanted to give this place a 3 star so bad due to the OBNOXIOUS child sitting at the table next to me, but that's not the restaurant's fault. It nearly ruined my dinner.

Overall, a good experience and certainly worth the 4 stars I gave it.  Would have been much better without the whiny child. I sat in bar area so the family with young children was not expected.

It was my birthday and I thought lets go some place that has a lot to do. I was expecting to do some mini golf, a movie and bowl. However, when I got there I was told the mini golf was closed. I wish they would have said something on their website because I wouldn't have driven all that way just to bowl and see a movie. I could have done that right next to my house. But since I was already there I thought why not. So I got to Fat Cats at around 730pm and decided to bowl first because the movie wasn't until 9pm. I paid $38 for 2 people for 1 hour of bowling (which I ended up only playing 1 full game). I found out about 10 mins later that if I had came at 9pm the bowling would have been only $8.99 per person including shoes (about $18 off the price I paid). I wish the person at the register told me this info. cause I would have left and went to eat at a nice restaurant then came back at 9pm. I thought by not telling me that was shady thing to do to try to make more money off of me. Anyway, I ended up getting some food and 1 Blue Moon. I also found out right after I ordered that the beer would have been $3 compared to the $7 I paid if I bought it after 9pm. No one at this place likes to inform their customers about their specials and I think that is horrible!!! I tried to save the evening by saving a half off the movies because if you buy food and a drink it's $5 a ticket, but there's a catch which no one tells you about. You have to buy your food from the restaurant that is in the same building but not apart of Fat Cats. So, instead of paying $10 for tickets it was $20.

In total a night that should have cost only $50 ended up costing over $100 for 2 people. 

I think the place was great that's why the 1 star, but the hiding of their specials and not telling me about them at the register is very WRONG!!!!

Only come to Fat Cats after 9pm that is my recommendation. It is not worth it any other time. 

This place ruined my birthday and I will never be back again!!!


Update: 

I got contacted by Bob Short, the General Manager of Fat Cats after I wrote this review. He asked me how he could make me feel better about my experience at Fat Cats and I said the only way I would be happy is if I got my money refunded and he did that. The credit card processing for the refund was taking too long so he offered to send a check in the mail. I received it yesterday.

I am very appreciative and thankful that Fat Cats would go out of their way to make me satisfied. This is what customer service should be like. 

Now I will return to Fat Cats (that's if I ever drive back to that area), but still only when the deals are going on. 

Thank you again Mr. Short for being so nice about everything.",2

C'mon, $16 for a 2 hour concert of Debussy? It's almost too good to be true. 

For those unfamiliar with Tsoundcheck, this a program for 18-35 year olds, where you can purchase set tickets (normally on Wednesday nights) for only $16. My friend and I got almost front row mezzanine tickets even with Tsoundcheck. 

In general, I would say that the TSO has really great mastery of the pieces. The symphony's forte (yes, pun intended) is definitely their technical skills. Peter Oundjian, the current conductor, certainly has a lot of charisma, sophisticated musicianship and all-in-all great artistic skill. He does a really great job making sure all the musicians are well integrated, yet each instrument stands out. 

I am also a fan of their program. They do a stylized breakdown of all the movements of the symphony. It's quite fun to go through while listening to the performance. 

I would also give a thumbs up to the location of TSO. It's conveniently located next to the Ritz Carlton, Shangri-La and all the bars on King West, perfect venues for some post-concert/pre-concert drinks. 

I am also considering joining the Impresarios Club at the TSO where members meet other young professionals in Toronto and bond over our shared passion for classical music. If anyone is in the club and would like to comment on it, that would be great.",2

After I explained what had been done at Midas, Marco seemed doubtful and offered to have a look at the system.  Given this is an older car, I asked him to look at a few other issues so that I could make a decision as to whether to proceed with the repair of the air conditioning system.   Marco advised there was a $50 fee for going over the car, and the process would take about an hour.

Within a few minutes, Marco and his technicians found a small electrical issue with the air conditioning and also found it was out of Freon, even though Midas had claimed to have charged the system and added dye which was supposed to have been included in the Groupon ""deal"".  Once recharged the air conditioning worked perfectly!  

The technicians completed going over the rest of the car and found the cause of the issues I noticed which again were nothing major.

18153,2,1550016000000,"I am actually giving Boston's a 2.5 Star rating here, let me tell you why.  While the food isn't the best I've had, its pretty darn good and its reasonably priced.  The atmosphere is good and its usually not that busy.

The one consistent problem I have here, is the service.  They are slow and half the times I've been there it seems as if they forget they have tables to service.  

I sat in the bar a couple of Friday's ago at about 6 pm while waiting for some friends.  I grabbed a booth (it was seat yourself) and three different waitresses walked by my table multiple times without acknowledging me.  Once my friends arrived, our waitress promptly asked if we had been served yet and took our orders.  Our food was good, but slow to come out.  Our drinks were cold, but slow to be refilled.

Come on Boston's!!!!! You can do better than this!

Can recommend the Tuna Sandwich with pecans and diced jicama...this was very nice with a side of the white bean salad. The highlight of this meal was definitely the roasted chicken, leek and mushroom crepes in a creamy basil sauce! Wow!

You can't go wrong with anything in their menu, but you have to try the hot peppers on the side.  They are fresh made and delicious as hell!  Plus you can buy a big jar of it if ya want.  I've tried a few different soups and they are all fresh, hot and delicious.  The broccoli and cheese is among the best I've tried.

I am addicted to THE WRECK, so good.  Meat is generous portions, fresh, and seasoned well.  Get bacon.  Extra bacon if you can.  It's really good here.  The Italian is also near perfection.  Load up on veggies here!.. Nice and fresh and tasty!

Nice ambience, plenty of seating options (tall tables, inside/outside, etc), and good customer service.  This is one of my favorite lunch spots.

18165,2,1549238400000,"I wanted to try this place out because my friend said it was cheap and pitchers were a good price. So I went to check it out for first time with my husband. I ordered a half pint of sapporo and pint of sangria. The waiter with glasses was nice but the female waitress came over our table and without a word took our menus away very fast and she even cut her eye at me! I have never felt so insulted at a restaurant before it was like she didn't care if we were there at all because by the looks of it it was a full house and they get a lot of young students on a tight budget. She was unfriendly, I dont expect overly friendliness but the eye cutting was not cool. 
I had sapporo  at another place that day so when I tasted the sapporo it was watered down. I didnt know that its even possible or legal. I know the taste of sapporo, but this tasted funny, bland and watered down. Sangria was not sangria, its a fruit punch full of orange juice and sprite.  I think sangria should be mostly wine and fruits, top it off with some sprite but this sangria tasted like fruit punch juice, not much wine.

It was busy and only two servers for such a Huge place...they were very unstaffed. Waiter was literally running from one end to another. If you're that busy you can afford more than 2 staffs on a busy night so paying customers and tipping customers can have the service they deserve.

to be honest I really liked the brie and avocado sandwich it was good and tasty. When it comes to food im very easy so it was decent for me. 

Overall brie sandwich was good, sapporo pint watered down and not good. I wouldnt recommend this place, I can get legit beers on tap for a lot cheaper at other places.  Im not going to throw my money away because the price on menu is low, when in fact im not getting what im paying for, and quality is low; water down beer is watered down and is illegal.",2

18181,3,1549324800000,"So as my regular dinner plans got screwed up tonight, a few friends and I opted to check out Kings Kitchen.

The positives:  Very friendly staff, the purpose of the restaurant is wonderful, the collard greens are amazing, decent wine selection, and the willingness of the management to talk to you about things not working with your meal.  

The not-so positives:  

Spare ribs should be tender where they should be easy to pick off the bone.  These were very tough and I was fighting with them with the butter knife.  At least serve them with a better knife.  

Water glasses were only refilled for some of the people at our table...seemed to be the pretty ones; the banana pudding - while the claim is it is the signature dessert - it was a bit runny and didn't seem to be set long enough.

I was disappointed with the ribs.  The waiter asked my truthful opinion and I told him.  He said it was taken care of and the manager came over and talked to me about it as well.  I appreciate this and the purpose of this restaurant and in order to make things right, the staff needs to know about these flaws.",2

My gf and I sat at the bar, towards the end where the Chef was calling out orders and prepping/overseeing each plate as they left the kitchen. The wait staff quickly took our orders, coats, and provided a few recommendations (drinks came within 2 minutes). We went with the seared scallops and fois gras to start and then was intrigued by the lamb preparation the Chef was putting together, which we of course ordered immediately.

This locations seems to have a large selection of sweaters, blouses and denim. I was surprised at how much merchandise they packed into each rack.

It was almost overwhelming, but I guess it makes sense to have tons of merchandise since Christmas is around the corner.

I bought about 8 pairs of jeans and trousers for about $120, which I thought was a great deal.

18245,3,1551225600000,"This is my second time ordering from this Port of Subs through the online portal and my second time being served late. The first time happened during a lunch rush, and the store will filled with people, and the staff was all clearly busy and working frantically to keep up with the number of customers, so I don't fault them for letting my online order fall through the cracks, that's to be expected.

This time, however, my order sat forgotten off to the side while several of the staff were idling, there were only three to five people in line for sandwiches, some of who were already being assisted. When I came to pick up the order around 15 minutes past when the order was scheduled to be ready for pickup, I was surprised to find that while the store was empty, my order had yet to be started. Most of the staff just asked each other where my order was on the assumption that was done, but upon realizing that it hadn't, I was asked to move so that the other customers could access the register. They didn't tell me that they hadn't started on my sandwiches yet, why they hadn't started on them, nor did they apologize for making me wait on my advance online order.

When my order was done, there was a mixup and they put someone else's sandwich in my bag, and when they tried to sort it out, the sandwiches were not labeled and it wasn't clear whose was whose. They packed my bag with my two sandwiches and handed it back to me, after having me pay ahead of time. When I received my bag, I asked about the cookie I'd ordered, which they didn't put in the bag. The lady working the register flat out told me that I hadn't ordered a cookie, without even checking my order. I asked her if she was sure, and she again told me that I hadn't ordered one, again without checking. I told her that I was pretty sure I ordered one, and asked if she could check the order sheet, which was on the counter right next to her. Once she'd bothered to look down at the piece of paper, she verified that did, and told me that it was ok to take a cookie. I was pretty taken aback at how bad service was, no effort was made to apologize or explain why things were so bad, just here's your late food, with the wrong order, goodbye.

Late service, bad service, messed up orders, I don't think I'll be coming here anymore.

It's not like it's hard to find alternatives. If you're looking for a sandwich in the area, go a little bit east and you'll find the Full Belly Deli, with great food and service. There's a Quiznos a little bit further east of that. If you go west down Deer Valley instead, you'll hit a Subway before you get to the freeway. If you head north, you can eat at the City Square Deli instead, which also has great sandwiches and great service. Further north, you can find a Jersey Mike's in the plaza along Happy Valley Rd. Literally any of these places will serve you sandwiches of equal or better quality without the unacceptably terrible service.

EDIT: I had a long and busy day and it wasn't until late afternoon until I finally had the time to eat my sandwich. I unwrapped it to find that it was the wrong sandwich. The same person who had not checked the piece of paper next to her to see if I'd actually ordered a cookie had not bothered to check when she put the wrong, unlabeled sandwich in my bag. It would've taken a few seconds to open the wrapping and peek in and rewrap it, but apparently that was too much to ask for. The sandwich I ordered had double meat and avocado added, so I just got swindled out of several bucks. I will certainly never be coming back.",2

When I mentioned to Holly that my right hand nails were not shiny, she told me it was because of the lotion on them.  I already washed my hands with soap and they looked cloudy.  Holly was not friendly and would yank my hand aggressively throughout my mani.  She yelled at me for taking the foils off my fingers when they were trying to soak the previous gels off.  They were incubating for over 20 minutes and were starting to heat up my fingers.  The salon is not clean.  There was an employee's child there that wouldn't stop talking to customers.

Perhaps this was because all the table games are now automated (from what I hear, there WERE live dealers here at one point), and the Blackjack/Poker tables are manned by an array of creepy pre-taped video dealerettes. Or maybe it's because the cocktails are watered down even by ""free drinks at a cheap casino"" standards. 

Still, aside from the emptiness (and a couple of scary hobos continuously declaring their love for anal intercourse), this is an all-right spot to spend minimal money in maximum time. The $1 Blackjack table kept me entertained for a good while, and I only ended up $5 in the hole.

The room was clean.  The TV worked.

Do they really think I am going to fork over $2500 without questions and how was I going to trace that back; how did I know I hadn't already paid it?   It's not my personal policy to not pay my bills for two years. I sent them an email wondering why I should  believe I owe them $$$$ when two years had gone by, not to mention damage to my credit and interest accrued.  So two days later I get a call that oops, your bill is actually $0.  I have wasted a load of time trying to get this straightened out.  I called back requesting they send me something in writing to share with their collection agency and suggested they clean up their act.  The woman I talked to was indignant and rude and I didn't even get an apology until my ranting reached a fever pitch.  

My advice:  If these guys are working for you make sure you hold onto every piece of paper they send you. Make a copy of your check. Set it aside in a separate envelope and file it under the taxes for the year of your procedure in case they decide they want to pad their billings in two years.",2

Really, I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.

I live near here, and most nights the music is blaring out their front door until midnight or later. Drunken patrons stumble around the parking lot, sometimes with drinks in their hands. I've personally witnessed a few using the parking lot as their bathroom. I've seen cases of beer being ferried to an adjacent parking lot and surreptitiously placed in the trunks of waiting cars.

And so I just wanted to see if the crappy neighbors actually serve decent food.

We were pleasantly surprised to see a full service restaurant inside the museum, as we were expecting nothing more than a food counter.  The restaurant is beautiful, and overlooks the museums courtyard.  It helps that it was a beautiful day, but the scenery in the courtyard made the experience more enjoyable.  Our server was helpful and attentive, and the food was delicious.  I had a chicken sandwich with a cup of soup. The sandwich was excellent; flavorful and not dried out.  The soup was good as well (maybe I'm nit-picking, but it needed a touch of salt).  The only thing I would knock this place for is the menu.  It's good, but not much variety. Obviously not a big deal, though, as I was able to find something I liked on the menu and enjoyed it very much.

I had heard wonderful things about the GVR's pool, spa, and overall experience. Was I shocked and disappointed at the service we received! I called GVR to make my reservation using the zoohotel.com price quote which included free drinks and some other items. Upon my arrival at the front desk check-in, the receptionist seemed to question my purchase and did not give me any of the items or free perks listed when I made my reservation. The receptionist was unfriendly and not helpful.

Our room was clean. The service at the spa was some of the friendliest service we experienced throughout our stay. On the flipside, the server at the pool was extremely slow and the food that was brought out to us was cold.  Poor service may make more sense during a busy time, but we were there on a nearly empty weekday! 

To top it off, as a local, I was excited to see the staff wearing ""I Love Local"" pins but was extremely disappointed when I asked what the local benefits were - the woman at check-in brushed it off my question and gave me a weird look for even asking. Apparently, they just wear the button, there is no preferential or discounts for locals. 

The whole experience was such a disappointment! And it was an embarrassment for me with how much I had talked up GVR to my visiting sister.  Bummed out!! And will NOT be going back.",1

let's start w/the positives;
Ron y piña as a cocktail....so tasty fresh pineapple, rum, lime and chili y salted rim which I love and you can also taste a light pineapple pulp.

For dinner I ordered the rice which was super interesting & had bits of veggies like mushrooms mmmmm. I bet it's their paella rice, it's a lil crispy and chewy and has some nice flavoring. I really could jus come and eat a million bowls of rice. 

taco chinos are pretty bomb, so hearty and unique. They have this Vietnamese style thing going on. I know this is jus wrong to say but I would use less meat and add maybe carrots or a little bean sprt to give it an ump. But really that is minor. 

my hang ups;
I tried to order pork belly tacos but they were out and no chips and salsa which for me is blasphemy.

cochitia taco. was totally thrown off by the flour taco and I feel some sort of way for paying $4 for 1 taco, it was good but not impactful.

I will now tell you of my first and last experience using a credit card with these people.... In a financial climate where there is so much fraud and much of it coming from credit card information being obtained through unnecessary means, I feel the need to publicize the practices of the Lorain location of Nunzio Pizza. Last night 3/25/13, I called to place an order. When I told them that I was paying by CC they asked for the usual info, name number, expiration. Then it got a bit strange. The woman taking the order asked if my billing address was the same as the address I provided for delivery. Then she asked for the 3 digit code on the back of the card. Then when the delivery man arrived, he, without my permission, attempted to take an imprint of my credit card as well after having already checked it against my photo ID. I have not ever needed to provide such a large amount of information for a simple pizza order.

The wings came with 7-8 decent size pieces, but I found the breading was a bit too crunchy and the sauce didn't taste quite right. The schnitzel sandwich was okay, the actual meat was kind of small, and there was too much onion. Also the ""fries"" were just chunks of potato without much flavor.

I ordered a rice bowl with chicken, along with a side of falafel and hummus. 

The good:  Falafel and hummus was really good. Both tasted fresh and get my two thumbs up. The pita bread that comes with the orders was also very good.  Fluffy and tasty.

The bad:  The basmati rice tasted undone. The rice was still hard. The flavoring on the rice was also underwhelming. I love rice in general...this rice was not good. The chicken needed more seasoning.  Didnt taste any different from bland chicken you could buy at fast food joint.  The sauce options were just eh.  Neither of the two (mango and tahini) made the rice bowl taste any better.

BBQ pork rice noodle roll with green onion (4/5)
The rice noodle is smooth and chewy though a little bit thick to my standard. There are quite a lot of BBQ pork inside the rice noodle but I can't find any green onion though.

bean curb skin with mushrooms and chinese herbs roll (3/5)
It looks good and is stuffed with a lot of vegetables but a bit too salty. 

 shrimp dumplings (4.5/5)
This is good and delicious. The only drawback is the wrap is a bit thick to my standard.

deep fried savoury glutinous dumpling (4/5)

I went here two times while posing as an East Ender and they were two contrasting experiences. A midnight excursion felt more like I was in a bar that Canadians would find to be a frustrating typical American experience. Boys were drinking too hard, sloshing their conversations and breaking glasses. While that midnight booth-ing was overall really nice, with attentive service, the music didn't match the sequence. Then, New Year's morning it was a casual, comfortable brunch scene. They had steak & eggs on the menu. And it wasn't a pan-griddle cheap cut, it was a filet. They have tea -- tea type tea, not cold tea -- so if you're not in the mood to drink you can still enjoy their expansive, indulgent menu. Breakfast poutine of tater tots drenched in duck fat gravy & bison belly. And I have a feeling there's a bouncer considering it's next to Jilly's. Sure it's off putting at first, but really that's likely a good idea with what's happening out on that corner. The only corner in my Canadian experience thus far that reminded me of the states.

18522,3,1550448000000,"A new AYCE conveyer belt sushi joint. It says at the bottom of their menu in small print that everyone in your party MUST order the same thing. Meaning if one person wants the additional AYCE Dungeness crab for an extra $6.00, everyone at that table will be charged an extra $6.00, just a heads up. 

Friends and I went during the Soft Opening late night to check it out. Location is meh, there's limited parking in the front of the joint and the place itself isn't super nice or fancy. However when you walk in most of the seating is bars-style with some booths on the side for larger parties. 

Since it was the soft opening I was not expecting TOO much from them. The conveyer belt had little labels that go around saying what sushi would be there. They barely had any though. You had to your waiter that you want freshwater eel or else you were gonna be waiting til forever lol. The selection of fish wasn't that much either. You got your regular salmon and tuna nigiris of course, mackerel, shrimp, yellowtail and freshwater eel is what I remembered going around yet there was barely any to take. But when you do request for certain foods from your waiter, he will either bring it to you or it gets delivered on the cute little train device that goes straight to your table on the conveyer belt. If you've ever been to Sapporo then you know what I'm talking about!

Aside from the fish, there were also entries you could order which includes the Dungeness crab. The crab was pretty good, not sure if I would pay extra $6 for it again though cuz it was a hassle cracking it open and getting little bit of meat. 

Service was ok. I asked them twice for a cup of ice for my can of coke and they forgot up until we were done eating. For the most part everyone was friendly and attentive when it came to picking up dirty plates.

I guess a suggestion for other customers would be to order online and pick it up yourself. It seems the delivery service and quality control for delivery is this location's downfall. The pizzas taste better from Pizza Hut than most other pizza restaurants and I would bet the ratings here would improve if delivery service could be managed better.",2

OMG!  How fantastic is it that Calgary has its own cream puff place now?!   These cream puffs are to die for.  Cruffs has multiple fillings to choose from.  Minis and regular size... minis are great, except that I end up having 3 in one sitting.  So maybe I should have had a regular sized one to have a proper ""fix"".  Next time I will have to get me some chocolate covered cream puffs too.  This place definitely knows what they are doing.

The manager didn't arrive until 10:10am, and then had to proceed to set up before she could start my nails! Very frustrating and unprofessional. On top of that She did a sloppy job and my nails look like crap. She didn't paint anywhere close to my cuticle, and you could tell the top coat jar was pretty empty (or out) and she never bothered getting a fresh one.

The bed was hard. We had to wait in line behind two women screaming about how rude the valets were when we checked in (nice first impression). Waited over an hour for an extra pillow I called for, but had to walk down to the front desk in the end or it was never coming; they had no record of my call.

Even the McDonalds in the lobby was horrible; Rude, slow and half our meal wound up in the trash because it was old and inedible. Though, I will say that the Plaza does not own them, so the quality of the crap we tried to eat was not their fault.

The dish was very good, but I have had paella in a number of places including Spain and was not the best, but I expect you maybe hard pressed to find better in.Pittsburg.

I say I just want an oil change and he says it will still be 37.99.  I then say well I think I'll just go somewhere else that's pretty expensive.  He says how about  $10 off and I agree.

They do their thing.  The guy brings me out to go over everything.  Your right lisence plate light is out do you want that fixed?  No.  Your wipers are looking pretty bad do you want us to replace those?  No.  We have this fuel cleaning blah blah?  No.  We tested your battery and you need a new batter.  How much is that?  $106.

I went through a really rough time and I had put on a lot of weight from being sedentary for so long because of the blood clots, as well as all of the medications I was on. I am 5' 11"" and a former model. I am used to everything fitting ok on me and this was a big shock to me, especially since I have been waiting for a day like this forever..When I got engaged I had picked out a beautiful Sherri Hill dress that fit perfect, since the health scare I put on probably 49 pounds in a quick 8 months. I am alive and healthy and that's the most important thing! Well my dress didn't fit after all of this. My wedding is April 23. I was panicked. I came across BridalXOXO on yelp and read the reviews. I went in and Ana and the rest of the crew made me feel like I was back in Italy again on the runways. She had me try on my dress (that now was 3 times too small for me) and with a few looks, tugs etc.  Knew exactly what to do for the dress and to complement my body now. I wanted to add some sleeves (long ones) and she suggested a cap sleeve instead, because the longer sleeve would make me look even bigger. She knows a woman's body and knows exactly how to flatter the figure. I didn't even flinch when she offered her advice because I felt so comfortable with her, and trusted her... And that's only meeting her for 5 min!  She took my dress and started the alterations. I even added on one of her handmade gorgeous veils instead of the one I had bought originally! I went yesterday for the second fitting , and omg.. she made the dress fit amazing!!! You would never know it was 3 sizes too small!! I'm in absolute awe of of amazing it looks! I feel like my old self again! I can't wait to post pictures of my actual wedding photos to show her gorgeous work! She is a miracle worker! And the family feel to her company makes everything even better. Anna and everyone at BridalXOXO saved my wedding! I am getting married in less than 30 days! I pick up the final product two days before the wedding! I can't wait! I can't thank you enough from the bottom of my heart! I suggest anyone who needs alterations, a custom made dress, veil etc to come here. You will not be disappointed! I have included a picture of my dress (not fully done yet. Sleeves need to be sewn on) where you can see Anna added a corset and the gorgeous veil I purchased from her. Once I have my wedding and pictures I will add more! Thank you again!! Grazie!!!!

Location is fantastic - convenient for anyone and any occasion.

The biggest complaint I have is the almost too common, TERRIBLY SLOW service.
I recently went to AB with a group of 6 people for lunch at 130pm. Mind you, lunch rush was over. Took a little too long to get seated because we had called ahead and made a reservation - still had to wait 10 minutes. 
After being seated, it took about 15 minutes for our beverages to arrive - sparkling water and lemonade ... really?!?!!? It was even worse when we ordered our food. Everyone ordered a salad, get this, it took a full 20 minutes for the salads to arrive in a half empty restaurant. AB should take notice and fix the problem.

It opened a few months back and received some good reviews so hubby and I stopped by to try for ourselves. For a tiny pretzel shop they had a a nice variety of things on the menu, including vegan-friendly options. 

When it comes to pretzels they offer the following:
Plain
Garlic
Jalapeno
Cinnamon Sugar
Pepperoni
Raisin
Sesame
Sweet Almond
Honey Whole Grain
Sour Cream and Onion

Pretzel Stix and Pretzel Nuggets come either salted or in cinnamon sugar. They also have Pretzel Dogs that come in sizes mini, regular and jumbo.

Dipping Sauces:
Cheese 
Melted Cheese 
Hot Salsa Cheese
Marinara
Caramel 
Sweet Mustard
Light Cream Cheese
Sweet Glaze

I ordered a ""Sour Cream and Onion"" and ""Jalapeno"" pretzel. They were priced at $3.49 each. I also ordered 2 melted cheese dips priced at 75 cents each. The cashier was very friendly and they had samples out on the counter. One thing I did like is the cashier asked if I wanted my pretzels salted or unsalted. I don't like salt on my pretzel and some places have it already on the pretzel and I get stuck picking it off, at least here I had the option to have it with or without. The sour cream and onion pretzel was just ok. It wasn't as soft and warm like I'm used to and it could have used more of the sour cream and onion on it. The jalapeno pretzel was pretty good, but again on the dry side. They weren't stingy with the jalapenos which was nice, but it seemed like the pretzel wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The melted cheese dip wasn't melted at all. I think she gave me the regular cheese dips instead. I didn't mind the regular cheese dip however the cheese being warm would have been more to my liking.

I like sandwiches. I hadn't really found a great sandwich place to go to- sometimes Melt is just so greasy, and nothing seems to compete with Zingermans where I spent many years.

After hearing so many good reviews from fellow yelpers, we went to Bogtrotters Doorstep tonight. Oh man, was it ever good.

First, it's kind of hard to find. ""1848 W. 25th"". Ummm. For the illiterate directionalist I am, I was rather confused when the address led me to Old Angle Tavern. I walked in and out a couple of times.... then called them. ""There's tables right outside my door"" said the voice on the other line (although he almost seemed annoyed), ""you mean the door with the dentists names outside?"" ""No, there's tables right outside""..and then I realized it was on Bridge instead. Oops.

Walked in, found my dinner partner waiting, and Nate greeted me with a smile (ok, may he wasn't annoyed). It's a cute hole in the wall place, right off of Old Angle- in fact, it shares a spot with Old Angle, so we were able to bring our food into Old Angle, enjoy the live music there, and eat our sandwiches.

Nate actually brought us our sandwiches as we sat in Old Angle (aww, how nice!). We both ordered ours ""wet"" and ""crunchy""- meaning, that the sandwich is dipped in au jus sauce and ""crunchy"" meaning that they put chips on it. Simple enough. He got the porkopolis- pork loin was good, and Nate even went the extra mile and put fresh greens on it (he said there was broccoli!)- just to be nice. Wow. He got an extra star in my book for that. I thought it was a tad salty though- but I guess all pork loins are salty.

My sandwich was GREATTTTTT. I got the Philly- roast beef, cheese sauce, onions, mushrooms, dipped in au jus.... omg, that was a GREAT GREAT sandwich. And yes, get it crunchy- the chips make it so good... it definitely reminded me of the cheesesteaks in Philly, where I just needed to order ""steak with wiz!"" Omg. YUM YUM YUM.

I'll be back to bogtrotters. It's a HUGE sandwich, so it's definitely worth it. Mmmm. Go go go. It's not the greasy sandwiches you'll find at other places- this is a sandwich with solid meat, and solid toppings, and it's served with great service. I approve. Nom nom x 10.",1

18829,2,1550707200000,"This is quite possibly the worst Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas.  No, it is the worst.

I am still pissed off 3 days later.  Funny thing is they didn't do anything wrong in particular - I just get pissed spending money on crappy food!

The menu had Limited menu choices - in other words the top ten Americanized Chinese dishes and that is it.

I ordered a garlic chicken.  Deep fried chicken nuggets in a sweet sauce with garlic.  Way to sweet, nothing savory in this dish, no balance, and the garlic didn't go with the sauce.  It was just a mess.

The menu prices were $12-$15 for less than average common Chinese food.  The teryaki chicken at my kids junior high tastes better!  The bill for 2 people was $37.  Not expensive , but for what you get it sucks!

What really rubbed my rhubarb the wrong way is there is a Panda Express in the food court.  The food at Panda Express is better (I do not say this lightly)!  We could have went to Panda and spent about $15 for 2 people and ate better!!

Damn it! I am getting more upset as I write this.",3

The pear tarts are my favourite. They are delicious, er tart and not too sweet. They also serve sandwiches, macaroon and coffee and its offshoots. Everything is fresh, tasty and with the price above average.
It is located in an odd place for a confectionary and café like this, but presumably either the couple and their children live nearby or it was a matter of real-estate.
The décor is rustic and tasteful. I like the whisk light fixtures and the very fashionable monkeys residing there...

18852,2,1550448000000,"The food here was just average. We ordered the fried chicken, fish tacos, prime dip Philly style and fried calamari. It wasn't bad, but just not that great; again just average.

The fried chicken batter wasn't very good and was too oily and the meat was a bit dry, especially the white meat. The coleslaw side was pretty good but the portion way too small for 4 pieces of chicken. 

The prime dip was pretty good but the meat portion was neither big nor small; sort of on the unsatisfying side though. The fries it came with were the giant cut, out of a plastic bag variety.

The fish tacos were nicely presented but bland as sliced bread. The side of salsa it came with was paltry and barely enough for one taco.

The calamari was good but maybe because it was the appetizer and we were all hungry, and the portion seemed fair. The marinara was typical but the pesto sauce was salty.  

For $40 including the tip, you can't complain too much about the price. But, our server was lukewarm, the ambiance funeral home quiet, and at the hour we went, 6pm, it was mostly elderly folks. 

There's a lot out there where 40 bucks can buy 3 people a very tasty meal in a lively if not interesting setting. At Lakes Lounge, the most interesting thing were the Sunday night football games on the multiple flat-screens and the locals hanging out at the bar playing video poker.

Unless you like a serving of suburban Vegas boredom cum mild depression with your average American meal, you can skip this place.",3

The Thursday special was $6 appetizers and so I ordered sliders and shrimp cocktail. My colleague ordered sliders and the Buffalo chicken wings.  The sliders were good, but my shrimp were clearly not fresh and very limp. However, the cocktail sauce more than made up for them. The flavor and the horseradish combination was perfect! BUT, the real highlight of the meal was the beer battered buffalo wings. These were strips of real chicken breast in an absolutely delicious beer batter coating. There was an enormous quantity of them and  unfortunately we were not able to finish them because there were so many.  I would gladly go back and have that appetizer plate as my sole meal.

I mean its cute for a dollar, but I feel as though cheated from advertising lol :( .
(minimum to print is 6)

Good thing is this place is open pretty late.  The ambiance and setup is cute.  
Plus when your photos are done printing they email you or text you so you can pick it up when your ready.

PRO TIP:
it is faster if you email the photos you want printed to the email given to you with your account.  If you want you can make an account @ home or whatever, email the photos you want printed to that account, login at the fotobar store, access your prints from ""my account"" and boom have it printed.

Today, we had the rendang, a beef dish with rice and a nice salad, as well as a beef satay that had very tender beef and a nice peanut sauce.

Once the two groups got back together it was pretty chaotic as the people in my group had no idea what was going on in the other room.  There was a lot of confusion about what was done and what was missing.  The theme itself was very interesting and the puzzles were creative and fun once we figured out what was going on.  however, I wished Lockquest did private bookings without having to have the maximum number of people.

18925,2,1549152000000,I only give 1 star because of the repeated deceptive pricing practices at this location. You should check every line item on your receipt before leaving the store as the point of sale will often not match the aisle pricing. They will also place for sale items of one size next to another brand or size that's slightly different and leave the price off the more expensive item not on sale. You'll think you are getting the sale item but it will ring up higher. We had so many mis-priced items requiring return trips to the store for refunds we no longer shop here. Harris Teeter is just across the road. Publix isn't worth the hassles. No way that many items are marked incorrectly without intention behind it. Spend your dollars elsewhere.,2

Brunch at Bouchon. Saturday, 1:15 pm, there was hardly a wait. We shared: 

-- chicken & waffles ($25): fancier & pricier, but in terms of taste, does not hold a candle to my beloved Roscoe's (yes, I said it & I'm not ashamed!) The two components tasted like two separate dishes on one plate. The roasted chicken was delicious w/ the gravy & the bacon-chive waffle was good w/ the maple syrup, but put it all together & it was just a hot mess; it didn't belong together. I didn't know if I was eating breakfast or dinner. I did not dig TK's version of chicken & waffles. 
-- corned beef hash ($18): i like how they used cubes of corned beef instead of shredded corned beef; it matched the size & shape of the potatoes. A little greasy, but very flavorful & hearty. Topped with an egg (I chose soft scrambled.)
-- tartine au thon ($17, tuna): open-face sandwich, tuna was very lemony. I'm not a tuna fan, but my taste buds agreed with this dish. Fries were crispy & well salted.

Foodies (I don't consider myself to be one) put Bouchon & Thomas Keller on a pedestal, but honestly, I've had much better brunch food elsewhere.",2

For those who are always indecisive with decisions, Bahama Breeze's menu may be hard for you to choose just one thing to order. I was in between a couple dishes but in the end, I went for something healthy: a shrimp rice bowl with grilled/sauteed veggies. Portions were on point for lunch. It was just the right amount to fill me up without that ""ugh, I feel so fat and bloated"" feeling. However, I DO get full easily though so hmm... My boyfriend got the Caribbean jerk chicken pasta.

Environment- this place made me feel so at home! Random & cute toys at the bar, plush vegetables sitting against the chairs, bookcases filled with manga, and Japanese curtains covering the windows that made me feel like I was in someone's home in Japan. Something about it made me feel very cozy & comfortable being there :-)

Food- Tastes like simple but delicious home-cooked meals! Fusion between Japanese and European food. I had the oyako don (about $9) which was just eggs, onions, and chicken over rice. How could something so simple taste so good? I'm not a big fan of rice, but I gobbled up my whole dish, which was rich and flavorful. Also came with a house salad and soup. Check in on Yelp and try their Yuzu soda- it's really unique! Tasted like soda w/ kumquats.. 
Unfortunately I was too full for any dessert.. but they do have a variety of green tea desserts.. and I love green tea so I'll definitely be back for those!
Do like their Facebook for updates, the owner is always adding and trying out new menu items.

Service- the owner was sweet and attentive. You can tell he really loves his restaurant and cares for his customers.

18994,1,1550102400000,"This is by far my favorite place to eat authentic, flavorful, fresh, and beautifully prepared Mexican food. 

I should actually use the word cuisine because the food is on such a higher level. It's obvious they use fresh ingredients and make the dishes from scratch. My husband and I love to share a big bowl of the Posole. So tasty with all the fixings,  just like abuela used to make. The tortillas have that salty tinge of homemade that is identical to the homemade tortillas I ate as a kid.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.  My husband and I had a bit of a rough weekend so we were looking for some deeply satisfying comfort food. Otro was perfect! Despite the fact it was over 100 degrees out, we asked to be seated on the patio. No one judged or looked at us like we were crazy. Just the opposite, we were made so welcome, they kicked on the misters and fans and we were in heaven. Our own private patio. It was as if we had the place to ourselves. The staff is so friendly and accomodating. 

We began with the Tuna crudo which were paper thin slices of sushi grade Ahi tuna swimming in a tasty citrus vinagrette and red chile peppers /jalepenos dotting the plate. I could eat that every day of the week, 3 meals a day. 

In the past we've had the pork belly taco / burrito but this time we arrived too late and they were out of pork belly so we ordered the rib eye taco /burritos. We were not at all disappointed. So tender and seasoned to perfection.

We enjoyed our meal with a couple of tasty cocktails, the Maryland for me which is a light, zesty lemon gin beverage that tastes like a bubbly lemon drop in liquid form due to the addition of proseco. My husband had his fave, the bloody Mary which has several veggies for the garnish. 

To me, Otro is a special don't miss kind of dining experience. If you want to try authentic, clean, fresh and beautifully prepared Mexican cuisine, this is YOUR best bet!",1

19000,2,1550620800000,"Really wanted to like this place and i bought two groupons.  Probably deserves 3.5 stars. Listen, the service is very good.  Last night I called a take out order in, and it was ready and all wrapped up 20 mins later when i got there to pick it up; server was very friendly.  You also get a good amount of food for the price ($10-$15); you get the piece of fish, two sides (ive only had veges and red beans + rice), and a cornbread muffin.    

However, the fish is just not that good.  I got two orders last night, 1 walleye and 1 snapper, both grilled.  One of the filets look like like some massacred the fish with a dull machete.  The other filet looks appealing, but had some small bones in it.  The taste of both was also very bland, and neither really tasted fresh; rather, they were somewhat tough and dry - so i doubt the fish is actually fresh.   They should also include a lemon wedge.  No idea why they dont.  However, the sides were very good and the muffin was a nice surprise.   

So, you get a decent ""fresh"" fish meal and with a good amount of food for under 15 bucks, so its not that bad.  But, on the other hand, the fish is just not very good.  Maybe if you get it fried it will taste better - but then whats the point of getting fish if your just going to make it unhealthy?",2

The restaurant has a few rows of small tables at which you can eat.",1

Got the Lobster Pho to share with 7 girls ($50). Nice to have a bite each to try. Very flavorful and lobster was cooked perfectly.

The beef carpaccio is really good. Has a little smokey flavor to it.

The egg rolls and spring rolls are ok. Nothing special.

Now for the bone marrow pho. It's massive and a ton of work. Ask for gloves to dig out all that marrow and make sure you order a side of noodles because it doesn't come with it. DELICIOUS!",2

There's no line in drive through and maybe 10 people in the dining room, and that's it. The dining room is also disgusting, and customers are having to clean the booths themselves. Will NOT return.

19039,3,1550534400000,"The decor and staff were nice but unfortunately the sushi was just not up to par. My husband and I ordered the rok and roll (?), the el chapo roll with some sort of tomatillo sauce and a sashimi platter. The rok and roll is about 5 pieces of sushi on skewers that resemble lollipops. The fish was more like a cheap chopped up filling and had a texture similar to canned tuna. There was very little flavor. The el chapo roll was tiny and again had very little flavor. The sashimi was the best dish we ordered but still tasted a bit dry, almost as if it wasn't fresh. We love sushi and never have a problem finishing what we order (which is usually more than 2 rolls and a few pieces of sashimi), but we didn't even finish the food here. Our meal came out to $200 so it was definitely a huge disappointment (especially when we were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary). Also, kind of off topic but the restroom is very small and is shared with men's stalls on one side and women's on the other. It is strange and uncomfortable. Every person in there was complaining that they felt awkward and was not a fan of the space. Would not recommend.",2

The medic sent up to us paid more attention to the vent in the fire place than us being ill because he was trying to cover the hotel and say we were wrong when the engineer that had already come up before him is the one who explained to us that the vent was broken. We called an ambulance since the medic wasn't doing his job but we were told all costs would be on us. They refused to offer me any sort of compensation or even food credits. I paid over a $1,000 for this room for 3 nights and it is the worst stay I have ever had in Vegas. I can go on and on about how poor there customer service is and how terrible of an experience we have had. Since they are refusing to offer any compensation we are now suing them over the incident. I would love for anybody who reads this review to call me personally at 626-354-9228. I want to make sure that no one has to go through what we did and pay this hotel.

19068,1,1551052800000,"Let me start by saying that this is our first visit to Gio's and we did not read the reviews until after we arrived.  We started our experience with being greeted and seated very promptly.  We met our server Jade and she was outstanding as well.  We decided to start with the wings and my wife had the house salad.  They both arrived shortly there after and let me tell you the Ranch dressing was out of this world!  My wife loved the salad and the blue cheese dressing and her salad as well.  Then I went for my first wing?  Yep, you guessed it the chicken was spoiled.  That really sucks because the sauce was great as well!  Next my son got the personal deep dish cheese pizza and the wife got the lasagna, me I got the entree size Italiano salad.    So let's go from worst to first.  The salad was the worst.  Way to much Vinegar in the dressing kind of ruined the salad.  The lasagne  was a good attempt but just fell short of the mark being that is one of the dishes Gio's is known for, 1 ball, 2 strikes,  now for the best.  My son and wife both lived the pizza!  So at the end of the night Gio's gets 2 stars.  Not sure we will come back or not.  However we tried.

So the day after my review of Gio's I received a message from one of the managers apologizing for the bad experience we had and asked my family and I to return and give them another chance.  The same day I received a phone call from Vicki the general manager of Gio's expressing the same message and asking my wife son and I to join her for dinner.  I agreed and we scheduled our visit for Friday evening.  

We had basically the same dinner with a few minor changes, let me tell you our experience was the exact opposite of our previous experience.  The food was great!!!  The service was great!! The overall experience was outstanding!  We will definitely return.  Also I would like to correct a previous mistake.  Our server was Jay.  We had the privilege of having her help us again and between her and Vicki it was a great visit.  

We will be back!!",3

We were promised a 2 night stay at the Jockey Club if we went to a timeshare presentation.  What happened is, we get to Vegas and the Jockey Club has no reservation for us.  We go upstairs to the presentation room and they give us a number to call because according to them our presentation was cancelled.  We call Resort Stay International and they tell us not to worry that it has been taken care of and they procured our room.  We go through the presentation (2 1/2 hours later) and go to check in.  No reservation!  Back on the phone again with RSI and now they tell us that we are to go to the Tropicana instead.  Argh....we already have our luggage in the Jockey Club storage and have paid for 3 days of valet parking. So, instead of a 1 bedroom suite, we will be in a standard room at the Tropicana.

19079,1,1550102400000,"Scottsdale Quarter is Scottsdale's version of cute urbanism. Located off Scottsdale Road a quarter of a mile south of Bell Road/ Frank Floyd Boulevard, it is an outdoor shopping mall that resembles a modern village.

  Cruising on Scottsdale Road it is so easy to mistake Scottsdale Quarter for an Apple Store next to a few high end shops. Unlike  typical shopping centers, cute urbanism does not overdue it with advertising the stores to passing motorists. We discovered the Scottsdale Quarter on a walk from the Sleep Inn to the Apple Store.

  I am more of a foodie than a shopper. In my case, Scottsdale Quarter is a nice place to go see a movie, sip a coffee in Press Coffee, people watch, and grab a bite to eat. Being a former New Yorker I was glad to see Grimaldi's Pizza.

  Scottsdale Quarter is a good mall. It's strong points are people scale architecture, a nice park that features a fountain, and nice restaurants and shops. It's weak points are that it is a representation of a village without residential and a grocery store. Another weakness is that it is a representation of a pedestrian scale village that is primarily accessible by the automobile.

  If I lived in Scottsdale, I would definitely return to Scottsdale Quarter. Being that I live in Las Vegas, I will remember Scottsdale Quarter when I visit their version of cute urbanism: Town Square.",1

I'm going to give these guys an updated 5 star review because they did the right thing and made up for it, which is rare. They clearly wanted my business.

19124,2,1549843200000,"LOCATION: (3/5)
The hotel is located on the strip, but tucked away behind Planet Hollywood and is connected to the Miracle Miles shops. It's quite convenient to get to, especially since I stayed at Westgate (the only under 21 hotel in Vegas) which is SO far away. There is a Walgreens about 5 minutes walking distance away, so that's basically all I needed fort my stay there. This isn't in the center of the strip per se, but it isn't too inconvenient to get to. 

HOTEL: (4/5) The hotel itself is quite decent and clean, and the pool was nice and relaxing. The pool water was a little cold though (May 2017), and it would have been great if it was slightly heated. 

ROOM: (3/5) I may be spoiled with staying in much nicer hotels but don't get me wrong this wasn't a bad hotel. First of all, the room is HUGE. I had a living room with a projector, a kitchenette so you can cook, microwave, keep things in the full sized fridge. The bedroom was decent and had a jet tub in the same room, and a spacious master bathroom. 

I didn't like the smell of the room, it smelled off - like a mixture of sweat/mildew and something I can't quite put my finger on - stale air conditioner? Also I didn't like how the toilet was black. I can't see how clean/dirty the toilet is. I also wish there was a hand held shower in the shower itself.

We wanted to use the jetted tub, but upon turning the jets on, black dirty bits of who knows what started floating in the tub. With that said, we didn't end up taking a bath in the dirty jetted tub. Overall this place wasn't too bad, but it just looked kind of tacky and dirty. Dirty in the sense that the red sectional leather couch looked like multiple orgies were held on it, and that tacky zebra fabric printed chaise chair right in front of the large mirror was OBVIOUSLY used for intimate times. It just felt unclean to me. The whole room. Like it needed to be cleansed of the sex that permeated into the sheets and furniture and floor. 

Then again, I'm a spoiled brat who loves staying at the Ritz Carlton, Mandarin Oriental and Shangri La - so if you're used to staying at Motels/standard hotels - this hotel would be heavenly!",2

The chicken was tender and delicious; it went really well with the rice and the garlic sauce was a good addition but I didn't find it to be necessary (which is not how it is at some other restaurants). I'm not a huge fan of tabouli but I liked how they had made it here, it didn't have an over-powering taste. I'm very critical of hummus typically and I enjoyed this one.

Mac King himself was extremely endearing and approachable, making audience participation safe and enjoyable (it was all completely voluntary). At the end of the show, he makes himself available to chat with.

19205,3,1549065600000,"I came here with my mom and a friend who was visiting from overseas.
I thought it would be a nice place because my previous three dinners here over the years have generally been good. However, it seems that the portions have shrunk and the quality of service has gone down significantly. It was a Tuesday night, and maybe they didn't expect a full house, so there was a single waiter serving the entire restaurant. This meant that we had to wait 20 minutes just to place our orders, and we waited another 20 for our apps, another 20 for our mains, and another 20 for our desserts. The bill, you guessed it, took another 20. The waiter was running around as quickly as he could, and we thought he was a good sport until we settled the bill and he asked if we needed change. When we said yes, his attitude went from professional to curt. When he returned with our change, he very rudely announced our exact amount of change, as if to imply that we are too cheap to give him a 40% tip, which is what we would have given him had we not asked for change. For the mediocre quality of service, the excruciatingly long wait time, and that rude comment at the end, he definitely did not deserve a 40% tip. The saving grace was the food. Despite that portions are less generous than I remember, the lamb shank and pork were very tender. My mahi mahi, on the other hand, was overcooked and dry. Flavour was still good. As much as I used to love this restaurant, I'll have to think twice next time about coming here.",2

Cardio equipment if often broken or out of service and their is no sense of urgency to repair things including the sauna.

Unless they are able to retain and recruit the  ""senior"" aged clientele (which is their primary membership demographic it appears), this gym will be bankrupt in no time.

19211,2,1550275200000,"I wish you could do a star rating with a caveat. So this is my caveat.

I went with two friends and a baby to brunch here in January. I am a breakfast fiend, and will try to eat it for every meal, and though we have our usuals, we decided to find a place at random and give it a shot. Enter Coca Cafe. Of course, I yelped it before we entered, just for a heads up, but we were going anyway.

Quick story: food was AMAZING, service was eh, staff was just not so nice.

We got there around 12:30, expecting a wait. It looked packed, so I went in alone while my other two friends and her baby waited outside. The sign (I can't remember if it was on the door or on a post as soon as you got in) said to sign in. The usual. There was no hostess stand so I waded through a couple tables to get to the register. There were four ladies behind the counter, milling about at the register and in making smoothies, doing what they do. And I stood there smiling. So maybe 30 seconds passed (but really, anything more than an immediate acknowledgement, even if it's just a 'I'll be right with you' seems long to me) and then I finally said, 'Uh, hi, do I need to put my name down for a table?' The girl at the register just said, without looking at me, 'Yeah, put your name and number down' and pushed a piece of blank computer paper across the counter at me. Okay. Wrote that down. Seemed weird that it wasn't official looking. Kinda worried about eating now. 'So is that all?' She said 'Yeah, and it looks like maybe 45 minutes to an hour for four.' Okay.

So I walked out and we shopped around.

Around 40 minutes later, we went back. My other friend popped in to check on the status. They said 15-20 minutes. So we waited. A waitress then popped her head outside and called my name. I guess this is a good time to say that there's no waiting room inside - so if it's cold outside and there's a wait, it's probably not worth it. Luckily, it was a warm day and definitely more bearable with the cute boutiques around. Anyway - back to this. She called our name, we gathered up our stuff, and filed in. She had already left the door, so we stepped inside and stood there awkwardly for a second or two before calling across the restaurant (which is small, so it wasn't that disruptive), 'Is this our table?' and pointing to an empty table. The one who had poked her head out the door was behind the counter and said, ' Yeah.' Okay, that's strange. Normally you show people where they're sitting.  I know we had more stuff than the quick pick-up with the baby in tow, but we weren't holding up for more than two minutes. We were starving.

So we sat down. A different girl popped over and said, 'Oh, you only have three people and a baby.' To which we said, 'Yes.' And she left. Strange. The same girl then came back and asked what we wanted to drink. Two of us ordered smoothies and the third order a chai tea latte (Around $3 or $4 each). We waited a bit (but were poring over the menu so it wasn't bad) then a different waiter came and had my friend re-order her smoothie (they were out of mango). No big. He then brought out our drinks. The smoothies were fabulous. Thick and fruity and so good. We each ordered something different so as to try bites. I don't remember the food coming quick or slow (and if I thought slow it was only because I was starving) so I'd say the service was average. 

The food. was. AMAZING. I had the almond french toast with a lemon sauce and strawberries and blueberries, one friend had the lemon pancakes, and the other had an egg white omelet with goat cheese, spinach, and grape tomatoes and a croissant. Seriously amazing. The bread was the good baguette-style stuff, not the stuff from the sliced square loaf, the fruit was fresh and firm, and the taste was just phenomenal. We loved every bite of our own and as we picked off each other's. And it was cheap - each of our plates was about $8. Very reasonable.

Our waitress came to clear our plates (I don't remember her stopping by at any time to refill our water [annoying because I'm a camel] or ask if everything was alright) and then said the first nice thing to my friend: 'Your baby is cute.' She then laid down the check without asking if we wanted one or separate (pretty usual). She left and we laid down our three cards and asked if we could split it three ways (already making it easier than splitting out our exact pieces). She said she could only take two cards. Strange, but whatever. We were over their attitudes. Paid and left.

So the summary of that: awesome food, don't expect  the same of the service.",2

Unlike their Irvine location, they don't have any USC gear, so it's not on my regular shopping list.

I've found many birthday and Christmas gifts here.  I bought a golf accessory set for a few of my golf buddies for Christmas last month.....they loved it and it was priced just right at $14.99.

Pad see-eu with beef was great, I added the bright red chili sauce to light it up. Kids had Khua Kai noodle and bbq pork with Chinese sausage fried rice, both very mild and kid friendly. The salmon avocado curry was really good, bright orange curry with coconut milk and tiny shreds of kaffir lime leaf, and just a bit of heat. My fault for not ordering the hot stuff, but what we had was fresh and tasty. 

Wait staff was friendly and helpful, water glasses filled often and plates cleared timely. 

The men's bathroom, however, was another story. The grime covering the light switch and the door was worthy of the worst gas station bathroom, a foot above and below the knob it was black with grime.

the menu options all looked delicious, but to ease my guilt about eating out so often , I finally settled on the brunch santé, which consists of organic granola with cashew nuts, yoghurt and blueberries, poached eggs on greens and whole wheat toast, goats milk cheese with pesto (which was spread on the toast), cheddar sticks with fig, and fresh fruits. Each brunch selection also came with a glass of orange juice (with pulp :) ) and amuse-Bouche, which is bite-sized bread pudding with chocolate and caramel (if I understood correctly). 

The amuse- bouche was pretty good - it wasn't too sweet. The highlight though, was the main meal. I really enjoyed their yogurt with granola - it tasted creamier than the yogurts I buy at the supermarket. I also really enjoyed the poached eggs on toast - the goats cheese and pesto made it very tasty and flavourful (normally, I don't like goat cheese because I think the flavour is too strong, but this wasn't the case at all here!)

My friend got the toasted banana and coconut bread, which came with fresh fruit and yogurt with blueberries. I tried a bit of her bread, and we both enjoyed it very very much!

The first time we were here, the cashier didn't really speak English. I wanted to order a hot grass jelly and she told me it was ""burning"". I wasn't sure what she meant so we went for the cold instead. We ordered a Meet Fresh signature and a #4. We were given a beeper and was told to go upstairs. We waited around 15 minutes for the food to be ready. Would've expected it to come quicker as everything is pretty much premade.

The grass jelly was very smooth and not too hard. I was quite surprised that there was ice on the bottom of the grass jelly. I would've preferred it if there was less ice or none at all as it made the grass jelly very watery. The sweet potato/taro balls are basically a chewy glutinous rice ball with pretty much no flavour. Not a fan of them. 

The second time we decided to give the hot grass jelly a try. We ordered a #4 grass jelly again but substituted tapioca and taro/sweet potato balls with mung beans and peanuts. We also tried the tofu pudding in almond soup.

I finally know why the cashier told us the hot grass jelly would be ""burning"". Rather than firm grass jelly, when you order it hot, it is almost completely liquid. To better describe it, the grass jelly was all melted. After a while it became more slimy. If they offer hot grass jelly, they should make a firmer variation suitable of serving it hot. They used the same grass jelly as the cold one. From my pictures, you can clearly see all the toppings have sunk as it wasn't firm enough to hold up the toppings.

The tofu pudding in almond soup wasn't bad, but the tofu pudding wasn't smooth enough. It was also a little too firm for my liking. I liked the almond soup. On its own it's pretty sweet, but since the tofu pudding was pretty much unsweetened, the combination was great.",1

Honestly I wouldn't think an ice cream shop would be hot being that it IS an ice cream shop. . It was HOT outside and it was HOT and stuffy on the inside as well! So while I was waiting 25-30 minutes for them to finally get to my order, I'm sweating and feeling so uncomfortable. The shop gets pretty busy and everyone is kind of just standing around waiting for their order so everything is just hectic and loud! 

But anyways, if you do decide to give Jolly a try I would recommend the Caramel Macchiato if you're into coffee flavors. It's the right amount of sweet with a hint of espresso and 2 hazelnut wafer sticks.",2

I wound up with an open faced sandwich and some canned peaches (she did mention they were caned but the gravy was heaped on and it turned me off (over the top on the gravy)  So I had beef, bread, gravy and canned peaches.

So, if you're willing to elbow a little,  to peel some apples, to eat the ends and pieces of butcher bacon that just can't be beat, come on Wednesday--early!  That's when they have the smoking bargains on produce, even if you may have to wave away a little fruit fly or two. 
Not only that,  but the spices are some of the cheapest prices you'll find anywhere. Expect to use your Spanish here, too, if you want to chat with the other shoppers.

We received a very thoughtful handwritten note at check-in, we chose to upgrade to a one bedroom suite for a nominal amount and we were soooo glad we did. Wow! What a view of the strip we had! The room was spotless, the turn-down service was appreciated and wonderful (they even turned on relaxing classical music for us). There is a television WITHIN the bathroom mirror - it was amazing! We used the pool & jacuzzi and found both to be clean and the pool deck cleanliness to be maintained properly. We ordered a drink each ($14 per drink) - they were delicious! We wanted to have some friends up for cocktails so we asked for the glasses/dish/pan set to be delivered to our room, it was there within 5 minutes. :) The Valets were friendly and courteous. We're always a bit nervous having our new car valeted; however, we looked our car over each time and saw no damage so that was good! We ate the breakfast buffet (about $22/pp) twice and loved it! The hot food was freshly made and well stocked, but the best part of the buffet (in my opinion) was the fresh fruit. Wow! Absolutely perfect mixed berries, strawberries, cantaloupe, watermelon...mmmmmm! TIP: You may also ask for toast and they'll make it just for you. The Fitness Center was clean and very busy. It's got free weights, machines, treadmills, ellipticals, bikes - something for everyone. The complimentary shuttle will take you to either Wynn OR Caesar Palace's Forum Shops. The drivers were friendly, courteous, and safe. Shuttles run until midnight. ** BONUS TIP: Trump price-matches hotel rates so if you find a better rate somewhere else, give them a call and they'll match the price. Benefit to that is that then you earn reward points, get better chance of getting free upgrades, etc. - HIGHLY recommend!!

Walked in to the joint and it was super busy like packed.

Wile in line we were able to watch the tortilla ladies work their magic.

Ordering at Cafe Rio makes you understand what a traffic cop feels like when he blows his whistle and holds his hands up. It's loud in there and there is so much going on down the line it's amazing they can even focus. 
SBL ordered the taco chicken salad and I ordered the sweet pork quesadilla, oh momma!! That sweet pork measures so good it's on the stupid meter. I love it, and we get each other. SBL wondered why all the lettuce and everything else had to be placed on the top. I said because it looks pretty, but I'm sure there's some science behind it.
In line there was so many orders being filled at once, our food turned into keep your eye on the white ball under the cup game. We lost Mini Mi's quesadilla a couple times, but it always found its way back to us. 
We finally made it to the register and upon checkout we were pretty sure they didn't charge us for everything, but honestly we couldn't tell you what they missed because it was so dang hectic in there. We were so glad to walk out the door. Not all Cafe Rio's are created equal I guess.

UPDATE 11/9/2013 YELP deleted my photo of the container of chicken tikka masala next to a can of coke. The picture shows the size of the container, smaller than the size of a coke. This was my order, my experience so YELP is being an ass to remove my photo.


On to the review:

This place was a total SHAM. We bought the $25 for $12 take out Groupon. We showed up and asked for a menu (no menu from Kohinoor online, not even on their Facebook. SCAM) , they said they had no menu, WHAT? After asking a couple times the owner said to someone else ""get the menu"" and cocked his head. They managed to come up with a ridiculously priced menu after being there for 10 minutes. $12.99 for chicken tikka masala with no rice or naan. The Biltmore doesn't even charge these prices.

We are a regular of Curry Corner literally a stones throw away and the owner starts talking crap about Curry Corner. At CC you get the tikka masala, rice AND add garlic naan for $10. 

Anyway you don't eat chicken tikka masala without rice or naan (and no other restaurant we have ever been to HASN'T offered it) so my husband ordered this for me (it came to $20 here!!!!!) and his Lamb Biryani ($12.99). When the food comes and the owner shows my husband the food my husband is shocked SHOCKED he is charging $12.99 for what CC charges $8, then the owner tells my husband that CC sells a smaller size, that my husband could go to CC right now if he didn't believe him. WHAT!!!! We eat there once a week! I get the same thing @ CC and we would know what size they give us!

My husband is Arab and is talking to the owner who is totally swindling my husband. He gives my husband a small mango yogurt drink and then he goes on to tell us that if we stop going to CC and go to his restaurant that he would sell us the buffet for $8.99 and our kids would eat free (they are 26 months and 9 months).  Then he takes my husband next door to the store to show him the halal meat (is this when they put the buffet food in the take out containers or take the buffet food to the back and make chicken tikka masala and biryani out of the buffet spread? No proof but I wouldn't doubt this).

So my husband said ok, he paid for our food difference $8 and left.
When we got home, his biryani was BEEF not lamb. There was no mix up, we were the only ones in the restaurant, and my husband was talking to the owner the entire time.

This was a HORRIBLE Groupon experience, and a total scam, offering a take out Groupon for $12 for $25 worth of food and then offering ridiculous prices and claiming they don't have a menu.
BY THE WAY they have a lunch buffet for $6.99 and dinner for $9.99 WITH CTM, samosas, rice, naan etc, so prey tell me how they are selling chicken tikka masala TO GO for $12.99 with no rice or naan?

My husband threw out his biryani the beef was inedible (chewy and old, the dish was room temperature) and then he ended up eating leftover bbq pulled chicken sandwich that I made yesterday. I took pictures of my CTM and the container is smaller than the size of a can of coke. CTM was room temperature (it should have been HOT) edible, not good, but not bad  but I wouldn't go back if it was even $5.

In the real world we pretty much got $10 worth of food (inedible BEEF biryani) and we paid $20.",2

19558,2,1550275200000,"I think it was because the fight was going on and a very odd woman was laying down and going a bit nutty that made me give this place 4 stars. Mesa Grill is located near the Pure and the Sports book in Caesars Palace. The Pacquiao vs Margarito fight was that night, so getting to Mesa was a little difficult. We had a 7:45 reservation and if you miss your reservation you are charged a 50 dollar per person cancellation fee. I did not want to take that risk. We checked in for our reservations and were asked to wait near the bar. Dan and I ordered some semi custom margaritas. The margaritas were awesome.. I mean tasty and strong. I opted to get the basic margarita and add a shot of grand mariner to give it a little citrus kick. Dan went with the Margarita with Patron. We got our drinks and before we took our first sip, our table was ready. Our server was friendly but he looked a little preoccupied. Like I said earlier.. there was this woman dining alone who was acting peculiar. The EMT was called, but she was nutty not sick. She kept on moving back and forth between seats and laying down, this made a uncomfortable dinner. I think this took away from the Mesa experience because the server and staff were focused on this lady. Also since it is near the sports book, you can hear every cheer, jeer, and swear coming from the sports book. 

The reason we made our reservation is because we love Bobby Flay and his chefs did not disappoint. We started ROUGH CUT TUNA ""NACHOS"" and it was tasty. the Mango - Habanero Hot Sauce and Avocado Crema complemented the tuna. It was a sweet and tangy starter. For dinner, I went with the NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and I swear I saw food god that day. It was prepared to perfection and the Bourbon - Ancho Chile Sauce was so sweet yet spicy. I wasn't a fan of the tamale but the meat made up for it. Dan got a steak and I cannot comment on it because I was loving my pork. I think I only gave him a small bite because I didn't want to share and I cannot remember the flavors. We did order another round of margaritas and did not get any dessert because we needed to get to Mirage to see Jo Koy. At the end of our dinner, our server did give us plastic cups to take with us so that was a nice extra that we would have forgotten. I feel if it was a different day I would be giving this place 5 starts but the service and the proximity of the sports book made me take it down to 4.",2

19561,3,1550534400000,"This restaurant is my first experience with Malaysian food.  I really enjoyed it and have been back many times since. The beef satay is one of the best things I've tasted in Chinatown. This is family owned and they are the employees.  I LOVE supporting family owned businesses, especially when the family is actually there working!

PROS: The menu has a picture for EVERY item listed.
             Homemade Green Curry 
             Lo Mee ~ noodles in homemade soy sauce, topped with chicken & mushrooms
             Hokkien Char Mee
             Roti canai
             ***The COCONUT PUDDING**** Served INSIDE a coconut ~ ice cold!! 

CONS: Could use music or something atmospheric.

They also have really cool lighting fixtures if you happen to look up.  Located in the Asian Pacific shopping plaza ~ on the 2nd level",2

The sushi is impeccable especially the yellowtail that they have. I would also suggest getting the edamame and peppers they serve. This place is great and not to mention the MC is hilarious. I would give it 10 stars if I could.",2
19589,2,1549152000000,"In comparison to Ten Ichi - their scallops at Matsuda is quite big for AYCE and plentiful! I've been to Heart sushi before in Mississauga and their scallops are not as good as here. They also have sweet shrimp which is a plus for me since I love sweet shrimp and their octopus sashimi is very succulent and meaty. They also have the squid but chopped up so the texture is not as nice as it would be whole.

The garlic beef steak is pretty good - my friends really enjoyed that and their pressed sushi as well. You don't get to see many places with pressed sushi so it was nice to try it out. 

Wait time surprisingly wasn't that busy on a Friday however I still made reservations nonetheless. Usually people say despite making reservations, you may not get a seat right away depending on the people so if you are in a rush somewhere - it is most likely best to get their earlier before the reservation to get the seat and accommodate the timing!",2

These people are everywhere, trying to make conversation and ""help you get tickets for shows"" if you come to their sales presentation. This presentation will lead you into exactly what everyone else's review says. I did not go to this presentation, because I had already gone to one with Grandview, which is exactly like theirs.

Do not be swindled! They will take up more time than they promise and they will insult you and ruin your day, if not your entire vacation! Avoid these idiots.",2
19591,2,1551052800000,"Every time I've come in here it's been an overall good experience. My husband and brother-in-law got sucked into the vaping craze and visit the Vapor Loft pretty often. They buy everything from juices to vapor mods here. To be honest, most of what they know about vaping they learned from the dudes who work here. The staff at Vapor Loft take vaping to a science. They are extremely knowledgeable and patient, which is generally hard to come by in the vaping world. The cozy size of Vapor Loft also makes for a more personal atmosphere than say, Pink Spot. 

On my most recent check-in, the Mr. bought a fancy new mechanical mod. The whole package cost about $130-140. Plus they have a military discount! The associate spent over an hour (no joke) going through the ins and outs of how to maintain a mechanical mod with my husband. He got him all set up and offered advice on where to buy things like organic cotton balls and a tank atomizer. 

Whenever we visit Container Park, it goes without saying that a stop at the Vapor Loft is necessary. These guys know their stuff- nuff said.",2

For our entrees we ordered the 18oz bone in filet to split and oh my goodness it was the best steak I've ever had!! So tasteful and tender! We also split the two 8oz lobster tails which were to die for! Dipped in butter it was seafood heaven. For dessert we chose the butter cake and it did not disappoint!

I went back-and-forth with them and another Hyundai dealership (however, I have to say that I love to haggle) until the other dealership told me that Henderson was basically ""paying me"" to buy from them and they wouldn't match the price on  the same vehicle. I started with their Internet Dept., then Jason (the salesman) did everything to put the deal together and the J.P. (the Credit Manager) quickly and efficiently put the deal together. We even get free oil changes for as long as she owns the vehicle. I could not be happier with their entire team.",2
19625,2,1551052800000,"The food is decent.  However, the service is horrible.  The worst was that it is provided by the owner and he seemed oblivious to his doings. 

I went with my entire family, including 2 kids.  Knowing from previous experiences that the service is slow we called in advance to order for the kids.  The owner said that is something they don't do but stated that the food for the kids will arrive in 5 min.

THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.  Also when he took our order, he was distracted with other matters; he kept looking at other tables and we had to repeat our order several times. 

After our order, we sat and waited.  We started to observe that other customers who came after us, received their food and one couple actually paid and left before we got our food.  When we shared this with the owner he shared that he never placed the order in the system.

He admitted his mistake 45 minutes into us being there but never offered to make things better.  The food still did not come out quickly.  

Then he brought food for the kids with mirch (jalapeño) when specifically requested mild.  Then he brought food, like bhakri but nothing to eat it with.  In general the owner was clueless in his approach and seemed that he wanted to speak/hang out with customers that were his friends.

It was a horrible experience and we ended up leaving.  I felt horrible giving the feedback to him, but even after the fact nothing was done except admitting he forgot to hit the send button on the order.  

I would recommend going to this place only if you have patience to endure poor service.",2
19638,3,1550534400000,"I have seen the Evil Dead 1 + 2, and even know of many Army of Darkness scenes, I'm not sure why I really even watched the films in the first place except to say I was a teen that liked corny horror movies, quick 2-second scenes of scantily clad women, and had nothing better to do on the weekends at that time.  So, yes, the last time I watched any of this stuff was in the late 80's- early 90's, but the tree-rape scene will never leave my mind.

Aside from that, they should have left this franchise DEAD... yes, I said it.  I can see the cult appeal to this musical, with the splatter zone and catch phrases.  But when a movie is so bad in the first place, you can't expect to make anything good from it... not even a toy Boomstick (ok... maybe a toy Boomstick might be cool).  That is where the 4D musical falls in.

The Ash character was very good, even some of the other bit parts acted well, but overall the writing of the play made me want to fall asleep as well and I wasn't even drunk, it was just so damn boring.

The worst was the actress who played the sister.  You couldn't understand a damn word she was saying or singing.  That goes for many of the songs and what they all were saying.  Of course.. there were some true fans there who knew every single word and were even dancing along in the splatter zone... so at least somebody knew what the hell they were saying.  The other terrible part is they pandered way to much on the swearing and splatter aspect to get a laugh.  I'm all for this, but it just got repetitive, unimaginative, and boring.  Seriously, the damn play is boring and I was a guy who liked these kinds of movies.

So.... 2 stars for the hard-core geek fans who will like it.  That's it.  Please don't bring your girlfriend or wife to this thinking she will like it, she won't.  Trust me dude, don't do it.  In fact, just don't even go yourself and save your strength.",2

Boy, was I pleasantly surprised. Their attention to detail for their customer service was impressive - from their cucumber water to asking about my preference for different kinds of massage (not that I had any idea what each kind was about). It was relaxing and the staff was super friendly, professional, and personable. Needless to say, I immediately brought my girlfriend with me for a couple's massage the next week. The service was consistent and deserves my business again. 

I highly recommend this to people who are overworked and need a new revenue for relaxation. This is definitely a good place to start and learn about what real relaxation is.",2

It's more expensive than some other food on campus, but for crepes, it's pretty fairly priced. I love watching my crepe being made, from the batter being poured onto the pan until the foil-wrapped triangle is in my hand. 

The veggie crepe has tomato, spinach, cheese, and basil sauce (which I asked them to go light on). It was hot and delicious, though maybe a little too cheesy for my taste. The sweet crepe was made with fresh diced strawberry, a little powdered sugar, and the perfect amount of Nutella. It was also delicious.

As for the comment about the utensils in an earlier review, there's been a little basket hanging off the window with utensils and napkins when I've been there. The foil-wrapped version makes for a convenient and handheld food (though it does get a little messy at the end, especially since I didn't want to waste a drop of Nutella.)

The owner is very friendly. I'd get something from here every time I saw it if I thought my wallet could take it. For now, though, crepes are a treat (which is, perhaps, for the better).",1

We went there for brunch on Sunday, and their brunch menu offers  traditional brunch dishes with some twists. All the components on the plate were cooked to perfection. Home fries were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and seasoned well.I ordered french toast
topped with berries and apple butter. The first few bites were heavenly. Good balance of sweetness and richness from the toast and apple butter and sourness from berries.
If you are looking for hearty breakfast/brunch with a lot of food on the plate, this is not the best option for you.",3

There are very few restaurant options on the lonely stretch of highway my friend and I were traveling. We passed the Hen House on the way to our destination and I made a mental note: That place looks awesome! We decided to stop on our way home.

It says that they have a gift shop, but I wouldn't really call it that. It was more like an alcove full of empty shelves with a few random truck stop junk items left over from years past. The dining area is extremely small. Luckily there was a booth open so we didn't have to wait. Our service was wonderful!! But wonderful service can't save the food. 

My friend had a bit of a problem choking on her chicken strips, she said they were too dry. I thought I was going to have to do the Heimlich. I ordered a chicken salad because of some dietary restrictions. There wasn't really anything else I could order, so I gave it a shot. I definitely could have made better myself at home. Strangely enough they had wonderful cole slaw. 

The rest of the menu was pretty much just diner food - lots of fried chicken options, sandwiches, breakfast food. Nothing was really a signature dish....just food you'd find at any other hole in the wall greasy spoon.",2

The colour selection is amazing and displayed in sequence which is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional. This place would also be suitable for group events, both for its space and location which is right off the subway line and plenty of parking on and around Danforth.

I got a pedi, I'm about ready for my next one and the colour is still going strong! They don't have the traditional massage chairs, they do offer a shoulder massage while your nails dry. They also offer toe waxing if you need it. 

My one concern is the seating for the pedicures, it's fine for me but I could see it making for an awkward pedi if you are a larger person.

19710,2,1551052800000,"I recently came here because of all the good reviews. I had high hopes and was really looking forward to the experience. Unfortunately my experience was horrible. 

I went into the nail salon on a Wednesday about midday to get a full set of acrylics. The place was a little bit busy but had a few people at stations doing nothing. When I walked in I was greeted and told I would have to wait 25 minutes. I debated on staying but due to the great reviews on here I decided to stay. Big mistake.

I ended up waiting about 40 mins but was constantly reassured that I would be taking  care of in couple of minutes. I was just about to leave when a guy told me that he would take care of me right after he was finished with the girl that he was currently taking care of. Which only took about 3 more minutes. When he finally got started on my nails, he was extremely rough and made me bleed on two different fingers. 

When he finally finished the nails they were crooked. I was very displeased. The nails didn't even get close to the cuticle. The acrylics stopped way before the lunula (white half moon part of the nails). It looked like I had already had my nails for a while and needed them to be filled. Not mention the design was horrible. He even missed a whole side of nail. The whole time he was to busy talking to other people. 

When I brought up to him how unsatisfied I was he ignored me and went to talk to a lady  and the lady came over, not to help but to yell at me. In front of everybody!!  I'm a very  shy person so I was debating on even telling him I was unsatisfied. I was extremely embarrassed. She told me, well yelled at me really, that I shouldn't have picked the design in first place and that it didn't come out like I wanted because he was a man and men can't always do the designs that people want. What kind of argument is that!! I didn't even have a hard design to begin with. All I had wanted was for my acrylics to be painted dark grey with a black French tip, nothing complicated at all, or so I thought. 

 I had gone hoping to get a great experience and ending up with the worst experience of my life. I would never recommend this place to anyone. They don't care about the end results of your nails.",2

 The coffee is affordable, good quality, and fair trade, and there are other delicious drink options as well. There are many different syrup flavors for adding some excitement to your coffee, hot chocolate, or soda, or even for mixing into together to make your own new flavored sodas (a favorite of mine is lavender french vanilla). 
The food choices are also pretty great, if you're not feeling particularly thirsty. The baked goods are delicious, and there are fruits and sandwiches on the healthier side. The popcorn and ice cream go fantastically with the atmosphere of the place, which is friendly and cheery with warm colors and great customer service.

19738,3,1550620800000,"The Trump was a nice hotel, but I'm not sure it was worth the price. First of all, you're in Vegas and you're there to play; it was extremely disappointing to learn that there was no casino in the hotel. What? Trump hotel just off strip and no casino?!? That was a big miss - I wouldn't have booked the place directly, but it's what we ended up getting via Priceline bidding. Anyway, so they have these shuttles to the Wynn and Ceasers to try to make up for it. It works pretty well during the day. The ride to the Wynn is super fast. It's literally a block away on a quiet street. The thing is, the shuttles don't run too late - well relative to Vegas-time.

The lady at the front desk when we checked in wasn't very pleasant. She did a heavy up-sell job on room upgrades. We ended up keeping the room we booked. I noticed it's a trend at these Vegas hotels, but there was this additional $25/night resort fee we had to pay, which wasn't included in our original reservation. I wasn't completely surprised because I stayed a couple nights in another nearby hotel for a couple of nights before this one and they had it as well.

The room itself ended up being fine. It was spacious and had some nice features, like a TV in the bathroom mirror (not like that was practically useful). It was fine and the housekeepers were liberal with the bottled water, which was much appreciated.

I wouldn't stay at the hotel again, because you're paying near the high-end of the spectrum in terms of price, but you aren't getting the full Vegas experience without the  casino and so forth. I'm assuming they're trying to get approved for that as well, but I guess Trump should've played more nicely with Wynn in Atlantic City.

19743,3,1551225600000,"You often hear contractors state that no job is too small, well, I put Patterson Roofing to the test on that claim...all I needed was one single tile to be replaced on my roof, nothing else.  To make matters worse, I live in Surprise, Arizona which usually means an extensive drive for most contractors.  When all the other roofer companies out there turned me down because it wasn't worth their time, Patterson Roofing came to my rescue.  William came to my house to assess the situation, expecting to fix the problem on the spot, but when the spare tiles he brought with him did not fit properly, he had to go on a wild goose chase trying track down a matching tile for my roof.  This was not an easy task as the tiles on my home are no longer available.  This meant that William had to spend his time searching roofing supply stores and walking bone yards trying to find an acceptable matching tile for my roof.  He admitted to me that he could have made one of his spare tiles work, but if he wouldn't do that to his own home, then he wouldn't do that to his customer's home either.  This so called small job turned out to be a big pain in the butt for William, but he never complained or showed any annoyance towards me or the job.

The locals clearly hang out here and know each other. The band, Stef n Rock, was fantastic and played a really fun range of classic rock and pop (everything from Del Shannon to Elvis to George Thorogood to Heart)! I got pulled onto the dance floor by a group of folks older than my parents, and they were so fun! Great price on beers! We only had potato skins to eat so can't speak too much to the food.

19777,3,1549324800000,"Not sure where to start with this restaurant. How about the sight of the host/waiter swatting flies with an electric swatter? What was even more shocking was that he sort of walked over and pointed to our table while still swatting the flies. Would've been slightly ok if he at least put it down. And washed his hands of course before handing us our menus.

The smell of the restaurant is pretty bad because it shares a wall with the nail salon next door. Keep in mind, I've grown up with the smells of nail salons and Vietnamese restaurants my whole life.. but never both combined while dining. Strike 2.

We ordered a pho bowl and com tam (broken rice) dish. The pho broth tasted sweet and the meat seemed old. My rice dish came out missing an item. Nothing looked fresh. Everything tasted gross. Strike 3.

Overall it was a disappointing experience. There are not that many choices in terms of Asian food in the West Valley so I can see why people come here. However, I will never miss Vietnamese food so much that I would go here, ever again. Get your fix in the Chandler area.",2

It woke me up every night despite being situated on the 52nd floor AND on the opposite end of the hotel.  So much for sound proofing.  I could even hear the puny fireworks from the The Siren show at Treasure Island.

This hotel is not connected to anything (i.e., no casino or shops), although there is a nice restaurant and bar in the lobby that serves Starbucks coffee.  Crossing a small street in 100+-degree weather to access the mall became annoying after a while.  Other 5-star hotels on the strip (e.g., Wynn, TheHotel, Bellagio) are interconnected to other hotels and/or shops and a plethora of restaurants, thus allowing one to remain completely indoors if one so chooses.  For me, that's almost a necessity in a city that experiences weather extremes.

It's a shame.  In all fairness it really is a nice luxurious hotel with home-like amenities and awesome city/mountain views.  I was treated well on every visit.  Unfortunately, a return visit will not be likely.",2

We ate at a couple other places this past weekend and it was just basic Pizza it was crap but this pizza was awesome the mac and cheese was so juicy and Rich and tons of sauce and flavor!

19803,1,1549238400000,"--- Review from www.JerseyGirlinVegas.com ---

One night last week, I wanted a quick bite so I used Open Table to find somewhere close by that I had not yet visited. I came across Annie's which really caught my eye. After a little poking around I discovered they had a great happy hour which included 1/2 price appetizers and some drink specials ($2 off wine). 

As I entered, I was blinded from the Las Vegas sun so it took a minute for my eyes to adjust to the dimly lit setting. The friendly host asked where I wanted to sit, I asked the bar since I was by myself. I was a little confused since I didn't see any bar.  She proceeds to the back of the room where she opens a hidden door into the small, intimate bar they called The Lost Weekend. 

I was greeted by a very nice bartender who was very quick to greet me and prompt to get my order. I went with the sampler or ""trio"" which included fried calamari, mozzarella sticks, and friend ravioli. This was more then enough food to make it an entree. I was absolutely stuffed to the gills when I left! Everything was pretty good! I would like to return to try their homemade meatball scampi appetizer, everyone was ranting and raving about it. So I will be returning!",2

The duck poutine pizza is perfect for sharing with your fellow dinning partners. sharing the crumbs that is.If you're going to order the poutine make sure to order the large one you get more bang for the buck. 

service was good here but not exceptional. Forgot the first round of drinks we ordered and found a chicken bone in my pot pie and all i got was a ""sorry it happens sometimes""

(*Skip to the edit to see the end result) I'm on day 1.5 of a three night/four day stay for an event that is using this as the conference HQ.

First the room was clean and fine. Better than motel 6, but not a 5 star high end hotel. I think it's fair for the price TBH. Beds are comfy and no bed bugs (I always check before unpacking). The top sheet situation is a little weird as it's not a fitted sheet so it came undone when I went to pull put the tucked in blanket. Noticed stains on the bed cover but nothing horrific.
The walls ARE thin. I can hear full on conversations in the room next door and children running up and down the halls screaming. I slept fine all night but my event starts late tonight so I was hoping to nap through the day. Other guests in the halls were yelling so nope.
The bathroom is cramped and my toilet paper role fell out. Seems to be missing it's spring?
o
Anyhow room works for sleeping and chilling so it gets a pass.

The lobby is like any casino. Smokey, loud, full of people who look kind of burnt out. I'm not a smoker so I can only last so long, but hey I did win alright at roulette and closed early due to smoke so win for me.

Room service food was fine, prompt, and hot. It's what I expected and the delivery guy was polite.
Buffet food was buffet food. At brunch the lunch items were better than the breakfast items IMO. I did leave because some dude behind me was loudly slurping and chomping with his mouth open and cussing up a storm which was just too obnoxious to chill around.

Staff has all been pleasant. But I always go out of my way to be polite because I get it, this job probably sucks. Dealing with angry and drunk people all day? Pass.

Overall I'd probably stay here again if i had a reason to be in town but my only real complaints are how noisy it is in my room and that I wish there was a third more pricey top tier restaurant in another part of the hotel with super great meals and away from smoke/a-holes. I'm a picky eater.
******************************
Edit: last night and the noise and smoke smell broke me. A loud family with screaming children and adults checked in next door and woke me up. Front desk did call security for me, but if the walls weren't so thin it wouldn't have ever been a problem.
Every time I walk into my room it smells like old stale cigarette smoke. My clothes smell like smoke.
Also found a public hair in my shower after I wrote my original review.
Had to end up at 1 star in the end and I won't be returning.
Staff - you are helpful and pleasant.

i was contacted by clay from this repair shop, he  was contacting me on the owmers behalf(bert)  he offered me $200  for the mis diagnosis  of the front wheel bearings and i explained that these were un needed repairs and this shop is not only unethical but dis honest. the $200 offer is a slap in the face. again please steer clear of this repair shop they are blatantly dishonest and shoul be investigated. i am wondering if the nevada dmv does monitor these shops. 
oh and by the way i reached out to the owner bert and told him i would accept $500 on the $700 original bill. as of this date he has yet to respond. really makes you wonder....beware of this shop.....",2
19885,2,1549929600000,"Okay, I really give this place a 4 1/2 stars, but I'll round up to 5.  

Although the name is deceptive because a bistro?  Really?  Maybe it's the new wave of younger Chinese?  The restaurant is clean and the people working there are Chinese and super friendly, polite.  That is a huge plus and caters to non-Chinese.  

When we came in, they gave us the non-Chinese menu.  My daughter asked what Moo Goo Gai Pan is.  I said, something non-Chinese people order.  My friend who brought us there said they have a Chinese menu, so we asked for that.

Most of the food is Cantonese, but I did see a couple things that were more northern, Mandarin food.  I don't know if they spoke Cantonese, because I only heard people speaking in Mandarin, but their English is very good.

As for the food, it was good and it was normal portions similar to a regular Chinese, Chinese restaurant.  During our near hour there, we saw mostly Chinese people come in, and only 1 table had non-Chinese people there.  

You know when you go to a Chinese restaurant and you see mainly Chinese people eating, it's more authentic and caters to the taste of the Chinese.  We are no exception.

The food was good.  We ordered 5 dishes - Curry Chicken (tasty), Salt & Pepper Pork Chops (decent, but I have had better), Singapore Mai Fun (good), Sizzling Pepper Beef (good taste and very sizzling), Eggplant with Minced Pork Garlic Sauce (I would not recommend as it had a slight sweet taste in it, which is not normal to me).  Four out of the 5 dishes we got were good.  The eggplant wasn't terrible, but it would not be a dish we would get again.  It really wasn't hot & spicy as we expected.  This was an odd taste for this dish that I've had many times at other places.

Service was good.

My only other comment is that most of the dishes did not come with serving spoons.  That was a bit odd that we had to ask for spoons and then they gave a small spoon for one of the dishes.  That is odd.

But, everything else was good.  The food came out hot.  The service was excellent.  We didn't  have to wait too long for the food.  We would come back again and I would recommend to my siblings & their families.",2

I had the baja fish tacos and thought the fish was crispy and that the slaw was nice and crunchy. It was a quality fish taco with great flavor components. My friend ordered the duck confit tacos and thought it was well made. 

Since we were sitting outside on the stools, it was very quick and service was ok. It was also slightly awkward that our view was directly into the kitchen and that they also could stare at us. We will definitely be back but with reservations",2
19890,2,1548979200000,"This Pep Boys has become my go to place for service or parts. After a bad experience at the Lake Mead location, I started taking my business to this location. From the service manager to even the store manager, they go above and beyond, they truly understand customer service. I've gotten tires on three different vehicles here and my experience keeps getting better and better. Even like the last set I had out on my personal vehicle (others have been family members cars), the service manager was able to find a set of 4 in the valley so I could get them same day. At first he believed there were not any in town and offered to have them overnighted out of Los Angeles so I could have them next day but he came through. He called me when they arrived (around 11am, just when he thought they would arrive) and set an appointment for the early afternoon. There was a slight mix up somehow after I dropped off my car but he quickly called me and let me know it would take a little longer then he promised, but I was okay with it. I appreciated the communication and keeping me in the loop. That's what sets this location apart, they keep you informed as to the status. They do have a waiting area in the store but I've yet to take advantage of it as in the same parking lot is a large antique mall and now a couple of smaller ones too so there are a few places to go and check out, the Charleston Antique mall is large enough to spend plenty of time in. 

To include the store manager, there was a time I was looking for an item that was on clearance and she went above and beyond to not only find another store that has it but call over and confirm to save me the trip. I appreciated that too as it shows a professionalism even if it's a low ticket clearance item. All customers matter here regardless of what they are spending.

This hotel is located just off the Las Vegas Strip behind Planet Hollywood and connected to the Miracle Mile shops.  There is no Casino attached but close enough to the strip.  

Overview of our stay:
Checked in at 2pm, a lower floor room was available but we opted to wait longer to get a room on a higher floor.  The room was ready at 3pm, checkin is usually 4pm so we didnt mind.

Took advantage of the Bell Hop service, before we checked in and after we checked out.
The bell hop brought our bags up to our room within 5 mins of calling down.

Free wifi if you are Hilton HHonors member.  Little confusing getting to the login page but it worked eventually. 

(Side Note: If you are planning to stay here, or any hilton hotel I would suggest signing up for HHonors membership, it is free and comes with some nice perks.)

The room was great.  Very clean, great kitchen which we made breakfast on every morning and reheated our leftovers.  The couch in the sitting around was a little worn and had some marks on it but thats my only negative. 

Called down for late check out and was given till 12pm which was even better.

We had a slight leak under our kitchen sink, the maintenance guy who came to fix it was very nice and professional so we wont hold that against them.

My overall impression of the Elara was great.  The staff was very profession and nice, the bed was like sleeping on a cloud and the location is great.

24184,2,1549843200000,"Downtown Las Vegas has another addition with the opening of La Comida, located off of Fremont and Sixth Street.  Mel C. and I were lucky enough to attend the invite-only/soft opening with our amigo Cisco, so I will preface this review by stating that it was definitely not the typical dining experience.  It was a first for me to meet Jenna and Michael Morton, the owners of La Comida, and part of the Morton dynasty - not typical.  I think every employee of La Comida was working last night and the place was bustling with all the excitement and, most likely, nerves that accompany opening a new and much-anticipated hot spot.  There were many Las Vegas celebs and higher-ups there, but I only recognized a few.  What stood out for me was the food and the ambiance.

I had:
La Catrina margarita:  ""Cabrito tequila infused with strawberries, Combier, guava and limes""--so tasty and sweet, but not overly sweet, just the way I like my alcohol when I do drink.  I don't want to taste the alcohol.
Chips and salsa:  The salsa had a little kick, but not too spicy.
Guacamole:  Fresh!
Camaron del Golfo:  ""Gulf shrimp, butternut squash, chorizo, cherry tomatoes, roasted corn, crema de Guajillo""- 3 big grilled shrimp with the other ingredients as a side medley--it was delicious.
Platanos Fritos:  3 fried plantains with vanilla ice cream--a sweet ending to a big meal.

It's exciting to have La Comida in DTLV, making Fremont East an even cooler place to hang out.  Word is that official opening is Thursday, April 25th, so check it out for yourselves--I will definitely be back, too.  

PS - I give the neon monkey sign 5 stars alone--I want one.",1

The restaurant was nicely decorated without being overdone. My daughter has a uniquely gifted palette and seeks out the most interesting beverages.  She was very pleased with the mango lassi. So much so we all ordered one and loved it. We then ordered three entrees. Everything from lamb with spinach, chicken curry to a sample meat dish. Having never experienced Indian food my wife and daughter were pleasantly surprised. The food was wonderful, it literally made all three of us happy. I have cooked for many years and can honesty say food that is well prepared and from the heart has a magical quality. This food we had tonight, had that magic. I also have to mention Amed, I hope I spelled his name right, he was warm and welcoming, very informative. We will definitely be back and will spread the word!

I then proceeded to a special of the night, sausage cornbread, which was very good.  My next selection, which was enough for the whole table, was the animal frites.  French fries covered in gravy, mozzarella cheese, chunk bacon, and 2 fried eggs.  These were my favorite of the night. I decided for my main to get the Fred Flintstone, beef short ribs served on a turkey-sized platter.  A huge portion, with a great reduction sauce. Another person in my party had the pigs head, which was delicious. Definitely unexpected quality of food, would definitely go back when in town!",2

There is a selection of locally grown produce as well as some that are not grown local but either way the comfort of The Apple Factory is hard to match. I have read some reviews that say the location of The Apple Factory is in the sticks..that is not true. It is just off of Bovaird and Mississauga road in Brampton. It does look country from the outside but that is the way one would want their farm stands to look, since fresh produce doesn't necessarily grow in cities. I go usually for lunch and the specials are listed on a chalk board outside the store, then I take a walk around and check out the local items such as salad dressings and bread dippers.

32030,1,1551312000000,"This was my second visit to Mesa Grill. First let me start by saying that we are grilling fools. We grill all year round and have enjoyed Bobby's grilling book as well as Food Network shows. 

The decor is warm and open. The bartender was great and our waitress Tiffany was awesome and attentive. Some of the best service I have ever experienced. This is including the bus boy.

We started with the Prawn Tamale appetizer which was cooked to perfection. The masa corn mix was perfectly flavored.

I ordered the 15 spice chicken with mango salsa. This was tender and a large portion. My sides were mashed potatoes and the blue cheese corn side which was so so so delicious.

I had a view of the kitchen, it was hard for me to tell how the dishes are transfered from the kitchen to the wait staff, it looked confusing to me. Last time we were here something happened and while I was served my pork loin dish after 20 minutes and my hubby was served his steak dish which turned cold. Its almost as if another waiter took my dish for another table at the time and his dish sat awhile.

1) The portion sizes are very small for the price charged per tapa. 
2) This is more French cuisine with a hint of Korean. I was hoping for the other way around! I think there could be more strong Korean influences and flavours, rather than a hint here and there. 

Overall, this was a positive dining experience and some of the best service I have received in awhile...what I ate was tasty but honestly, I did leave craving more - even providing an option or two of a dishes that heartier and more filling as a 'filler' (rice or noodle inspired for example) would be helpful.",1

He gregariously introduced himself to me, plated up some yummy mole and pork chile and invited me to try the food.  Well, it was delicious.  I wanted one of everything.  He said they go to Chicago on Thursdays so the best days to visit La Plaza are Friday, Saturday, and Sundays.  They even sell El Milagro tortillas.  When I lived in Chicago I religiously bought these--they are the best.  When you stop in, meet Robert.  Super great guy and he'll give you a behind-the-ropes experience at La Plaza.  One word:  TACOS!  The taco cart outside is a MUST DO.  Double-layered, warm corn tortillas, fresh cilantro, fresh onion, and any meat from chicken, barbacoa, carnitas, carne asada, and some veggie mix.  Downright delicious.  Any only $2 per taco.

There was only 2 people working at the time. So instead I went to the local Terribles and paid $10 more but was out in 20 minutes with a free car wash, so it was pretty much the same. While I was checking out for my oil change the lady at Terribles mentioned that I needed a new fuel filter but she was out of stock and could have it the next day. The price would be $39.99 installed. I asked if I could do it the following oil change and she said yes, so I waited. The other day my check engine light went on and when I had it checked I was informed the problem was my fuel filter. I called Firestone as it is literally 3 blocks from my house and was told by Brian it would be $120. $15 for the filter and 94 for labor plus tax. When I asked why it was 3 times as much as terrible he could not give me an answer. Conveniently the manager Henry was not around and he did not have the phone number for Andy the Area Manager. I have been coming to this store since the day they opened and have other issues with them. They have changed managers and staff numerous times over the last 2 years and each time it seems to get worse.

And, this resulted in additional expenses to us which she has failed to take any financial responsibility for, despite her promises.

At the time, they only served their Rock Lobster ROll and Lobster Cappuccino (which can be found on their current menu). Having been won over at TUM, I vowed to support their establishment once they opened.

Must Try's: Crispy Maple Pork Belly & Rock Lobster Roll. They're so good, one might even fancy ordering it twice (I know I'm guilty of that). 

Crispy Maple Pork Belly is exactly as it's named and ten times as delicious sounds. The pork belly is perfectly crisp and mixed brilliant with their secret maple sauce. The creamed spinach served with it is fantastic. 

Rock Lobster Roll is, I'm scared to say, one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. I've tried and tasted many other creations in Toronto, but none compare to Rock Lobster. The bread bun is toasted with a garlic spread, and the lobster filling is generous to say the least. 

To top it off the $1/oz Cabernet Franc is a great deal, and a perfect accompaniment to the entire meal.

Other notable mentions include: Lobster Mac & Cheese and Lobster Poutine. Both delicious in their own rights, but come in a close second to the dishes noted above.

Sorry to be such a snob but truly this food was just okay. If you're a foodie and really know great Ethiopian I would suggest you don't eat here. while the wait staff are really wonderful the food was just okay, presentation is nothing like usual Ethiopian fare (family style). The Dobo Wat was ordinary and my favorite (Gomen) was tasteless. they didn't include that grumbly cheese and my Doro didn't have the typical egg. The sauce lacked flavor.",3
32643,2,1549411200000,"My friend and I went here for lunch. 
We ended up both having the three course express lunch menu ($22). As other reviewers have noted, the menu here is VERY limited. 

Course 1 - Pacific Green Salad. Was fine, nothing special. 
Course 2 - Duck Confit Sandwich. This pulled duck sandwich was quite tasty, but could have been a lot more. It was on a plain hamburger bun placed in the middle of a large plate with nothing else. Presentation left a lot to be desired. On top of that, my friend found pieces of bone in her duck! 
Course 3 - Ice Cream/Sorbet. Was one scoop of vanilla bean ice cream (nice) and one scoop of cucumber orange sorbet (not tasty). 

With so many other places to go for lunch in the downtown core, I won't be rushing back here.",2

The chickpea sauce has a nice little kick but the harissa delivers a little after burn which is pleasant without being overbearing. The staff is very nice. The only negative is visiting on a cold day, the place is quite chilly and each time the door opens it becomes worse. I prefer to eat with my coat off so next time I will go when it is not snowing.

But the rice (which is a side option even for the vegetarian combos) is not vegetarian. It's made with chicken broth. They assured us the beans are vegetarian.

It's in a strip mall along with a Drug Mart, a small grill/pub and - that's all. The rest of the bldg. Is actually being demolished. Hope this place lasts.",2

The equipment is modest.  Conspicuous by its absence was a concept 2 rowing erg, my current cardio of choice.  They have the standard treadmills, bikes, ellipticals though.

Good selection of heavy kettlebells in the upper mezzanine area, something I dearly miss in my home Anytime in Tucson AZ.  That area is pretty cluttered with gear though, they must be pretty constrained by space.

The dreams lovingly planted at the Enigma Garden Cafe (rest in peace you place of eternal awesomeness, you. can I get an amen, anyone?) are finally starting to take seed.

The Arts Factory has been the hub of First Friday - the city sponsored art event held, imaginatively enough, on the first Friday of every month - for the past threeish (fourish?, it all blends) years.  Housing something like 16 galleries, with performance space and areas outside to set up MORE art, there's more mixed media here than you can shake a pretentious art school student at.  Local and national artists display and sell their wares, and with a selection as vast as this you're bound to find SOMETHING you like.

Tinoco's Bistro is also housed in the factory, serving up some delicious Italian meals (be sure to make reservations in First Friday) and a band is almost always playing on their patio.

Sometimes maligned for its recent involvement in some arts scene drama (ooooh, drama!), the Arts Factory remains a viable, vital and important part of our art scene.  Check it, and First Friday, out.",2

The noodles surprisingly came on a huge plate again with lots of veggies, and tasted okay. I prefer the smaller portion from Asian legend which comes with thicker sauce, more meat and bean curd but my husband disagrees.

34867,1,1550361600000,"The night before going to Montreal, I had this dream.  I imagined I was in some frou-frou restaurant with all sharp angles, low lights and distressed wood, being given a rundown of the current local pre-fixe menu in what my unconscious mind conceived of as a Quebecois accent (i.e. French with an occasional ""aboot"" mixed in).  The food was meticulously assembled and delicious in a new and unconventional way.

Little did I know that the next day all my dreams would come true.  Except the accent.  It's basically just French.

Candide is set in the basement of an old church, which immediately puts it in legendary status for hipsterism.  Add to that some unfinished wood patios, and simple, vaguely rustic decor and you have the perfect setting for what comes next.  And that is a 2.5 hour pre fixe meal where you watch the chef himself make each one of your dishes not a couple feet from your table and then bring each one to you, along with an explanation peppered with weird ingredients.

Each dish was a collection of interesting flavors from local ingredients.  Mussels with some kind of peppery crisp on top, curls of rutabaga with fried parsnip and probably the best piece of pork I've ever met.  My impression of French cuisine is that they do fairly simple preparations with an attention to detail bordering on obsessive.  That's the impression I got here.  I'm not usually one for flowery arrangements of vegetation on my dishes, but the design and the taste was really in sync here.

Don't miss it!",2

The place has a really cool vibe; great music, staff is totally chill, decor is great.  Had a bloody mary to start and it was DELICIOUS.  Not from a mix, perfect ratio of vodka and was just tasty.  You must must must order the short rib hash with demi glace.  It was so good all I did was sit at the table, eat and nod my head the entire time.  My daughter ordered the breakfast tacos and the meat was perfect.  A great sweet addition?  The monkey bread.

They had a lot of Four Peaks beers, and food so what else do I need? On and growler refills. On my last visit I sampled the Odelay Mexican chocolate ale. At 8.1% it packed a punch!

For another sample I had a cask dry hopped blonde. I hate blonde beers, but this one was actually good.  I'm a huge fan of cask beer and four peaks seems to have many. That's a real good thing. 

Out of the two I took home a growler of the Odelay. 

We didn't have a chance to eat any food. I did like the decor of the bar, has a lot of bar space and a nice sized patio. I'd like to try out the food next time.

Yesterday, after my usual workout, I went to collect my membership card (because they're so ghetto you have to leave your card at the front desk and retrieve it on your way out once you get the attention of the girl reading the latest facebook status updates) and was told ""you can't come here anymore"".
""But why??"" was my natural response. I've never defaulted on my payments. I respect the shitty equipment and wipe them down after. It's all because I joined at the Dufferin location over TWO years ago. I don't live anywhere close to there now and I've been consistently using the Peter Street location for a long time. 
Apparently, they're behaving like children and have a squabble because Peter is giving the Duff a bad rep. So who suffers? The customer of course! Peter has decided to break away and now your Fitness One membership is no longer valid there yet according to their website, it looks like they're still part of the same company. 
I emailed the Peter location but judging by all the vitriolic comments I've seen on the web, I'm sure I'll never get a response. 
They said I could cancel my membership at the Duff (and I have to go in person. How convenient!) and then they'll ""kindly"" waive the joining fees at the Peter location and ""kindly"" charge me double the amount I'm paying now (all under the guise that the reason why they're more expensive is because of their central location - maybe if you offered better equipment and turn down that shitty music, I'd be willing to pay more). I know it's not expensive but it's the principle that's pissing me off. 
My friend went through a whole mess of trying to cancel her membership and got charged a lot for it. 
My guess is I will continue to get charged on my credit card long after I've quit the other location because Fitness One is the best at giving a good rim job. 
So even if you don't read my long rant PAY HEED TO THIS: DO NOT JOIN FITNESS ONE!! THEY'RE SCAMMERS!!!!!",3

You get served some complimentary carbs to start--coffee cakes, jalapeno bread, blue cornbread, etc. The fresh-squeezed orange juice was delightful. Blue corn-crusted halibut was simple and great. Clean taste with a bit of a kick. Capers and grape tomatoes in the sauce. Mmm... the boy ordered goat cheese and jalapeno scrambled eggs with honey ham. The ham was very juicy and soft.

The entire meal, all my bf and I could say is ""that's interesting."" Such an interesting mix of flavors all around, which I guess is expected of this kind of restaurant. The service was great. I think the brunch menu is rather simple, so in reality I'm giving 3.5 stars (rounding up because it was a pleasant meal all around) but I'd definitely like to try their lunch and/or dinner menu, which is probably more of an experience.",1

My fiance and I love going here for lunch during the week or on weekends for happy hour. They serve $5 wines and $5 pitchers until 5pm every day, but there are no food specials that I know of. 

The salads are hearty, though not huge. They make their soups fresh and the ones I've had have been very good. My fiance likes the BBQ pork ribs, and I mix it up. The lobstah roll and fish sammich are yummy. If you go here and neglect to order the church potatoes as a side....just don't.

I want to like this place- it has a great aesthetic, I love the garage door style windows that can open up and really ventilate the place and allow you to enjoy the outside even though they don't have a patio, and the bank vault downstairs is fun. 
I've been here for drinks a few times, and the drinks are awesome. They change up their cocktail menu fairly frequently, and I haven't had a bad one yet. The tap list is usually interesting and they have a few decent wines.
I don't think I'll be coming back for food though. I ate at Lucille this summer and everything save my one cocktail was disappointing. And, I actually ordered a second cocktail, but it never came to the table, although they did try to charge me for it at the end of the meal.
We had two appetizers to start. The cheese curds were decent. The Artichoke dip app was sad; the dip itself tasted fine even though it wasn't quite hot, but the tortilla chips served with it were downright inedible. They had seemingly been cooked in cold oil, absorbing the poor quality (maybe old) oil making them soft in some places, greasy all over and tasting very stale. 
We had a Detroit style pizza that was very lack luster. I mean, it's pizza, so it was edible, but it's not something I would choose to eat again. The crust was kinda chewy, but not in a good way. The cheese was very bland, they would be better off using Wisconsin brick cheese- higher fat content and more flavor than mozzarella. Sauce was unremarkable. The toppings were fresh and good though.
Service over all was poor. I try to give waitstaff the benefit of the doubt, I don't know everything that's happening in the restaurant while I'm there, but I barely saw her unless she was walking quickly past my table without even glancing our way.

It is incredibly creamy and rich, and when they have mixed in ingredients (think cookie-dough), there is PLENTY, usually at least a piece in every bite. When I lived less than a mile from this place, I ate there at least weekly (and gained a few pounds - thanks!). Even though I've moved a bit, I still make the effort to stop by. On Tuesdays they have dollar off quarts and pints (BEST deal!). My favorite flavors include Birthday Cake (can't beat the icing swirl), Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie (SO rich!), and Graham Central Station (there are bits of something like pie crust in it!). Additionally, the employees seem to be incredibly happy at all of the locations I've been. They are very prompt in their service and happy to give you as many samples as you'd like. If you're near a Handels, do yourself a solid and stop by to have an Ice Cream Experience!",2

The meat is cooked well (don't know why the carver kept refusing to give me the rarer pieces). Some of the steaks ended up being dry. 
The skirt steak was awesomely seasoned, and the salad bar is AWESOME.

Their Siam Duck, Teriyaki Beef, Green papaya salad, beef salad, and fried banana are all my favorites just to name a few.
But I am having problem with the variation of the services I received there. They are mostly decent, but I had a very bad experience with one of the waitress when I visited last time. It was an early evening and we were the only one there when we first walked in. Two other groups came in after us shortly. While we were waiting to get our menu, the other two groups already got their drinks and placed their orders. We asked if we can be helped to place our order, we were neglected and ignored. I am not sure if it's language barrier problem, but it feels like she was yelling at us when we were wondering why we haven't been helped. We end up walking out there empty stomached. 
Again, since I have been going there for so long and liked it so much, I don't want to give it a bad review. So I took two stars off the five stars that I would give them just for the food. Hope the services improve soon!",3

Upon check in I was upgraded to the club floor with my SPG and excited to see what an awesome view my room included! Everything seemed clean and well appointed. Unfortunately there was construction going on two rooms away and I watched a guy using a jack hammer for hours making an incredible amount of noise. This made it hard to work in my room so I went to the club lounge, where jerry springer was on ridiculously loud. No remote in sight so I called the desk and they said someone would come up. That never happened. Other than that frustrating part, I felt like employees cared and offered help when possible. For instance in the social restaurant in the lobby I had an amazing burger for lunch in day 1. On day 2 I went back and they only offered an ""express menu"" that offered a frozen pizza for $10 or a hot dog (and a few other choices). I mentioned my disappointment in not having the burger available so they made it for me anyway. That was so kind! It was just as tasty on day 2.

Highly anticipating the short ribs smoked pastrami style was not what we expected at all.  Meat was dry and over-seasoned.

22124,1,1549929600000,"I didn't bother looking up Cafe Maurizio on Yelp before coming since I came here and I hadn't heard much about it before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  Having seen the rating for this restaurant now though I have to say that I agree with it.   The location is excellent being right on Saint Laurent just north of Sherbrooke but everything else left me feeling underwhelmed.

I came here for a special event and since we were a large group we got a special deal which for $21 got each person an antipasto, choice of pizza and dessert.  To make things easier they asked that everyone pay cash beforehand and after tip and taxes it was $27.  Alcohol was not included in this.

The service was quite spotty.  I get that we were a fairly large group (20+ people) but a reservation had been made well in advance so they should have accounted for this.  Some people only received their pizzas after everyone else had finished theirs and my pizza was quite tepid when I received it.  It was also quite difficult to get the waiter's attention so that I could order wine.  Basically anyone who wanted wine had to flag down the server to when this is something they should have come around to ask if we wanted any.

The food itself was also kind of lacklustre.  The antipasto was a mix of items like bocconcini, melanzane (eggplant) and prosciutto and that was pretty good.  After that though the rest of the meal went downhill.  As I mentioned before my pizza was lukewarm at best when I received it.  Even if it had been served hot it wouldn't have been the greatest.  I had the Latina which came with rapini and sausage.  The rapini had no flavour to it and was very mushy so it was probably overcooked.  The cheese they used was of low quality and the crust was too dense and not cooked very well.  I'm of the opinion that the best pizzas are made in wood-burning ovens as it gives the crust a smokey flavour that can't be reproduced in an electric oven.  Dessert was a pastel de nata which was a little surprising considering it was supposed to be an Italian restaurant.  It tasted okay but certainly not one of the best that I have had.",2

23692,3,1550880000000,"After living in Vegas for over 8 years (including living next door), I finally decided to try Lawry's.  It had been over three decades since I was at one (in LA) and I distinctively remembered the very comfortable atmosphere, the carts and carvers, the great service and the overall pleasant (and more upscale - white tableclothes) ambiance of the place.

Some traditions don't die, and it was nice to see Lawry's maintain its brand it has had for these past decades.   I do like that it was easy to have a conversation at our table at a normal level without tons of ambient noise from other tables and from music.

Briefly, service was excellent - very experienced, efficient and polished wait staff and assistants, comfortable seating (not all jammed in there, despite the busy-ness of the place), those large polished carts, and a cordial hostess and greeter.

As to the food:  I wasn't really impressed at all by the spinning salad - unique presentation, but dressing tasted like a mix between water-down french and thousand island, the fresh bread was tasty but would have been better with real butter instead of whipped, the creamed spinach was definitely a pass (dried out, small portion and only moderately tasty), the yorkshire pudding was ......., well don't have a reference point for that but wasn't terribly memorable but a nice touch.  Mashed potatoes and gravy were good (a bit on the salty side).  Lastly, the prime rib - traditional cut/end cut - was terrific!!!!  Probably the most tender prime rib (and for an end cut) I have tasted, and certainly that alone is worth going back.   Before we were served, I questioned why we all didn't receive sharper steak knives - I now understand that sharp knives are necessary for what we had ordered.   Our group didn't try any other meat dish, so no comment on those.

I was in Vegas with my girlfriend who had been there for a company conference, it so happened to also be my birthday weekend and I wanted an amazing meal on my Birthday before we headed back to LA. Mastro's had always been well recommended by friends and family so i was excited to have a birthday meal there. We have a few locations in the Los Angeles area but never had a opportunity to dine at one. 

We arrived a few minutes after opening and were seated promptly, our server (I forget his name :( so sorry) was amazing! Was very informative and accommodating. My girlfriend ordered the chilean sea bass and one prawn. I had the bone in rib eye steak and we shared a side of green beans and asparagus. My girlfriend ordered a delicious drink and while I couldn't decide on what to have myself our waiter brought out a amazing whiskey drink for me. 

Once the food arrived it all looked so yummy, and here is when the problems began. I had ordered my steak medium rare, when I cut into the steak it was more medium / medium well. I thought maybe it was just the surrounding edges that were overcooked because that tends to happen with rib eye steaks. Once I cut closer to the bone it was evident it was overcooked. I called over the waiter and quickly had my steak sent back and a new one was on its way out. My girlfriends sea bass was amazing but the prawn she ordered was overcooked. While I waited for my replacement steak to arrive the manager came to our table to offer their apologies which was much appreciated. My replacement steak took quite some time enough time for my girlfriend to finish her meal while I sat there waiting for my food. 

Once my new steak arrived I was eager to eat, the manager had them bring out fresh new sides which was unexpected but very appreciated. Manager had me cut into the steak to see if it was cooked properly and sadly it was also overcooked. I was disappointed and as I cut further in to check the center of the steak it was evident this steak was overcooked as well as chewy. The manager acknowledged it was overcooked and offered a replacement but at this point I just wanted to eat! I told him it was ok and that I would finish my steak and be on our way, needless to say my steak was comped. A few minutes into my second steak the manager let me know that they had another steak for me and I should slow down on finishing this one. I advised him I had no desire for a third steak and that there was no way I could finish it but he insisted.

My third steak was brought out and my second was taken away, again the manager asked me to check the cook on this third steak. Upon cutting into the steak it was raw, very raw...almost a blue steak. I was really disappointed at this point and the manager just walked away. Our server came to our table and asked me ""Do you like your steak like that?"" acknowledging how undercooked it was. At this point I was so upset that I just wanted to eat but could only finish a few extra bites. The manager brought out a free dessert with Happy Birthday written on the dish which was freaking delicious. The customer service is is really fantastic I can't stress that enough. Drinks are fantastic and the wait staff is top notch! And the steak was fantastic the next day when I had to for lunch and was reheated to a proper temp ;) 

I'll definitely return here for a second meal regardless of all the problems I experienced as I truly believe they deserve a second chance and I'll update my review accordingly.

First off, they respected my property and covered my floors and stairs. They put on booties. I'd just finished a remodel (new purchase). They diagnosed something everyone else had missed. My systems (inside=air handler and outside=condenser) were mismatched and causing havoc. This wasn't great news for me, as mismatches aren't covered, but they researched and found some options. Justin really was patient with my questions and I had a lot of them. I appreciated having options. There was some misunderstanding that led to a delay in installation, but even that was handled in a very straight forward manner. The person that was responsible actually took responsibility and apologized. REFRESHING. When the installation took place, it was a new, third crew. Matt V and Ric D were also extremely patient as I questioned every step of the process before they started. I told them my understanding of what was to happen and it did not match theirs, so they called in to clarify (also refreshing, didn't automatically assume I was wrong). No one was upset that I questioned what was happening. Extremely patient and never with that snarky, condescending thing some trades people do if a woman/client questions what they are doing. All of the teams that came out were friendly, knowledgeable, competent and easy to work with. Things did not go perfectly, but I would work with this company again. I always got a call that they were on their way, or just finishing up. My property looked like they'd never been there when they finished. The original first opinion company that came out was competent (ish), but slovenly and damaged my paint and acted like this was just part of the process. They also had 3 different techs out.

39527,1,1549324800000,"After much debate and obsession, I ended up choosing Palms Place as the hotel to take my son to Vegas for his 21st birthday.  He thought we were spending the whole week in San Diego (took him there for a Chargers game), and got very excited when I finally told him we were going to Vegas.  I did manage to keep the hotel a secret until we actually pulled up to the valet.  I chose Palms Place based on reviews and videos on youtube.  Based on the ""wow"" factor when we walked into the room, I would have to say I chose wisely.

Check in was swift, informative, and pleasant.  Matt was a great ambassador for Palms Place, making us, and especially my son, feel very welcome and special.  After talking to him about how and why we ended up at Palms Place, Matt said as a 21st birthday gift, he had upgraded us to a higher floor and strip view.  Granted, the hotel was not busy, but the gesture was greatly appreciated and made a fabulous room even better.  Ended up scoring a corner suite on the 28th floor.

I booked the 1 bedroom suite, which is HUGE.  These are ""condos"" that were offered for sale at one point, but now are rented out as rooms.  This place had everything:  full kitchen with state of the art appliances, living room w/fireplace, fold out sleeper sofa, tv, desk, easy chairs, and awesome lighting, washer/dryer, 1/2 bath, full bath with dual sinks and HUGE 3 head shower, and king size bedroom with flat screen tv, lots of storage, big jacuzzi tub, and a balcony overlooking the strip.  This is the kind of room you almost feel bad leaving because it is just so damn nice.  The strip view was amazing, and at night it was even better.

There is a motorized, enclosed walkway from the Palms Place hotel area to the Palms Casino area.  The casino was never overly busy and in my humble opinion one of the nicer, cleaner, and modern casinos in Vegas.  Not a huge gambler, but the slots at the Palms were loose and had some good promos with the player's club.  

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to quote the rate I paid for this room, so I will just say that I got an INCREDIBLE deal and it also included a $25 food/bev credit.  Sure, we could have stayed on the Strip for cheaper, but I have NO regrets over my choice.  I am sure the week before Christmas was the biggest factor in getting such a great deal and also the reason we didn't have crowds to deal with.  We loved the location, the atmosphere, the amenities, and the service.

To sum things up, if you want a great room with awesome extras and don't mind staying off the strip, Palms Place is ideal for you.  If you want the hustle and bustle of the strip and all you want the room for is somewhere to crash, I would advise staying elsewhere, but remember, ""you get what you pay for"".

P.S.  There is a ""resort fee"", but if you have done your homework, you already know that and it won't make a difference on choosing to stay here.",1

My wife and I wanted to lease a Hyundai Genesis 5.0 Ultimate, as the lease on our Lexus was set to end. The Internet manager told me they had one in stock and he knew on Thursday that I would be in to test drive it on Saturday.

When we arrived we discovered that no one was aware we were coming. We later also found out they didn't even have a car like the one we wanted on the lot! We were being helped by two idiots who let us test drive the filthiest Genesis in town... the thing must have had a few thousand miles on it.

After the test drive we headed for the car, as I was DONE!

At that point the manager rushes up to our car and begs us not to leave. I told them to call me when they get their act together. This guy was so desperate that my wife felt sorry for him and talked me into going back into that hell house.

Long story short, this lying jerk promised to get the car we wanted from another dealership, and for the price we wanted, but only if we showed that we were serious by leaving a down payment. I had my reservations but he promised they could get the car in 4-days, he even handed me a printout of the car's VIN number.

We had two different types of chicken on a stick, however, they were both very average. The menu is pretty extensive and there are plenty of options available.

The reason why I'm not giving them a 5 star is because of the service, even though the waiter was courteous he gave us misleading information, I asked him if the dessert was included and he said ""yes""so we ordered the options given, he even went as far as to decline my request for a different dessert that wasn't part of the deal, so I clearly recall sticking to their options to not go over budget since we had already ordered a bottle of wine ( which was half price according to them, now I'm wondering if we got scammed into that one)

45768,3,1549065600000,"One of the many indulgences of La Vegas. Mastro's is a well known stop for those looking to treat themselves. 
Food: We went as a group of 7 girls and all got steak with a variety of shared sides. I split a 16oz filet made medium (almost half the price it would cost to get an 8 oz filet on your own). It was everything I expected from a good steakhouse, well seasoned, tender, and perfectly cooked. Its only dressing was a melting slice of butter on the top. The sides were all generally well made. The lobster mashed potatoes had real chunks of lobster it in, though, between the 7 of us, not everyone got a piece. The brussel sprouts and asparagus were cooked to just the right texture but there was nothing really special about them. The creamed corn was sweet and luxuriously smooth but needed a little more savory to balance it out. 
Service: The service was excellent. The server was very accommodating and attentive. A few of us ordered steaks to split and they plated them separately for us. We also brought in our own cake since we were celebrating a birthday. They served the caked and repacked the leftover cake for us to go. 
Locations: Mastro's unique architecture has made it a near icon among the casinos on the strip. Floating in the middle of Crystals, it makes up a beautiful view and provides one. The decor is subdued in an elegant way and it generally draws a quieter crowd.    
While Mastro's wasn't a life changing dining experience, between the high class menu and eye catching locale, it certainly did not disappoint.",2

My wife had the California Cut, while I ordered the Lawry's Cut.  Both Prime Ribs were cooked perfectly.  We also enjoyed a side of the Sizzling Skillet Mushrooms and my wife also got the creamed spinach.  Together with the Yorkshire Pudding and Mashed Potatoes, it made for a very delicious meal.

Like the tiniest crab leg on the knuckle too. Someone else rated this as an upscale olive garden. I'd consider the Olive Garden a step up in flavor. Did I mention it was super plain?

The chicken was at least a large portion. The small potatoes were the best thing on the plate. The skin was thin and crunchy. Underneath the meat was overcooked and somewhat dry. If you want chicken, I'd save yourself 20 dollars and get some KFC.",1

But since my friend and I went yesterday (Wednesday) there weren't too many people so we found a seat and ordered our drinks.  I got a Rising Sun  which was good - it's probably my fault that it wasn't great b/c I'm not a big whiskey fan and there was whiskey in it, so I was nursing it and didn't finish it.  It had a good flavor but I kept tasting the whiskey which made it hard to swallow.  We also ordered some fries - which were fresh and well seasoned.

39565,3,1550620800000,"Food- I give this place a 5 star for its food for sure!!! Fresh Italian food that tastes amazing!!! Ordered the caprese salad, the rolled ham and cheese appetizers (forgot what it's called), and 2 pizzas including the marghareta pizza with arugula added and the diavola. AMAZING. highly recommend all. By far the best tasting caprese salad that doesn't shy down on its portions or cheese slices. Fresh and light. The pizzas were done quite quickly maybe about a 10 or so minute wait. Would need a fork and a knife to cut into it because the toppings weigh down the bread a bit. Crust/appetizers/bread is very very good with the hot garlic sauce provided. If I could buy it I would! If you're not a fan of hot it might come off as really spicy. But the flavour is strong and works well with the breads for sure! Bread is fresh, with a perfect crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. 

Price- fairly priced! About $12-25 dishes. Nothing heavy on the pocket. 

Service & environment- Amazing. Waitress kept checking up on us, let us sit near the tv to watch the Jays game. Made sure our water jug was never empty. Accommodated us really well! Environment was a quiet ambience with dim lights (on a Sunday night). Family friendly.

29150,1,1550448000000,"I'm hoping that those that read this are people that have never tried this place and also have never had ""Ohio-style"" pizza and are wondering what that's all about. First of all, let's not kid ourselves here, this place is a chain restaurant like Pizza Hut or Dominoes. Yes, there's only one here in the south, but they have over 40 locations in Ohio (hence the Ohio-style). So, going into it, expect chain restaurant quality. Now, let's get to the Ohio-style part. I wanted to go into trying this place and reviewing it without any other bias other than they got pretty significant amount of good reviews here on Yelp. I figured I'd let the stars speak for themselves. That was a mistake. You see, Ohio-style pizza is one of those things where if you didn't grow up with it, there's a good chance it will be nothing like anything else you've ever had and you may also not like it a lot. I grew up near Ohio and never had Ohio-style pizza, but that shouldn't change my opinion of good pizza, right? That's what I figured going into this. But after trying it, I had to go back and read all of the other reviews to see why this place gets such good reviews. Well, a good portion of those reviews are from people that grew up in Ohio and miss this style, because it's not available down here. If you read the other reviews that explain it, you don't need my description, but if you want it, here it goes. It has a Pizza Hut pan pizza type buttery crust that's not quite cooked all the way, so it's flimsy and not fully crispy. It does have crispy parts, like the edges, but under the middle of my pizza was soggy. They load the sauce on and it is sweet, a little too sweet I feel. I got a 12 inch and I imagine they used two full ladles of sauce on this thing, because there were areas that it was over a half inch deep in sauce. If you're a fan of pizza at most other places, you'll think the next step is the cheese and you'd be wrong. They don't have toppings at this place. They have, what I call, bottomings. All of the toppings are under the cheese. Toppings under the cheese, especially pepperoni, is pizza sacrilege to me. Pepperoni needs to cook and get slightly crispy (and on some pizzas, slightly burned). When you put pepperoni under the cheese, not only does it not cook, it just sweats it's grease into the crust, which is exactly what happened to my pizza. The underside was a hand-soaking greasy mess. I think they use the toppings under the cheese to make the cheese grip the crust a little better, because in areas where the topping were lacking, the cheese just slid right off leaving a saucy, greasy mess. I could be wrong, but the only way I'd ever know is if I ordered a no-topping cheese pizza and that just ain't happening. I also got onions and sausage. I'm not going to say their toppings quality is great, but it doesn't suck, except for maybe the pepperoni, but that's only because I didn't get the fully-cooked flavor potential of it. The outer edges of the crust were not too bad. I felt that if the rest of the crust had been cooked to the same texture or done-ness, perhaps this would have been a better experience for me. But, the way I feel about pizza is (especially in the case of a chain restaurant where everything is done by specific procedure), its not difficult to make it good, so you only get one shot with me. Maybe they were having a bad day, but honestly I don't care. There's a lot of other pizza around here if you're willing to drive a little. So, I ate two slices of it, then just the sausage from a couple more, then the outer crust from two more slices. The rest went into the garbage. I will never order this again and if you're not from Ohio and are curious about this place, use extreme caution and don't expect it to be as good as these other Ohioan reviewers are saying it is.

When you walk up the stairs to this mid-level dining room, you'll immediately notice the high-quality, dense wood assembled bench/pic nic seating and tables. It's like a mess hall but much nicer and with way better quality food. There is a wide variety of different sausages of course (you may have guessed from the name :D). This is not your frozen meat section at Safeway, this isn't even the counter st your favorite butcher shop, this is made-in-house homemade not from a supplier legit you won't find it anywhere else sausages, and the quality is very freakin' good! They let you choose everything from how its dressed, to the bun to sides and how it's cooked, and then you choose the drink to go along with it. For those who need to drive afterwards, there's a good supply of Italian soda and flavored waters and juices on hand, and for those who's palate is in need of some fresh suds, the aforementioned beer list is there for your continued enjoyment. There's not much to complain about in regards to the beer, the only thing I would warn newcomers of is that scattered throughout the list are some rare and imported selections which can go as high as $40-80, if memory serves correctly. Should you not be careful, you may order one by accident and be very surprised when the bill arrives (although I am fairly certain the staff would advise you of such a thing happening should you do so accidentally).

Food is served pretty quickly, staff is friendly. The clientele ranges from Queen West hipsters, to 20 something aspiring models and Bay Street types. This tells you something: No matter who you are, they all flock here for the food!

49319,2,1551225600000,"Joe's Farm Grill is very different from the original Joe's Restaurant, ""Joe's Real BBQ.""  For one thing, the decor is more modern, with a family bent.  

This restaurant is situated on a real farm.  Well it used to be a lot bigger. There are fields and gardens in the back.  There's a huge grassy area with lots of trees, benches and shady spots so families can bring their kids and let them run and play while they eat.   Families with young kids seem to enjoy it here.

I ordered the Fontina Burger with Sweet Potato Fries.  Note the burger runs about $7.99 and includes fries.  To get Sweet potato, you need to pay a $2.00 upgrade fee.

The burger was huge- 1/3 pound!  It was not a shriveled, dry, meat patty that you would find somewhere else. Definitely low fat content, moist and flavorful.  I loved the veggies on top, grilled mushrooms, roasted red peppers, homemade pesto, and fresh greens.  And the cheese was just the right flavor for the veggies.  I also added a multi grain bun which was just right.

Of course the sweet potato fries were awesome.  They came with a pineapple-serrano dipping sauce which was not needed.  These fries have enough flavor on their own.

Fresh food, fresh taste, homemade goodness!  Try Joe's Farm Grill!

The space was a little hard to find as it is in the back of a building that faces 7th (awe parked out front where there were some businesses still being built, but there is a huge lot in back). The restaurant is decorated nicely and has a 'cool' modern feel.  I went with a friend for happy hour and we went a little crazy with ordering. They have so many drinks on special, it was easy to find something that sounded delicious. I tried the okra cup and the cobbler... both were incredibly tasty and strong! I definitely felt them afterwards. We shared some food - the marinara focaccia, wings, Calabrian pork bites, and the biscuit donut. The pork bites came out first and were just ridiculously delish... little pieces of pork belly with a bit of a tang and a hint of spiciness... the portion was small, but the flavor was huge. The huge pile of wings were also wonderful.... they are smoked, which was a bit weird at first, but as we ate them we liked them more and more. The wings came with a 'white' bbq sauce.... I don't know what this was, but it was like crack.... so tasty. In fact, the white sauce and the hot sauce on the table really saved the focaccia, which was nothing special ( but tasted good when you added the sauces). The donut was tasty, but didn't taste much like biscuit... still good though. I will definitely be back, I want to try the Tennessee hot chicken... yum.

I was immediately blown away by the attention to detail put into the decorations inside the restaurant! I was able to get a spot in the high ceiling section, which offered lots of natural light. There are swings in the back which you can relax in, and lots of tables. 

I tried: 

- The waffle: this was made with a vegan yogurt sauce, with chia gel and fresh fruits! It was quite a good portion size, and came with sufficient yogurt sauce (that was minimally sweet, but rather tart), and lots of fresh fruits. The chia gel definitely helped to fill me up! This wasn't too sweet overall, and felt very healthy. 

- The lumberjack: made with breakfast potatoes, lentils, fennel, dill, vegan smoked onion sausage, and caper aioli - this was a really good choice for a savoury dish; I was pleasantly surprised at how real the texture of the sausage was (given that I'm not a vegetarian), and it had a good smoky flavour. What really made this dish stand out was the copious amounts of savory sauce that had caper aioli; I kept wanting to dunk the potatoes into it! I even ended up dunking some of the waffle pieces into the sauce. Really satisfying!

- Coffee - cappuccino:  this came quickly and was strong. Perfect way to give a burst of energy for the afternoon! 

Service was attentive but maybe a bit slow at the end. I relaxed by hanging out in the hanging chairs at the back of the store before heading out for more shopping! The restrooms are also unique and very clean/cozy. Although I was full, I could have been more full...but it was an interesting experience!",2

The reason for three stars, though, is because of how annoying the business model of some of these craft burger places are. We get it, your burgers are far superior than the concoction that McDonald's passes off as a burger, and 90% of the people coming here are fully willing to pay $10-$15 for a burger and fries meal (I certainly am). The problem is always the portion size. If you lift, workout, or are anything but paper-thin good luck getting full off of these portions. Why not charge a little more and provide normal portions?

I do believe that the place had an option to add an extra patty, but that really does not help since, unless you have eaten here before, you have no clue how big/small the burger by itself is. Why would I order an extra patty just in case?

- food was fine with definite potential for being really good.

on the negative side:
- big TV over the bar instantly communicates this is not a nice restaurant. Maybe it turns into a bar atmosphere later in the evening?

- super limited menu. a handful of pizzas, a handful of pastas. someone put all of their energy into an overpriced wine list.
- the signature pizza that everyone loves so much literally has a handful of arugula dropped on top of it. As if someone spilled it. My guy was also displeased with all the charring. its supposed to be wood-burning oven, not wood-burned pizza, right?

As I've mentioned in my review of A Cookie and a Cupcake, I usually prefer the sugary frosting to the smooth buttercream. Not here. Yeeeccckk! It was too sugary and hard. It was also disproportionate to the cupcake and fell off almost immediately.

I sampled four cupcakes (and felt like one of the cool kids for getting there before they sold out): chocolate chip, vanilla, chocolate raspberry, and cookies and cream. I'd say the cookies and cream was the best, followed by chocolate chip, chocolate raspberry, and poor vanilla came last. First of all, the vanilla cake is too spongy and too sweet. Then the vanilla frosting is just awful. I mean, not TRULY awful but only in the way a cupcake can actually be awful. Soo sweet and had this weird texture. The chocolate frosting was great. The chocolate cake was also great. So next time I'll probably try the chocolate cupcake, which has the best combination of cake and frosting. I agree with Krystal that the cookies and cream frosting was amazing. Unlike her, though, mine was on a chocolate cupcake, which I'm sure made it infinitely better.

They were pretty friendly in there, but not genuinely so, more like ""Hi! Our cupcakes rule! You are LUCKY to be here!"" etc. Like the cupcakes themselves, too sweet to be taken seriously.",2

We were seated 60 minutes later but a booth and large table remained empty but was not bussed for nearly 30 minutes.  The biggest disappointment was the bartender who served us one round of beer as we waited for the table but never checked back with us - he did manage to keep his own drink filled however.  Finally we were seated we immediately handed our server our menus and waited for close to an hour for the food with only once being checked on if we needed anything.  Another major disappointment we were not provided peanuts or asked if we wanted peanuts...

44979,3,1549929600000,"There are only five reasons to ever, ever go here, and even those are stretching it. Malls in general are despicable places and this one tops the list with an unfathomable amount of size 00 clones traipsing aimlessly through the mall waving around daddy's credit card and drifting in and out of Bench/Hollister/A&F/Aerie/Le Chateau giggling and gossiping. 

Every store in this mall can be found in a more tolerable (outdoor) setting that doesn't set you back $20 in parking - H&M, Sephora, Banana Republic, MAC, etc. The worst part about this sterile, uninspired environment is those insipid, pushy salespeople that line the centre aisles of the mall shilling their horrible wares - you know the ones: the fake hairpieces, shitty/gypsy hair straighteners and flame-adorned clothing.

Reasons to go here (there are five): 
* Mrs. Field's soft pretzels (sadly, one of the only soft pretzels to be found in Toronto. At least they're good)
* Blue Marine & Co.: Soia & Kyo brand winter coats
* Carlton Cards: $0.25 helium balloons
* Jean Machine
* As a winter shortcut to walk between Dundas & Queen (it's always open to pedestrians)",2

The exterior of the restaurant is nice and there is ample parking... but unfortunately that is where my great experience ends.  Our waitress was ok.  It took her a while to come over to us, which was shocking because the place was a ghost town.  We sat for about 10 minutes waiting for someone to even acknowledge us after the hostess sat us.   There were a few wait staff walking around the place and we were promptly ignored by all of them.  there were people seated in our section and they were acknowledged, but not us?  Weird.  So lets get to the good.  I ordered a blueberry flapjack which was tasty and freshly prepared.  Unfortunately the corn beef hash that my fiance ordered for us to split came out on a cast iron skillet and it was COLD.  here is the deal:  either this was not freshly prepared or it was not heated to proper temperature before serving it to us.  we waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged and waited like 6 minutes for the food to come out.  It was shockingly fast actually.  But not in a good way.  We also asked for the biscuit on the side because my fiance cant have glutenous biscuits, but that was ignored as well.  I did not complain at the restaurant nor did we request to send it back to be heated because we all know what happens when you send food back.  They get one star for the facade and parking, and nothing else.  I am done with you Hash House for you are a has been...

25866,2,1551225600000,"My mother and I love Chinese, and more often than not we do take out. I'm sure we're not alone in usually choosing the restaurant in closest proximity to home. For us that means ordering from China One, probably the most prolific chain in the region, but rather pedestrian in the food quality (worthy of no more than 3-stars). The next closest to home is Grand China. We went there twice (the 1st and Last time -- no likey!!)

Chinese food can vary significantly from one restaurant to the next. Not only are there regional differences between Szechuan, Cantonese and Mandarin recipes, but in ""Americanizing"" the dishes, the styles differ from east coast to Midwest to west coast. Our preconceived tastes are Midwest centric, and that's hard to find in Vegas. Most restaurants here are either more authentic Chinese (in Chinatown) or west coast Americanized (the rest of the city/region)

Today, we ventured a few more miles out of the way to try Asian Wok. Whenever we try a new place we order big....testing the dishes we tend to like best in order to evaluate the quality. From appetizers to each entre', all were far better at Asian Wok compared to every other joint we've tried since moving here in 2012. 

Our order included Crab Rangoon, Potstickers, Happy Family, Chicken Fried Rice, Pork in Garlic Sauce, Chicken Egg Foo Young and Chicken w/ String Bean. My only complaint was that I felt the string beans were a bit over cooked. 

All in all,  we both decided this would be our restaurant of choice from here on in. By far, it's some of the best Chinese we've had here. We can't wait to try more items as we plan to explore more dishes in the future.",2

43836,1,1549584000000,"Portage Towers is not only the worst place I have ever lived; I wouldn't wish this place on my worst enemy. Let me just start with the day I was supposed to have my carpet cleaned. The carpet cleaning company comes in and starts doing their thing. I was at work at the time. My roommate goes to leave for work, runs back in because she forgot something and literally sees one of the carpet cleaners rummaging through clothes drawers in our bedroom and watched him pick up our underwear and bras (he couldn't see her at the time where she was standing). She was so horrified, she ran out. I rush home from work and we go down to tell the leasing office. At first, they acted like they were going to call his boss and get this taken care of. 3 or 4 days later, we haven't heard a thing from the leasing office. I go down there to see what's going on and they start telling us that they aren't going to do anything about it because, and yes this is a real quote from them, ""he probably has kids and a family and he's worked here for 2 years."" They also encouraged me multiple times not to get police involved. I couldn't even believe the words I was hearing. I couldn't get out of this place fast enough. I wanted to warn everyone in the building, but I didn't know where to begin. The building is HUGE. So, I'm now telling EVERYONE I know, and please pass this along. DO NOT LIVE AT PORTAGE TOWERS. They knowingly protected someone who went through mine and my roommate's underwear and bras, and he is still employed there. For the remainder of my stay there, because they refused to let me out of my lease (classy), I was forced to walk by this guy in the hallway, all the while knowing he had a key to my apartment. If you're still reading this, I can go on and on about all the bad things about living here. The management, maintenance is terrible, the facilities are never taken care of. I once had my dishwasher spewing water right onto the floor at midnight and they asked if I could wait to get it taken care of until morning. These are just a few of the small things they have done in comparison to me being completely violated in a place that was supposed to be my ""home.""",2

We tried the eggs benedict with sweet potato fries and the eggsmart poutine. Both were fine -- not the best, not the worst. No one ever came by to refill our coffees. It was very busy and like a lot of the other reviews note, they seem understaffed. The poor waitstaff seemed to be running around a lot.

They've got a vast selection of Japanese notebooks with great paper that are fountain pen friendly. It's fun to browse the big selection, but sometimes the staff can make you feel like they're following you-more worried that your going to steal something rather than trying to provide help. I've been served by the owner Russel who is very attentive and takes time to discuss the products, always a pleasant experience. However I've also been served by a woman who I believe is the manager-she is always very curt and seems to be trying to end the conversation as soon as possible rather than trying to see a sale through. I've even been served by other staff members who try to verify information with her and she shuts them down pretty fast. I would ultimately recommend stopping by only if you know exactly what product you want and ask for it right away, or go at slower times like evenings when you won't feel pressured. Still a great selection but not always worth the hassle to come in to the shop.",2

Only a handful of sushi rolls were fresh in that regard. The service was quick and very attentive to our tables as they cleaned up our dishes as we finished them.

Dessert was very common. They offered fried banana,  fried rice pudding and ice cream flavors of green tea, mango and red bean.

Seafood or Steak?  Every table I walked past had the signature chilled seafood tower (Lobstah, big honkin shrimp, crab legs, oysters)....it will not only impress, it tastes so fresh it's worth splurge for a special occasion.

Located in the Mandarin Oriental, this is a location i found on mobile yelp as I was visiting Las Vegas.  The Mandarin was a bit difficult to find, however, once you found it, it knocked my socks off.  But that is a different review.

The atmosphere was definitely not what i expected from an asian fusion restuarant.  It was very tastefully decorated (modern) but few oriental decorations.  calming low lights and candles and a great view of city center.

Our server, Kathleen, was wonderful.  Polite, attentive, SMILING.

The menu was very diverse from Japanese sushi to Indian curry and everything in between.  And a few favorites from the west.  Everything sounded so good and inviting but we had to choose what we wanted.

I ordered the specials of the day and they were a tomato tostada soup (what the hell is that i thought) and a vegetable curry dish with ricotta cheese.  Never had either but when in Rome . . .

the soup came in a big bowl with the hard goods inside.  Separately, Kathleen poured the soup portion on top of the substance.  The taste was incredible.  it was definitely a steak tostada in that bowl topped with the most scrumptious tomato bisque ever.

The curry came next and it was to die for.  I have never gotten full from eating vegetables, but this plate had me leaving 1/2 of it there.  It was so delicious and hearty but very filling.  the curry was spicy and the vegetables had an interesting blend of flavors - one of which i could have sworn is eucalyptus.  it came with a side of mango chutney and lentils for your desired (additional) flavoring.

We also ordered a mac and cheese - only this was smoked.  OMG.  smoked gouda in my M&C?  my new all time favorite.

They had me in intake within 48 hours of my initial call. 

I was not aware intake was just to ask and answer, as I was fully prepared to start fixing my life. Just an fyi, don't come expecting to lay it all out on the line during your first session. The female that processed my intake (requested a female) seemed really caring and communicative, so I requested to continue seeing her.

After about 7 months since my first visit, I can positively say that my time coming here has been worth it. The front desk staff is always bright and engaging on both my way in and my way out. The Therapist is compassionate, she listens, and she doesn't judge me on my poor decisions. What I like most is that she never tells me how I should feel or how I should have reacted.

30276,2,1550880000000,"This business is the closest nail salon near me and I decided to give it a try since the reviews looked great. Made an appointment thru this app, arrived on time and came originally for a gel Mani, pedi, and facial wax. I can tell you right now I only walked out with a Mani and pedi and left after that. So first thing I noticed, there is no nail color selection for people to look at before their service which is odd. She did give me a million swatches of color to choose from which was a little bulky. For my Mani, call me picky, but there was no towel under my hands while he was doing my nails which left me touching previous clients nail dust which was kinda gross.. While hes painting my nails he does this two nails at a time, which had me putting my hands under the blue light at least 20 times for the whole service. I wanted the holographic nail powder which ive seen on the other reviews here, at first he didnt know what I was talking about but then remembered and grabbed a dirty looking basket that had the nail powder in there. He then took a dirty sponge from the basket that was used for another persons nail which was very obvious, used it on mine, and then put it back. Once that was done, it was pedicure time. The manager it seemed was the one who did my pedicure and during the process kept getting up, with gloves and the utensils she was using on me in hand, to help out other employees and customers. There was no sorry when she returned, and this was frequent during my upgraded pedi. She didnt even know what color I wanted and grabbed a random yellow color from the cart she suggested was mine and I said I wanted black. I could very obviously tell also she was gossiping with the coworker next to her about either another coworker or customer with the whispered tone and looking over at the other people next to her. Also didnt even lay a finger on the massage chair buttons because the remote was filthy.. She also put the pedi stone she used on my feet and threw it into the tub of water my legs were still in and it kept bumping and scraping onto my leg. Why throw used trash into water I'm still using...? The world may never know. Lastly I paid for everything and paid $10 tip for my service which she then outloud announced it would be $5 tip per person I'm guessing so the guy who did my mani would hear? I'm not sure, but I won't be coming back. My holo is peeling off my nails after 4 days.",2

Their menu consists of many shareable plates and is good for a nice romantic dinner. We tried tagliolini, a seafood ceviche, scallops, beef tartare, and the bread plate. It was a perfect amount of food for two people. Food comes out slowly, but that's a positive thing if you consider the ""french style"" dining. 

The food was nice and well executed but nothing stood out. The tagliolini was drowning in butter and coupled with the butter soaked bread dish, was a little rich for me. I enjoyed the seafood ceviche but the bread that came with it did not work well and seemed to be just a filler. It also just didn't seem to be too fresh (the avocados were a bit off in it and had a strange taste), but I suppose this is Madison, so I can't set my expectations too high. I also enjoyed their take on beef tartare and that it was not a completely raw plate of beef. 

The scallops were enjoyable and probably my favorite dish there. Well done with good flavors. 

Overall, I enjoyed the ambience and location of the area. The food was well executed but nothing to write home about. Prices were reasonable, but with so many nice New American options in Madison, I might make a circuit and check those out before I come back.",2

ok, I've never discussed this one problem that I have 
which is called strippers 
I don't frequent strip clubs because I have a stripper problem 
I would say my Stripper issue is similiar to a gamblers issue in casino. No will power. I want them all, I put all my money down.

Strippers can have all my money. It's been this way forever. This is why I don't go to strip clubs often. 
I drain my bank account, even if it's the last $10 I have, to spend. I could be saving money for a heart operation and if you take me in a strip club, that's it. Over. 

Tonight We went to Skin Cabaret 
and I lost my mind, soul, and pennies 
I don't think my male counterpart could keep up with me in there 
The way they shake their asses ......

First of all I am a completely heterosexual, non bisexual, female
second of all , my attraction to strippers is similiar to the average dirty old man in America 
I like them blonde, skinny, small waists with huge fake tits 

for some reason we couldn't get the stripper I wanted to come over, she was fake blonde hair, fake big tits, fake face.
i asked for her twice and even our waitress asked her to come over, but she kept saying she was too busy with her friends and would come over later
 Sigh. Oh well  
so I got 4 lap dances from 4 other girls until I found ""the ONE"" 
this girl named Cameron 
she was sooo sexy 
 she exuded sensuality and sex from her pores, her eyes were the epitome of ""fuck me "" eyes 
her body was sooo sexy, small waist, nice ass, big huge fake tits, she had dark hair, she looked a lil middle eastern but she says she's Sicilian 
Me and my male friend both got TWO lap dances from her each
I said ""that's it, we don't even need to see anyone else after her, she is IT"" 
If I wasnt dragged out of there, I would still be getting lap dances from her right now

She almost made me a LESBO

My male lover told her she was turning his girlfriend bi, lol 
I recommend her to every guy and girl who visits arizona 
Cameron at Skin Caberet in Scottsdale 
lap dances are $10, but i usually gave $35 
hence why I shouldn't frequent strip clubs 
I give them what i think they should be making, which to me is usually double or triple what the going rate is 

I wont be going back, unless someone else sponsors me",2

I think that this restaurant is a good quiet place to have a business meeting or some type of casual gathering but definitely not somewhere to go if your primary interest is tasty food.

Take home message: I didn't go here for the food, and I wouldn't go back for it, but with limited time to eat and catch up with visiting friends staying in the hotel, this restaurant served its purpose.

One of my English father's favorite side dishes and they were usually cooked beyond recognition in our home. As part of my master plan to enjoy and appreciate all foods, especially those I've avoided since childhood, I've started ordering it every time I see it on the menu.  This has worked very well at the Farm Café in Portland, but not so much at Aureole in NYC. There they served it as a purée and boy that was some rough going. But Bobby Flay and his team managed to move me from toleration to adoration of this long avoided vegetable. Maybe it was the addition of toasted pecans and pomegranate seeds? 

Vegas is a weird mix of upscale and low rent, but this restaurant managed to walk the line as a casually nice place. Expensive, but not ridiculous in the context of the Vegas price scale, and I felt the food and service made it feel like money well spent. Aside from one flickering light above our table (that they were very apologetic about) our service was wonderfully attentive.

We started with cocktails and I enjoyed the house Mesa Margarita and Mr. K upgraded, per usual, to one of the higher end variations. Both were nice, especially when coupled with our Crispy Squid appetizer and the wonderful selections from the bread tray. Three diverse choices, but I especially enjoyed the walnut bread.

For our entrees, I chose the Grilled Mahi Mahi and Mr. K had the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. Mine was filled with subtle flavor and texture, but the pork had a nice kick. Enough that you probably want to think twice about ordering it if you like things mild. The sides are served family style and in addition to the brussel sprouts, the chili relleno was very good, but the mashed potatoes weren't memorable.

On a ""Diva"" level, Frank Marino certainly fits the bill. Each time he came out in between acts, he was wearing a different gown and he completely rocked them. He definitely knows how to run the show and keep things moving. I found a couple of his jokes to be a little crude, but overall he is very funny and entertaining.

As for the performances, most of them were brilliant impersonations. I thought the Mariah Carey was a little bland, but the Celine Dion, Liza Minelli, and Tina Turner were spot on (just to name a few that stood out in memory). The problem for me is that although they are all pretty good at what they do, it started to get a little tired about two-thirds of the way through.

The flour used on the wrapping/skin is not high quality flour since I am somewhat gluten sensitive and the food here triggered it.  Decor, just plain awful, not that Asians care much about decor, it's always about the food and maybe the service for promptness/friendliness/courtesy.  Conclusion, there is nothing awful here BUT just nothing w/ a ""WOW"" factor, you know what I mean.  In my opinion, the best Chinese/Dim Sum in Toronto was the year 2004, summer months, Golden Court in Markham.

The crispy chicken skin isn't just skin, they give you two full pieces of chicken and is served with mashed potatoes. The steak has a few small sides on the plate making it look more appetizing and colorful. I also recommend ordering a few sides to share with the table. 

Dessert was also really good. We had roasted banana smores and some kind of strawberry cake.

                         FIVE STAR FABULOUS.  
   Can't imagine finding any other better than theirs. 

We ordered two fried Lake Erie Perch dinners.  However, didn't come with the expected white rolls typically served by most spots.   Instead, generously-sized textured golden brown slices of bread with nice big pats of butter.   Took a bite.  Ohhh, my.  Reminded me of the wonderful Date Nut Bread from the closed (sigh) Hough's Bakery.  (Have tried to duplicate that tasty slightly sweet treat at least three times---without success.  Very good, but not close enough.)  Found the closest---maybe it's ""near equal""---with only the minimal of ingredient differences---here at Public House.  Yes!

Asked one of our two super-friendly servers what this amazing bread was, and if I could purchase a loaf.  IRISH SODA BREAD.  Smiling, she thanked me, but after a thoughtful moment she apologized and said she couldn't because they'll easily go through what they baked for that busy day---the Friday before St. Patrick's Day.  It WAS crowded with a line running along the front of the building.   Darn.  She bent down and whispered.  ""I'll give you another slice to take home.""   (Wrapped up neatly in aluminum foil, along with another big pat of butter, I thoroughly enjoyed it for breakfast the next day---but with controlled restraint.  I wanted to make it last.      

Fried Lake Erie Perch, Tartar Sauce, Coleslaw, and Fries, an easy 4 stars.  All fresh and in generous serving sizes---enough for 2 meals the next day.  We LOVE our perch dinners, and this was one of the VERY BEST of dozens over the years from several bars and restaurants.  Highly recommended.  Especially that tender, moist, yummy, one-slice-is-not-nearly-enough, baked in-house BREAD !

The Good News . . . Fried Perch dinners and Soda bread are served all year long
.                                    ---not just during Lent !
The Bad News . . . .  But ONLY on Fridays.

1) To their credit, the crabcakes in the combo platter were full of lump crabmeat, but mine was slightly cold in the center.  The garlic sauce was flavorful, but it was too salty and there was too much of it. 
2) The hush puppies were a bit dense and could have used butter for dipping.
3) The fries were a greasy mess - undercooked, mushy, and flavorless.
4) The corn was overcooked and covered with a salty sauce (maybe the same as the crabcake?).
5) Coleslaw was part of the combo, but they had none. We were not offered any substitutes or a reduction in price. Just ""no coleslaw for you.""

49631,1,1549497600000,"Restaurant review
This is hands down one of the best restaurants in Champaign. It is always super busy and you have to wait in line whether it is before they open or any time during the day. Part of the demand is the small restaurant space, but the food itself is top notch and likely the best BBQ restaurant in IL. I have been here twice and only tried the burnt end sandwich. It is always too busy for me to come for dinner especially if you have a kid due to the limited booth spaces. The burnt end sandwich is a culinary masterpiece due to the nice smokiness of the the beef along with the crunch of the cole slaw and the acidity/sweetness of the georgia peach bbq sauce. I like my bbq sauce with spices and on the sweet side. They have a large selection of bbq sauce which I have not even tried yet. You also get a side which for me is the double baked potato. This is simply cooked to perfection loaded with cheese not too salty or heavy. I always want to try something else for lunch, but just knowing the burnt ends are limited makes me order this off the menu! Easily a 5 star + restaurant down here in Champaign

Pros: flavorful bbq, great sauce selection, the dishes are well balance and have the right taste along with the perfect texture blend

Cons: you have to wait a long time if you come late, we were here 5 minutes early and the restaurant was immediately full after they opened the door and the line was forming around the corner

Hidden deals:

42974,2,1549065600000,"This local bakery has a lot to offer the lucky patrons in the area. There are several cases full of a wide range of pastries, shelves of bread loaves in the back and a list of cafe drink options to combine into a meal or the perfect snack. I randomly chose a cannoli, a Portuguese egg tart (not in the case but they had them in the back - so ask if you don't see them) and a Portuguese shrimp dumpling. The three treats came out to only $4.80!! They also have soup and sandwich options but I didn't get past the pastry case options to consider them. 

The cannoli was delicious, and my favorite of the three choices. The pastry was thick but crisp, which held up against the (almond?) paste filling and a thick drizzle of chocolate. The Portuguese egg tart came in second. The tart shell was super thin but leant a different texture to the generous amount of golden egg-custard filling. A slight caramel flavor in each bite was great. Last was the shrimp dumpling, well made and cheesy but I used it more as a palate cleanser from all the sugar I was consuming. Great old-school local bakery to grab a bite, spend a couple hours reading and maybe take a loaf of bread home afterwards.",2

You may think that you can only get wedding gowns that start at $5,000 here, but that's simply untrue.  You can get affordable dresses for under $1,000 here.  I purchased a lovely Nicole Miller gown for $630.  

Staff are very friendly and will let you try on your dress so you can see if it goes with any accessories you've bought.  You get the royal treatment here as you can help yourself to the treats they have for customers and when you've found ""the one"" you get a glass of bubbly and a little gift!

What I appreciated most about White is the dress fitting where the owner of White, Andrea Anastasiou, fashion stylist and editor is there with you ensuring you look your absolute best.

38313,2,1549756800000,"I enjoy contemporary art, but I think I chose the wrong time to visit this museum. It's pay what you can, which is great, but they are moving locations soon, and the art exhibits currently on display were disappointing to me. There was a fountain on display outside the building, which was interesting but I didn't realize it was one of the 3 pieces on display until I went in and saw just how small this place is. There was a video, a sailboat on it's side and a chalet. That was it. It was interesting to walk through the chalet and look into the boat and be able to touch the objects that were part of each display. The video seemed interesting but was approx 45 mins long and we didn't want to sit through it. All in all, it seemed like a waste of a trip.

I'm not sure if I'll visit the new location. I took me years to get to this one, only to be disappointed at how little it had on display. I've definitely been more moved and inspired by other collections of art. But I might be inclined to get the new location a chance in the hopes that I will enjoy a different collection more than I did this one.

I made a point to meet a friend there the other night, knowing that they would share my attraction to the bar's laid back atmosphere. I think I share the same sentiment as some of my fellow Yelpers do, that I want to keep this place from turning into something bad or worse, trendy. I compare it to finding a good hairstylist or a good tailor: after a long search and numerous disappointments, finding the right combination of good service and a relaxed atmosphere is hard to come by, especially for a bar.

We had the following dishes:
1) the benny - the sausage was surprisingly tastier than expected. It didn't taste fatty and wasn't too dry or oily. The hollandaise sauce was nice. You can substitute your side of potatoes for greens. 
2) banana bread french toast - definitely on the sweeter side. Comes with three slices of bread doused in a very sweet caramel sauce - not recommended unless you have a sweet tooth. 
3) scotch-ish eggs - two soft boiled eggs fried with panko served on a baguette. This is a very simple dish that comes with both greens and home fries. The eggs are unique but the panko comes off the egg easily once you cut into it. 

I was looking forward to trying the blueberry cheesecake waffles but looks like it's out of season. 

Lastly, we felt like we were being rushed out as soon as we finished our meal, but I guess you can't blame them since there was a pretty long line of people waiting.

Elvis (Darren Lee) opened the show.  He was REALLY good.  He has won an award as the best Elvis impersonator at the world Elvis convention or something like that.  Not sure why he opens the show, I guess they want to get you into the show right off the bat.

Next up I believe was Katie Dix as Carrie Underwood.  Not too bad, I'm not into that kind of music, but she also covered a couple Guns N Roses songs for those who don't like Carrie Underwood.  She used to be part of the Fantasy show at Luxor.

Johnny Potash was up next, fiddling his way through a tribute to Charlie Daniels.  He did a phenominal job.  I'm not into Charlie Daniels music at all, but I was in awe at this guy's skills.  Was definitely a highlight of the show.

Autumn Belanger's tribute to Lady Gaga was next.  Not really sure what I thought of it.  She pronounces Paparazzi weird.  

The final impersonator was Corey Melton as Michael Jackson.  He was good, not great.

There is a rug in the room, but I wish there were more soft surfaces to walk on after you've kicked off your shoes. The furniture is mostly new and retro. The bathroom hasn't been updated in close to 30 years. Overall, the new room looks better than it used to, and the way the furniture is arranged it makes the room feel bigger. If I had a preference, I'd take the upgrade to the Go room over the Fab, but I wouldn't turn down a Fab room.

The Flamingo seems to be catering to the 2 Broke Girls set - those who want to stay at Planet Hollywood who don't have the funds. Why else would two girls be walking into the hotel on a Friday night, one carrying a bottle of vodka and the other a curling iron. Travel light, ladies. The location remains prime and the prices are fairly reasonable. The food is mostly terrible and expensive. The pool is one of the best in Vegas.

Keep in mind that there's major construction going on both sides of the hotel. At one end, they're turning Bill's into an upscale boutique hotel. On the other, they're building Project Linq and refurbishing the common areas of the Quad (formerly Imperial Palace). That means you want a room in the middle of the property. You definitely don't want to be next to the Quad right now, as that construction site is jackhammering away 24/7. Ask where your room is before you take it, and check in as early as you can to avoid being stuck in a room across from a construction site.

I LOVE whenever we get unlimited side dishes & nothing else goes better with banchan than a hot stone pot soup. I will either get the soondubu or korean miso soup and homemade mandoo to top it off.

23222,1,1549411200000,"I just heard about this new addition to the area and made it in for a Friday night dinner.  While a bit tough to find from the Providence Road entrance, a subtle entry opens way to an impressively laid out restaurant.  The spacious bar and seating promotes a good atmosphere within the confines of the building but, untested is the elaborate outside bar setup which looks to be a must-go for warmer weather drinks.

The drinks were, simply, fantastic.  The food, however, was fantastically simple.  I'll lend some leniency given it's time on the scene, and give them credit for managing easy-to-miss operational issues like service quality and time.  As other reviews note, no freebees here, but the chips trio was great with very generously portioned guac/salsa/queso.  Calling it like it is, the food needs works.  The taste is short and I think the restaurant knows it as they appear to try to compensate with over serving taco-sauces (aioli, ranch-blah, etc.).  

Quite frankly, I'll be back b/c I loved the bar, loved the atmosphere and the food wasn't inedible, it just wasn't that good.  So I'll manage expectations accordingly.  I'm hoping that I can review the review upward in time to come.",3

We were there on a Monday night and the special was meatloaf. I'm not overly fond of meatloaf, and would usually not order it in a restaurant, but for whatever reason decided to go for it. I'm glad I did as it was amazing. 

I had a slice of carrot cake for desert that was also very good. All in all, it was a great meal with friends. It's worth mentioning again how friendly and helpful the staff was, which genuinely helps to make the Alexander Michael's experience. Al Mike's is what a neighborhood pub should be.",2

I have to admit that while the facility is new and clean and 100% better than their previous daycare there are several members of the staff that are not very pleasant and could use some training in customer service.  I know it is not a ""store"" but we as parents are paying for the service to have our children cared and I would expect that they would have better Customer Service towards us.   There have been 2 instances where I have overheard the Director making snarky comments about parents and a comment that everyone calling today has been rude and asking SO many questions.  Then I had a run in with the Assistant Director where I tried to bring something to her attention in regards to a comment my son had made 2 days in a row about what he was being told in his class and her response was I highly doubt that was said but I will look into it.   I really don't appreciate being made to feel like what my son said was not true or valued.  She never even asked my name or the name of my child to follow up...

The one thing I must say is that the teachers are good to great!!  They are active with the kids and spend as much time outdoors as they can when the weather is good.  They bring home art work almost weekly with the things they are learning.  Every day when I pick them up they tell me what they have done and learned.  It makes me feel good that they like where they are going!

I agree with some of the other reviews about the snacks.  Saltines and dry cereal do not constitute healthy snacks.  I have also started packing extra items in their lunch because by the time I pick my kids up at 6:15 pm they are STARVING and I cant get them home and feed them fast enough.

My only recommendations are to work on customer service with the staff, the Director and Assistant Director included!  And to implement some better snacks; Fresh Fruit, yogurt, or string cheese.  Just something more than dry cereal or crackers.",2

Also, if you go to their Web site, you can get 10% off your overall repair cost. http://www.ahsappliance.com/  

I've now met all three of their techs (Tom, Lee, and Tommy Jr) and have been impressed by the knowledge of all three. Also, I'm admittedly curious and usually hang out to watch them work. I've known many a repair guy who would be frustrated by this, but not AHS. These guys took time to explain what they were doing and to teach me how to avoid it in the future. 

Perhaps best of all, one of their techs told me what I needed to do, and then told me how easy it was and that I'd probably save a lot of money buying the part online and doing it myself -- now THAT is integrity, the kind of iIntegrity that is sadly missing from most of our society.

The races are perfect: 12 laps at ~6 min is about how long you want to be racing.  Much more and you probably won't want to do another heat, much less and you're barely comfortable on the track.  Our group did three heats, two time-trials and one position race.  Obviously the race was the best, but they used time trial data to get us in a good starting position.  And boy do they collect data, each race ended with a printout showing our lap-by-lap time and placement and overall rankings.  The scientists and engineers in the groups loved it!

I noticed other reviewers complained about price, rules and time spent waiting.  First off, $30 is not expensive for a race unless you want to make this a daily thing.  Throw in the free shuttle service and I really think it's a great deal.  Second, yeah, if you hit the barriers hard or spin out you will be tossed.  We had a couple guys ding a side and have to reverse out but it was no big deal and they stayed in; but some guy who went so hard he actually went under the wall ruined an entire race for people.  The karts aren't hard to control, so if you're doing that you shouldn't be on the course.  Finally, we didn't spend more than a one or two races waiting between our races and that was enough time to recover, rehash the race and compare data.

This is why I did not rate five stars. I suppose as an American, I have a particular taste for strong, full-bodied, dry reds. The Italian cab tasted like pinot noir and not particularly great pinot at that. 

I got the calamari and then the steak for dinner. The calamari was fried perfectly, the batter was crispy and the inside was soft. The shishito peppers and lemon created some depth without being overly strong. The steak was prepared perfectly as well, a true medium and the meat was marbled and delicious. The roasted garlic and Brussel sprouts were more like a garnish but added some flavor.

The place has an interesting atmosphere. The restaurant is like an upscale diner with a trendy bar area.

I was here with a group from a conference I was attending here. We had a 45 minute wait when we arrived at 8pm so we started at the bar. The bartender seemed a little put off when we asked to sample the craft beer options.For me the draft options were just ok. The Deschutes IPA was the best of the bunch and at least I've had it before so I knew what I was getting into.

When finally seated at our table, we ordered a few appetizers - the pretzels with provolone cheese, the shrimp, and the zucchini fritters. The shrimp was the best of the bunch with a spicy coating. The fritters were second best but the pretzels were a disappointment. They were like pretzel rolls and huge with no real flavor. Same with the cheese. Smaller bites may have made them more enjoyable.

For an entree, I ordered the sea bass which came with barley and arugula. The fish was good and I enjoyed the crispy edges but the barley was too salty portion size was quite tiny. 

The best thing about this place to me was our server who was great with explaining specials, her favorites, and refilling drinks. But when you hit a restaurant, you expect the food to stand out and it did not for me.

There was no wait which was nice. We arrived around 1130 on a Saturday. The waiter was really great. He took our drink orders and gave us just the right amount of time to look over the menus and decide. Both my girls opted for kids meals. One swirly twirly pasta with freckled fruit and white milk and the other Mac n cheese with oranges and chocolate milk. I have to comment (because I always try my kids food too) that I was impressed with the Mac n cheese. This was by no means your blue box special, but felt homemade and tasted great. My husband and I both opted for the Tavern Cowboy Ranch burgers, I got the small and he got the large. They were great. The only thing I wish was different was a little less lettuce, but I can change that in the future. I of course had to get the garlic fries (they are AMAZING). We did end up taking advantage of both the bottomless fries and the bottomless kids pasta. My oldest inhaled the swirly twirly pasta and wanted more. We even had the manager come around and ask how everything was, we told her great. The attention to detail that the server and manager paid was phenomenal and we will definitely be back. The last thing I have to mention is that the server offered if we wanted any of our drinks to go.

We asked the lady working which sandwich she would recommend and she number 1 and 4 is the best, but they are sold out of number 4...So number 1 it is LOL? 

She was premaking the numbers 1 so the sandwiches were instantly ready after that conversation. The sandwiches were still warm and smelled delicious. Both of them were $3 and they were massive. There was also a lot of filling in them. We got one spicy and the other without. I accident ate the spicy one and my mouth was burning. WOOO was it HOT.

1.5 stars. I usually round up but here I'm rounding down for the dishonesty of their check-in scam.

We were craving sushi around 1am and this was the only AYCE we saw that was open past 2am.

Service was friendly and not inattentive though that may have had to do with the fact that we were the only ones there at 1am (despite their supposedly closing at 3am).

Last call is posted in the window as 2:15 but when we sat down we were informed last call was at 1:45am. Did not contest the sign on the door. Maybe they changed their hours, but if that is the case then they needed to also change their signs.

The sushi rice was too sweet.

Fish across the board was not very fresh.

Uni was not great. The brighter the color, the better. Pale or brown uni has either a plasticky or seaweedy (and not in a good way) taste to it. These were pretty brown, but surprisingly not as awful as at JJANGA or Goyemon.

Oysters were far from the worst I'd ever had, but the freshness of a raw seafood item is still worryingly called into question when you feel the need to put lemon slices directly on it.

Snow crab was so cloyingly sweet it was sweeter than the shaved ice we had at Chada St on Tuesday. It did not taste like crab at all, real *or* fake.

We asked for no sauce on anything but they only remembered to not put sauce on our shrimp tempura roll, which had surprise ""krab"" (fake crab) in it.

Which brings me to the rolls. Rolls on the special, baked, and fried rolls lists (basically everything that was not on the traditional roll list) were not very varied. Almost everything had fake crab in it even if it was not a listed ingredient. Everything that didn't have krab had spicy tuna and everything that didn't have spicy tuna had krab.

We ended up only getting a couple rolls because after they couldn't get ""no sauce"""" right we were not confident they would be able to do ""no crab"" reliably and did not want to fill our stomachs with that sweet crud.

Disappointed that they had run out of tempura green tea ice cream. I wasn't sure how they could still have green tea ice cream and still have tempura and not have tempura green tea ice cream (I had horrific thoughts of soggy, pre-tempura'd ice cream dancing rudely in my head, but the DH informed me that they have to super-freeze a ball of ice cream in order to tempura it without it melting, and that this takes 2 hours or more, so apparently that's how).

Don't like the scam they're running for the check-in discount. Have encountered the whole ""write good review for a discount"" scam before, but never seen it attached to a check-in, or seen a place where they want the review up front. Makes no sense.",2

She was very patient, when we did order and I told her I wanted my dinner Native Lao hot she said that was very hot to which I said yes I know  she gave me a  smile then took my husband's order.
 
I ordered the Spring Rolls with Lao Sausage #3, they were good but I forgot to ask for fish sauce as I am not a fan of peanut sauce. The peanut sauce was more like peanut grit in flavored water.  The rolls were cut in half which allowed sharing this was nice but there was very little sausage and egg, an excessive amount of noodles and none of the other ingredients.  Entree was the House Special Moak (mok) Pa #29 asked for Native Lao (very spicy) it came Timid no heat at all this was a disappointment. Also it was very wet like it had been submerged in water as opposed to steamed as it should be.  The steamed veggies a combo of green beans, broccoli and carrots were crisp tender but bland,  not the veggies I though would be served at a Laotian place. My drink was Thai Tea which was very weak. Over all the meal had very little flavor, not something I would order again if we returned.  Definitely not worth the $15.99 for the entree.

Husband ordered Pork Eggroll #1 I only took a bite as there was only the 1 what stood out was a hint of Sesame Oil which made the flavor pop. He said it was better than any other eggroll he has had but could have had more pork in it.  Entree was Khua Phet Khee Noo with Beef #15 he ordered his Careful (a little spicy) his too came with no spice, however the basil in his dish did give it a nice flavor.  He enjoyed his dinner, but again not worth the $11.95.",2

The patio is fantastic with a wonderful view of the rivers, and you can watch the incline go up and down.  They had a decent selection of beer (although we were uncreative and went with Yuengling) that was nice and cold and reasonably priced given the location.  Our server was prompt and friendly.

My friend told me they had great burgers and I was like damn that place is open.  Than I figured I would give it a shot because I love a great burger and supporting local independent businesses.    

The cheeseburger was great.  It looked like the standard size is 1/3 lb.  It had a great char on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside.  I got the mixed basket of fries and onion rings which is enough for 2.  If you read some of my previous reviews you know I don't like to share fries so you know this was a big size of fries and onion rings.  Another great thing is that it was inexpensive $5 for the cheeseburger, $4 for the hamburger and $4 for the rings and fries.  

If you watch Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network they would refer to this place as a Dive and I think the people their would not mind.  The entrance was a metal door that didn't even have a door knob.  It was really dark on the inside and like most places in central Phoenix it was a small space.  It took about five minutes to get someone to notice us.  Once we got the attention of the waitress she was apologetic and seemed very nice.  The booths were really small and seemed to be made by someone who got a C in shop class.  The funny thing is about half way through our meal my girlfriend and I noticed that it was an about a 99% AARP crowd, even the employees.  I guess only the cool Gen X and Y know of the place.

Most everyone in this company makes themselves available for text or call at all times, Sundays, nights, etc. When the job started they walked us though exactly what was going to happen each day. Jose was amazing with the construction process and everything else! The workers came exactly when expected and were really quick and pretty clean about their work. Our travertine and pool resurfacing (pebble tech) look better than expected. At the end of everything they make sure everything is to our approval, and we understand all of the chemical workings of the pool. Shawn did an amazing job at that.

38450,2,1548979200000,"So much to do ...   This a mixed review of the place.


I will start with the fun factor :-).    This place offers many things to many different people.   
Downstairs - There is a a restaurant, bar, and bowling.    This reminds me of many of the bowling / clubs I have been to (Lucky Strikes, Tora (where there is bull riding), etc...).

Upstairs - There is more bowling, a bar where there is live music, a movie theater with an incredibly large screen.    Many things to do if you are in to it.

I went to see Uncle Kracker play.   They are still working out the kinks in my opinion.   Uncle Kracker played and half the tv's in the bar were still tuned to ESPN and Fox News.    They will quickly turned the tv's to the musician after a request was made.    

The fun factor rates high.    The drink prices are more than what you would expect.

Parking is terrible.   There are signs asking you not to park in the shopping center lot.   

Food
The food is not very good.    I have had their version of big bang shrimp (shrimp with a tempura batter, deep fried), seared ahi tuna, and nachos.    Shrimp and ahi tuna will only be ordered again after providing the wait staff special instructions (cook / sear).   The nachos are really bad.   Thin chips with movie quality cheese sauce (They are cheap).

I will go back if I am with a group for drinks (decent beer selection) and live music.   I will not dine there - they should remove the restaurant and put in another bar / feature live acoustic acts.

Summary:
Fun Events:  Good / Fun.   
Prices: Pre-made Long Islands were $9 per... pretty expensive   Beers run $5-7.
Food:  Bad.  Order at your own risk.
Service:  Good until they get busy.   The staff when I have been there have been overwhelmed or disorganized.
Parking:  Terrible

Overall - I give it a below fair rating hoping they will improve.",2

Otherwise, the staff has always been friendly to me and the course is beautiful. 
Went to practice putting for an hour or so and the gentleman at the bar gave me a free soda. Plus, who doesn't like complimentary cool wet towels at the end of a round?

Not sugar. Next, the music. We're talking full on norteñas and duranguense music. To clarify, I am of Latin origin, my family is from Mexico more specifically so I would know what that type of music is or even what is sounds like. And I was born here In Phoenix mind you. HOWEVER.. The other 50 people in the building probably don't share my same ethnic background much less know what is being said in these songs that are blasting and blaring! I would expect this from macayos but not Applebee's. Overall very unimpressed or even comfortable with the atmosphere. So the only thing that was ok was the food. Just ok though.

36788,3,1550275200000,"I was waiting for the moment Hank's was going to disappoint, after all its in any establishment's nature to have a bad day. But it never happened. Coming here 5 times - every steak was phenomenal, martinis were never anything less than tasty, the service was always impeccable, the live entertainment was consistently classy, and every experience was top notch. It should come as no surprise to anyone but it is without a doubt, Green Valley Ranch's best restaurant.

It started with their 5-7 happy hour. Sitting by the bar and enjoying the piano ballads / live jazz, while sipping away with colleagues / clients on some of their killer martinis. From the dry glass to the exotic flair, I have always enjoyed their lychee and koi martinis. Every sip was smooth and the potency of the after taste made for a great finish. As one goes further into Henderson, these places just don't seem to exist.

When it was evident the drinks would be taking a toll, it was on occasion, some complimentary bar food from the generous bartenders. If it wasn't drinks on the house, it was sides from the kitchen. A creamy and no frills mac and cheese, some cream spinach, an incredibly tasty lobster chowder, and a fresh, yet plump variety of shrimp with some cocktail sauce. After too many chowders / bisques, along with some of the best crab cakes in Sin City, did I finally decide to shoot for what they're known for best: Steak.

I started small with a petite filet mignon, which for $40 was a bit more paltry than I had hoped. But any meat with the words ""petite"" or ""small cut"" is going to be a pricier, albeit unsatisfying portion for any serious carnivore. Instead of focusing on its size, I switched it to its taste, which was nothing less than foodgasmic. Charred bits, smooth textures, and juicy meat at its finest. I eventually moved onto to the full sized 9oz filet($46) and the prime rib New York ($45), both of which had me going gaga for more.

Then there's the grand daddy. It's name is the Tomahawk Ribeye ($95) and while its a portion for two, I think I can gladly take it on by myself. It reminds me of something Tarzan or Fred Flintstone would eat - a hilarious hunk of meat on a bone, with a smell that ignites hunger for even the most casual meat eater. Paired with a gorgonzola crust ($8) and seared foie gras ($19) to add to the meal and sides of creamed spinach and potatoes, and its both a vegans worst nightmare and a glutton's finest moment.

I had the crispy basil chicken (level 3 hot) and Jon had the shrimp stirfry (level 1 hot).

37946,1,1550448000000,"This is a place that is hard to rate. A four star review seems high for what this place is, but a three star seems too low. But I am giving it 4 based on ridiculously cheap prices and tasty food quality and the rest is just ancillary.

Taco Tuesday and Wing Wednesday bring me back to this little dive over and over. This isn't your typical Taco Tuesday in Cleveland, where you only can choose from a few tacos. There are probably 15-20 choices that sometimes rotate, sometimes repeat. Last night I had the Ancho Chicken, Chipotle Pulled Pork, and Chicken Paprikash tacos. I'm usually squeamish about ordering meats and such in divey places but the flavors and quality seem pretty high. Lettuce, tomato, and cheese top all tacos, you choose your meat fillings (a few veggie choices, too), hard or soft shell, and sour cream and/or salsa. Beers are German and I usually split a giant stein with a friend, but last night I opted for a normal size beer. So, three tasty tacos and beer = $7. Seriously. $7. Wing Wednesday is a similiar set up with several wing choices, both dry and wet style. I love the wings but I haven't been going as often since wings make my clothes shrink.  

Ambiance and service? Well, remember you are eating good food on the cheap. Corners have to be cut somewhere. This is a super old historical bar that could be quaint, but sadly, is pretty rough around the edges. It did appear that they recently painted and repaired some ceiling damage. But the tables are old school cheap bar tables and it's very, very dark inside. And service varies from average to slow. Best bets are to sit right at the bar for quicker attention. It gets packed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and I don't think the kitchen can quite handle the volume efficiently during peak hours, but that's ok. Remember... $7 for really flavorful tacos and a quality German beer. Just know going in that this isn't fast food. And if you chose not to go? That's ok. More room for me at the bar to enjoy my uber cheap and suprisingly tasty tacos.",2

it's a hole in the wall for sure - so for that alone I would warn away from here if you're trying to be impressed by ambience or decor. U will not, repeat, not - find it here. 

All that being said the food is quite simply delicious. I'd say it's surpassed Hamdi's for sure. 

I love their free starter soup, so we can't help but going for second or thirds. We got grilled goat and beef ribs with spaghetti and rice as our sides. And the portions are healthy (should be for $14 a pop for each respective meal). They threw it all on a massive ""to share"" plate which we didn't mind because, hey, ""when in Rome..."".

The rice was amazing, wow. Goat was so tasty I had to fight my kids for meat, but it was a really nice spice. The ribs were succulent and not served up as a rack but cut individually with bbq sauce. YUMM! the spaghetti was, meh. Just boiled and some
Ragu tasting sauce. I would have given this place a 5 star (decorum aside) if they were remotely creative with their side spaghetti - but I guess it's something they have to work on?

The service is typical of the ""order at the front"" establishments - but the man was sweet and generous with allowing us to gauge our faces with soup. They also don't have place menus - or a proper order board just pics and prices on the wall, so don't hesitate to ask questions and get an idea of the meals! 

Happy eating!",2

I finally had a chance to visit this space last night to see the comedy troupe ""Bully Mammoth"", we found parking fine (while seeing a lot of ladies with wigs walking around) and it was a pretty easy building to find since it is a big warehouse structure. I was surprised to find the inside was a little cramped(since the outside looked so spacious?). The hallway/entrance where the ticket sales were located was cramped and cash only (understandably) led into a long and not very wide seating area. There were couches up against the walls, the seating was only about 6 seats wide and there was a raised area in back to see the show better. We luckily attained front row seats of the slightly raised smaller stage, which had an all curtained background.

It was a great show (even though I got deer hide fur in my eye just when a hilarious skit came on, trapped in between laughing too hard to take the offending hair out of my eye causing me to cry as well-one hazard of sitting up close!), but it got pretty hot in there and with the actors under the hot lights sweating with all the body heat. 

When the show was over, there was a mad rush to the bathroom (only one, I found more toilet paper but not more paper towels, but fairly clean) and it was located in a room that had assorted furniture, futuristic paintings and an organ. (?).

I walk into Boarders, the signs in the store say 70-90% off everything, I was promised 90% off everything!  Boy oh howdy, people who follow my Xanga Web Vlog know how furious I was to figure out that Boarders gave me the good'ole ""rope-a-dope"".

Loses 1 Star

I checked out their book selection, pretty decent considering that everything was about 80% off on average and I was kind of surprised that everything wasn't sold out.

Then, I saw a very beautiful oriental woman just walking around, looking at random books and my first thought was, ""bink"".  My second thought was, ""Hey I'll talk to her"".

Then I pondered on whether or not I should spend time and effort on going after her, after about 2 minutes I figured, ""sure"".  Little did I know while I was pondering, she vanished.

Loses 1 Star.

Well eff that noise, I grabbed a few books that looked decent and worked my wait up to the cashier.  She was in her 60's or something, and since I was in a cheery mood I decided to bust out the small talk.

Joey: Howdy!
Cashier: ...
Joey: Oh boy gettin some cheap books today, good stuff right?
Cashier: ...
Joey: ...
Cashier: $15.31 is your total.
*I pay with debit card*
*Cashier hands it back, doesn't say anything*
Joey: Well you have a good weekend *takes one step away*
*Cashier says nothing*
Joey: *turns back and finger guns her way* LIKEWISE! :D

Loses 1 star and a potential friend that never warmed up to me.

I hope a dog humps her leg for 12 minutes then bites her pinky toe. 

So yeah, shitty borders, It would be 1 star but everything was dirt cheap.",2
20741,3,1550275200000,"For a Japanese restaurant I was surprised to find all kinds of Asian food on the menu, including Korean bibimbap styled hot stone bowl and some Chinese flavored dish. Since it's a Japanese restaurant I tried to stick to the Japanese dishes like the chirashi, chef's combination sushi, soft shell crab roll and Hamachi kama. The fish was pretty fresh but the fish in my chirashi was cut into various random shapes which makes me feel like they are using scrap fish. 

Service was great and they were speedy with our order since we were time crunched to go to a show.

However the flavor and the expectations of a Japanese restaurant weren't met for me. I really wish they would stick to their own cuisine.",2

I had my first shoe shine with them and it was such a fun old-timey experience. 

Make sure you wear them when they're being done- more authentic experience plus it's easier for them to do a better job.

46408,3,1550620800000,"Ok. This time, I went around 3:30PM, which is probably the least busy hour. 
It was. Apparently the waiters we encountered before were only there if it's busy. 
Imagine that. 

Anyways, the service was greatly improved obviously, since there were only 3 parties including us at the restaurant. Neat! 
The lady (I'm assuming she's one of the owners) even asked what sort of Korean show I wanted to watch :P 

So.. why still 3 stars? This time, I'm just being very critical of the food. 
Last time, the AWESOME food made up for the sub-par service. This time, the service made up for the sub-par food. 
I guess I was expecting a lot given my past experience.. 

We ordered  steamed dumplings, Jjamppong, which is a spicy seafood noodle soup dish, and tang-soo-yook (sweet and sour pork). 

First off, the dumplings were probably some of the best I've had. They make it fresh, all hand made and lucky for us, they actually made them that day. It was just awesome. Everything a dumpling should be :) 

For the jjamppong, I was quite disappointed to see how not spicy it was. It had a LOT of seafood in it which was really nice, but the broth was really missing in its spiciness. Where was the kick I experienced with the ddeokbokki? The noodles could be more chewy, as they seemed a bit too soft to be used for that particular dish. Perhaps I can ask them to make it spicier? But seriously, I'm not that good at eating spicy things yet I could not feel anything spicy-wise at all. :/ Bummer-. 

On to the sweet and sour pork. Well...this... I mean.. The dish looked really good. It had all the elements of a good sweet and sour pork (a bit on the Korean-Chinese food style).. But the pork smelled. Quite a bit. The pieces of meat was quite big and it could have been awesome aside from the smell. I'm not that sensitive to meat smells so if it was to a degree that I could smell it, I'm really not sure how other more sensitive people might have felt eating that dish. 
The tempura coating became soggy within a few minutes, which you really don't expect on a sweet and sour dish. It should have stayed crunchy for at least the length of the time we were dining, which was around 30 minutes or so. 
Major turn off there too. The sweet and sour sauce itself was way way too sweet, so at the end, it was a hunk of smelly pork covered in soggy tempura coating in a sickeningly sweet sauce. 
Seriously, will probably not order again. :/

So... All in all, I'll definitely return to Miega for the dumplings, ddeokbokki and pa-jun. I did make it my goal to at least try most of their dishes, so we'll see how that goes. 

I do wish some of the dishes cost a bit less..but... well, I guess Korean restaurants are on the scarce side.. 

Miega, we shall see you again soon.!",2
40087,3,1549584000000,"Good and fast service. They're really efficient here, but still not trying to hurry you out the door. Everyone is really informative and they even offer to adjust your drink if you have issues with it.

I ordered the Hokkaido milk tea with sea salt cream and boba. I got it 50% sweetness since I read another Yelp review that said the drink is like 1000 calories and I got scared. I'm also not a fan of super sweet drinks. They told me that the sea salt cream is supposed to make it less sweet as well, but it still ended up being too sweet for me. I'll go 25% next time and recommend anyone that's not too huge a fan of sweetness to do the same.

Their boba is sooooooooooo soft, probably one of the best textures and consistencies I've ever had. But some people may actually like it chewier. If you let the boba sit for a bit before drinking, it'll harden a bit.

This place is definitely comparable to the better ones in the 626 (San Gabriel Valley near LA, land of the bobaz), so it's nice to know that this is always an option when I go to Vegas!",2

We had a good assortment of some traditional dim sum dishes (dumplings, pork buns, etc) and everything was hot and tasty, and many (like the pork and chive dumplings) were much bigger than we were expecting. Because you had to order off a menu rather than pick from carts, this resulted in us over ordering. The only real drawback is they didn't have some stuff, like Chinese broccoli, roast duck, noodles, etc. on the dim sum menu, so we had to order full (and huge) entrees of those. Oddly, the entrees didn't automatically come with rice. Despite those drawbacks, all of the food we got was delish!",2

41493,3,1549152000000,"Nothing here actually WOW'd me.
Nothing I ate really made me think 'I HAVE to have this again'.

This was like eating in a library. Everyone was quite, they/we were afraid to talk because it was so pretentious. The classical music featured such hits as: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wod-MudLNPA&feature=related
Listen to this song and you can imagine the setting. 
I was seated on a purple velvet couch with pillows. After fidgeting with the pillows to prop myself up right at the table, well I noticed a foot stool, ""odd for such a fancy place"" I thought, but I had walked quite a way in 4 inch heels, so I used it.  I later found out this apparently is for you purse. (awkward)

First of all, the waiters seemed to hang on your every word, which was annoying. If I want to talk to my date, well i don't need anyone chiming in. I asked my date 'what do you think this means'? Referring to something on the menu, out of no where pops a waiter who answered just as he is about to answer. That's what i mean. The whole meal we had to whisper, we finally started texting each other. That's pretty bad.

If I smiled the head waiter would come over and ask if I needed something. I would say 'no I'm fine'. Pretty soon I just kept smiling to drive him crazy, it worked. He kept stopping at every pass. He probably now thinks I had the hots for him.

QUICK TIP: For those of you too embarrassed to ask: If you see a menu item that says (supp $40) after it, that means on top of the menu price they add $40 dollars to it for whatever reason, like the truffle cheese souffle. They said it was because of the amount and price of truffles used. The lamb, well I guess it was a baby lamb fed gold flakes and the milk of the gods .

Anyway on to the food: 
The amuse bouche (aka ""gift from the chef"") was a tin on a plaque. It looked like a tin of caviar, but it had something creamy under it. It was interesting. I ate it to be polite, but it was nothing special. In fact it was rather flavorless and the texture was off putting. It looked pretty.

Everything was plated beautifully.
The crab salad was my favorite menu item and my second course. It was excellent and almost too pretty too eat. The flavors and texture combined were amazing.

My dates cheese souffle was too rich for me. The date ate it and was ""not impressed"".  The expensive truffles really did not seem to add anything to the dish other than a presentation factor.

The main course I picked was lobster. It was beautiful, but a little tough. I expected it to melt like butter in my mouth. It didn't, in fact it was hard to cut. The flavor was ok, nothing special.

I tried my dates lamb, it was very good, it tasted like any other lamb I have had at a restaurant, which made me wonder again why the upgrade in cost.

The best part about the meal to me, was the bread cart. OH My God! It was pure heaven! They really need to open up a bakery for these clouds from heaven. They had the flakiest, butteriest, most flavorful, wonderful assortment of goodies, well i almost filled up on bread. 

You can have as many ""cart items"" from any cart, as your heart desires, don't be afraid to say ""one of everything"" when a cart comes strolling by. After 2 trips of the cart i pretty much did. There was garlic rosemary twists, brioche, cheese breads, croissants, crostini, baguettes, almost every type of bread imaginable and the absolute BEST!

The $20 martini or specialty drinks were delicious, worth $20 a pop? Not really. I did not taste or feel any alcohol. I think we should have gone for a nice bottle of wine.

Our actual desserts that came with the menu, they were odd. A strange menagerie of ingredients that I still am not sure if they went together well. I did not finish mine.

The dessert cart was pretty, none of the candies/treats were anything special. Coffee and water are extra$.

After the meal here ( $680 for 2), I wondered if rich people eat like this all the time, and if so, well I am glad I am not that rich or stuffy. I am, however, a food connoisseur. Someone who has always dreamed of eating at a 3 Michelin star rated restaurant, someone who would really appreciate the whole experience. I was somewhat disappointed, but I was truly happy for the experience.

Note: I talk about price a lot, but in actuality, $$ is no object for me. So it is more FYI for middle income, average diners visiting for special occasions.",2
39487,1,1550016000000,This sandwich shop is legit. I ordered the Cain and it did not disappoint.

43402,2,1549756800000,"So a friend dragged me here to see the Tempe Sound exhibit that shows guitars that various hometown heroes and favorite sons in the Tempe local music scene played. Featured are artists like Hans Olson, Walt Richardson, Gin Blossoms, The Refreshments, etc. There's even a life size evil-looking mannequin of a St. Madness member that I saw a number of rugrats run up to and then run screaming away from. LOL. There was also a synthetic drum set up so you can put on headphones and pound away to your heart's content - which was probably the most popular part of the exhibit with the kids. Afterwards I took a quick look at the regular exhibits. There are a few interactive things you can do on a computer like take a photo of yourself and turn it into a mosaic made from photos of all the folks that did the same thing before you. There's also a virtual ""Greetings From Tempe"" postcard you can make with your photo and send it to yourself by email. Also going on at the same time was a lego exhibition by Cactus Brick featuring a giant train set, giant castle, and pretty much every space vehicle in the Star Wars series. Right at the entrance there's all sorts of stuff for sale mostly related to either Tempe or the museum exhibits. That day we went there was also a concert event called LOUD IV - featuring the Salt River Brass Quartet, The Stu Siefer Combo, and Bad Cactus Brass Band. There were also a few food trucks: Bang Bang Dumplings, Sweet Magnolias Smokehouse BBQ and Paletas Betty. Didn't try the other trucks but I just HAD to have a Strawberry Cream paleta. Salt River Brass Quartet played first and played a wide range of material - jazz, classical and even pop pieces like their rendition of Pharrell Williams' ""Happy"" as well as Muse's ""Supermassive Black Hole."" Stu Siefer's Combo played more straight ahead traditional jazz standards. We didn't stay past that but a good time was had by all. I'll definitely come back for another event like this. Plenty of parking and it's free. Even though it usually closes at 5pm the museum building stayed open longer for the event.",2

The lunchtime special was tempting (3-course meal for $10), but so was the rest of the menu, and so I ordered from that. I mentioned to the waiter that this was my first visit, and to welcome me he offered me my choice of their 4 spreads, on the house. It was hard to choose, but I selected the melitzanosalata with carrot and celery sticks. He brought a generous portion, and I found the balance of roasted eggplant, walnuts, red onion, and mint very refreshing. I had to make myself leave room for my entree, the Ilios Platter with chicken souvlaki. Glad I did, because it came with 2 generous skewers of well-trimmed, marinated grilled chicken, accompanied by a salad of cucumber, tomato, feta, red onion, and olives in a tasty vinaigrette. There also was a mound of sautéed slices of new potatoes, drizzled with olive oil and herbs, and a large dollop of real tzatziki sauce (no sour cream in sight). Rounding it out was a dish of hot, fresh pita bread. I came hungry (no breakfast), but I still couldn't eat it all. Add to this the great decor and an attentive and personable staff, and I couldn't ask for  better, but I did get more. I ordered a dessert to-go. Much later - in place of supper - I dug into that. It was a scrumptious combination of angel food cake with a fluffy filling, toasted coconut, and passion fruit sorbet. Am I gushing?  Yeah, but it was that good.",2
34757,1,1549065600000,"This review is for the slot machines, theater, bowling alley, and some of the food establishments.

I stayed next door at the Grandview, which made walking over to South Point incredibly convenient. If you're not a fan of crowds, you can get most of the activities that you would on the strip, but in a quieter area. We frequently came here for food options when we didn't feel like driving. The food wasn't particularly amazing though.

The theater was awesome. On Tuesdays, movies are only $5 a ticket! For less than $20, my husband and I saw a movie and had gelato and popcorn. The bowling alley is equally impressive. Games are only $3.50 each, which isn't a bad deal. If you're there after midnight, games are only $1! There is an arcade inside the bowling alley, which was entertaining for adults as well as kids.

I think this place is pretty family friendly if you're traveling with kids on vacation. You can have fun ammenities in one spot, but don't have to drag your kids through some of the vices of the strip. If you want to be in the middle of all the activity, then you probably won't want to go here.",2

The green salsa was our favorite and will be a new craving for me. They offered us their ""hot habanero salsa"" in addition but we thought that is was the mildest of the three. Delicious, but mild. Maybe they're still working out the recipe. 

We started with the ceviche appetizer! Very fresh and had a perfect dice to the ingredients to pair with their chips. We did add a little lime juice to it to up the tartness.

Hubby got the Carne Asada tacos and loved the fresh tortillas. He got roasted veg on the side and said they were slightly too crispy/fresh still and he would have preferred a little more ""roast"" to them but he ate them all anyway. 

I had the Al Paster enchiladas with the Salsa Verde sauce and boy were those good. Lots of flavor in the sauces and I was swiping my rice and everything through my plate to get every drop.

Nope. Just a few days later he notices it's not fixed. Takes it back in and they say ""oh you need new brake pads and rotors"" SERIOUSLY?!? $391 is what they quoted him today.

started the table with the chilled seafood platter for 24.95  comes with 4 dungeness crab legs, 4 oysters, 4 clams and 8 shrimps.  and i think this one of the best deals in vegas for a shellfish platter.
entrees were grilled shrimp and scallop skewars, kids burger and a combo fried platter.   the fried platter was not to good,  over breaded and gummy shrimp and scallops, and 1 little peice of cod/haddock

First, the ambience is really nice. The bar wasn't too busy, so we sat down and was greeted by the bartender named Chris. We aren't hardcore drinkers, so he recommended us some drinks! I got the piña colda and it was so delicious and refreshing! We stayed at the bar for a few hours hanging out and getting lost in the amazing atmosphere! Chris was incredibly sweet and talked to us and gave us recommendations on what's good on the menu. We ordered the creme brule, which I am usually not a fan of to begin with.

Prices here are about run of the mill for Middle Eastern food.  If you want a chicken/beef/lamb shwarma with rice or the wrap version, they have this as many similar restaurants do.  The rice was on point that my husband got, as was his chicken.  I got the shwarma wrap and it wasn't what I was used to, so I felt like it was a wasted yummy meal.  The french fries were also cold, not crispy at all and soggy.

A plus is location, this place is close to the now booming University area and it's right off 29.  You may miss it, but it's in walking distance to one of the new light rail spots.  I'll give it a 3 because I felt it was eeeeeeeh.",1

I was STARVING when we entered the small resturant in a strip mall in Tempe. We immediatly ordered some tea and the Chicken Satee. I had the lemongrass tea, which was AMAZING btw... and my friend ordered the Thai (chai) tea and didn't care for it. I thought it kinda sucked that they didn't have free refils, but I guess that's a smart move considering the fact that they serve crazy spicy food! and can ... make more money! :P

Looking over the menus, I loved how you can choose your dish and then choose which type of protien for it to be cooked with, you can choose chicken, pork, beef, seafood or tofu. My We placed our order and had a good time. We waited quite a while... a little too long, considering the place was half-full. 

Finally our food came and it was quite the event. My friend ordered the sizzling beef and it came out still sizzling on a hot iron plate, think Thai Fajitas. They were good but after a while my friend couldn't finish it because it was so sweet! I had a bite and I thought it was good, but I could tell it was a little on the sweet side. My dish wasn't as extravegent, but still good! I had the spicy noodles with Chicken. It was crazy yummy! Nice and spicy, i felt the burn occasionally in the back of my nose... amazing. 

We ordered dessert from the not as gracious waitress, but I guess it's okay... she wasn't rude... just not very happy to be there. The dessert was good. I had the warm purple sticky rice with coconut ice cream topped with chopped peanuts and my friend had the fried bananas with coconut ice cream that was also topped with chopped peanuts. I loved mine, it was this perfect combination of warm and cold and sweet and creamy with a lil zing of salt from the peanuts which completely changed the profile of the ice cream. I was in heaven! :D my friend's dessert was also great. The fresh bananas were wrapped in what I think if rice paper and deep fried to a nice crispyness, it was sweet but not too sweet. a great ending to the meal.

To my yelpers - I say go. have fun and order dessert but please don't expect stellar service. I'll definatly be back for sure - with another thai cuisine lover in tow. :) Any takers?",2
41306,3,1550707200000,"Pho King Phonomenal is a bit of an exageration. But it is good. Well, more of a mixed bag. Its time for a round of good news bad news.

The good news, I was greeted warmly and promtly when I walked through the door. The lady running the front could tell I was a newby and offered me a sample of the pho broth. The bad news, she was not able to answer the question I had about the broth having anise or licorice in it. I don't think it does but to be safe, I went with the ramen instead of pho.

The good news, they have great ginger lemonade here. The bad news, it costs $3.95. More good news, I got a few refills at no cost and even took it with me.

Good news, portions are large here. You pay a bit but you get a lot. I was surprised at how large the bowl of ramen was. The bad news, it wasn't my favorite ramen. The broth was OK but needed a little help. More good news, they give you sriracha, hoisin, sambal and pickled peppers to spice things up. I used some of the peppers and hoisin. 

Good news, the beef in my ramen was plentiful and tender. The bad news, there were a couple of pieces that were too fatty for my liking. I pulled off what I could. And the meat was cut thick. I prefer the beef in my ramen to be thin sliced.

The good news, there was a lot of noodles (which I've been craving despite the summer heat) and fresh MUSHROOMS (which if you know me you know I love). The bad news, there wasn't much more than this in the soup.

The good news, service is great here. The staff know their regulars to the point they ask about events in private life. This kind of neighborhood business shows its true colors in the way it treats its customers. The bad news, some of the stellar customer I recieved was due to errors being made. First, the beef in my ramen was cooked in the wrong broth so they had to re-make it. That took a few minutes but they kept me in the loop. There was another customer in there who was seeking a refund for an error she received and they accidentally refunded my card so they had to re-run my card. The silver lining here, for the inconvenience, I was brought a bowl of ice cream on the house. Their corn cheddar ice cream was recommended to me. It did not disappoint. Sweet and corny with a hint of cheese. I would like to taste a pinch of salt in there for balance but it is otherwise solid.

Some of the issues seemed to stem from the fact that the owner had gone home sick today. The staff working were trying their best but struggling in certain aspects. Like running a ship without a captain. They'll pull through with a little focus.

If I come back again in the future I want to try the Drunk AF Noodles. And I would not be opposed to trying the Big Wang sandwich. The menu isn't huge but there are a few interesting options left for me.",3

First time I went, I just wanted to get antibiotics for an infected tooth.already in excruciating pain, they decided to take it upon themselves without asking me, to do this torturous evaluation of my whole mouth to check my bone density by sticking needles under my gums over and under every tooth. I'm already in pain from my infection and just wanted to get out of there to get my antibiotics. It turned into an hour and a  half ordeal. I left with my infection pulsating more, gums sore and bleeding everywhere, which caused me to get  canker sores in a bout 2 places because of all the needle damage. Then, stupid me, yesterday I went  back to get a root canal. I was desperate.  They gave me this whole shpeel about how they ""Don't mess around with pain, and not to worry cuz they will totally numb me so I wont feel a thing."" It was the worst root canal experience of my life!!! My infection had come back, which wasn't their fault, and  because of that, the Novocaine didn't work, and I had to have about 3 time more injections to stop the pain. These people knew I had a possibility of infection, and didnt warn me that the Novocaine might not be as effective and it would be a lot more painful. They decided to tell me after they started the procedure once I was almost in tears telling them that the Novocaine wasn't working.  That wasn't  the worst part.  I was sitting there for about 3 hours, and once I get home, my tooth already starts throbbing even though my whole face is still completely numb. By the time it wore off, like 7 hours later, I realize the temporary crown is HUGE, and EXTREMELY ROUGH!! My tongue was completely raw already (and I am just expecting more canker sores from that), but I had to file the tooth down myself with a 3 way nail buffer just to get it smooth enough so it wouldn't serrate my tongue any further. I've  never had a worse job done and been in such extreme pain. I went to mexico years ago to get a root canal AND a bridge, and It was 100 times better of an experience than what I went through yesterday.

No, I wasn't looking for a restaurant! Believe it or not, I trust CLE yelpers to point me in the best direction, not just for a night out! (Gasp!)

Moving on--sans 'tude. 

This was quite possibly the best eye doctor experience I've had in my entire life. Seriously. Perhaps it's due to the fact that I was just going to Eye Masters before... These folks, especially Dr. Abram, really care about their patients and they take the time to show it. 

I'm not the easiest person to deal with in any medical situation, but both the nurse and the doc spent a lot of time answering my questions, concerns...anything and everything. I got advice, clarity and my Rx fixed! Turns out my prescription was too strong for me! Who knew? And even with all this personal attention I was given, the staff here all stayed on schedule, helping folks quickly and timely. Genius!

Next I moved on to test out some lenses and measure the shape of my eye to ensure the perfect fit. I've never been through such a thorough eye exam before. I'm going to say it again: These folks take the time to do things right. I'm going back in a week to make sure my test contacts still feel nice. I mean, holy customer service.

36809,1,1550966400000,"From the moment we reviewed the menu, we *knew* we were in for a rough evening.   Starting with appetizers, seriously, how can you decide between deep fried deviled eggs, mac and cheese with crispy pancetta, or a grilled cheese pancetta sandwich served on an asiago cheese rolled and roasted red pepper tomato soup?  The answer is: we couldn't and we had to order all three (which, by the way, is tooooooooo much food).

My husband raved over the tender short ribs, served over creamy mashed potatoes, sautéed veggies, red wine reduction!   And, once again, we all had a hard time deciding over the sides and finally settled on ordering one of each:   bacon cheddar biscuits, candied jalapeño orange butter, the wood oven roasted beckett's bacon biscuit stuffing, and the spinach spaetzle, bread crumbs, pancetta (for which I would totally order a full meal of , but that's just me, as my husband and son where not quite as enamored with it).

Dessert, caused us much consternation and we were much more reserved...probably because we were such gluttons from the start.   May I say that if you are a bacon fan, YOU MUST ORDER the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores, caramel,housemade marshmallow, whipped peanut butter,
graham cracker.  Yes, literally it was two huge, thick strips of bacon dipped in dark chocolate - with a side of smores.  Personally, I just at the bacon and let my son eat the smores.    My hubby ordered the chicory coffee crème brûlée - which he enjoyed.

It's a nice restaurant at the ground floor of the Aura building. The service was good at lunch.

Tried the stuffed meatball. It was pretty good! Well seasoned and juicy. The basil on top added a nice fragrance. Accidentally ordered the app instead of the entree. 

Also tried the apple ravioli. It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It just didnt work for me. For me I would prefer a buttery crispy type of crust but it was quite sweet instead. The caramel sauce was good but I think it would have gone better with a buttery crispy pastry.

Les prix sont très abordables pour la grosseur des assiettes. Pour environ 12-13$ (en dollar US), vous avez une énorme assiette avec des frittes qui sont probablement préparé dans du saindoux et de l'huile la plus grasse possible. Le service est rapide, amicale et en plus, les serveurs/serveuses vont même chanter à votre table!

Le hamburger que j'ai mangé à deux occasions était très gros. Sans trop exagéré, je crois que mon hamburger était d'environ 8 pouces de circonférence. La galette est une demi livre mais il est possible de commander un hamburger de deux livres ! Le choix que j'ai pris avait du fromage bleu frit dans de l'huile et du saindoux, de la laitue, tomate et autres légumes. Il avait un choix spécial dans le menu avec des oeufs frit dans du gras.

Le spécial au déjeuner possède probablement les calories nécessaires afin de permettre à un être humain en bonne santé physique et mentale de survive plus de 48 heures. Vous avez droit à une méga tranche de bacon canadien salé et délicieux d'une livre cuit sur le grille et vous avez aussi le droit à trois œufs préparé selon votre choix sans oublier du pain avec une tonne de beurre chaud à volonté et probablement l'équivalant d'une livre de patates au four. J'ai facilement pris trois livres de plus avec ce déjeuner qui porte le surnom de ""graveyard"".J'ai bien aimé mon expérience culinaire américaine, malgré une forte accumulation de matière grasse dans mon organisme. 

Je crois que je vais retourner à mon prochain séjour à Las Vegas, Nevada (États-Unis).",2

Place was not crowded 3/4 tables, 2 servers one about to get off. You more or less seat yourself. Server was quick w/ drink order and what I wanted. She offered a dinner salad ($1.99 extra). Waited and waited for salad, never appear. She did manage the salad for the couple seated after me. When my order came I queried her about the salad..she was the perfect ""blond""..she giggled and said ""my bad"" I forgot..really. Asked if I wanted now I said no. The meal..Baked potato must of been cooked early in the morning..inside of the potato was dark brown. veggies luke warm and the steak..hey it's $5.99 you be the judge small, grissled..but it was cooked med rare. Maybe it was a bad night, don't know, but will reconsider in the future....If your looking for a low cost steak dinner, try 
""The Pub""..much better...so on food  1 and for service -5. You know not once did she even offer to re-fill my ice tea...which really pissed me off.",2

25642,3,1550620800000,"So as we walk into this place I was very skeptical to think that they would produce good food because on the outside all you see if the tree house and you kind of don't understand how to get in here but then we walked in and it finally made sense.we were celebrating our cousins birthday so there was four of us.

So let's start with appetizers we had the crab cakes which here they were your typical crab cakes nothing special but still tasted petty good.

Bone marrow!! I'm telling you it's the business here! They were served with mini toasted bagettes buttered on the grill and the little salad they had on the side was an awesome pairing.I would definitely order it again yummy!

So the waiter recommended that we try the 33oz wagyu tomahawk ribeye and I'm glad we ordered this steak. And for 88 bucks I expected another mediocre steak but boy was I wrong. I asked the waiter when the steak came out if I needed any sauces for this steak and I was thrown off on how he immediately said no trust me eat it as is.. the most awesome steak I've had in my life so far..I was so satisfied from first bite to finish and now look to have this steak on a regular.my wife also agreed and sister and cousin felt that was a phenomenal steak! Thank you so much for the experience

Our cousin and sister had the rack of lamb and for me I'm not too much of a lamb guy but they insisted that I try it and I was amazed because normally when I eat lamb it's too gamy for me but this was an awesome prepared lamb chop so thank you for that because it totally changed my perspective on lamb.

As for the sides that we enjoyed with our meal we had lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus and cream corn.they went with our meal and I will say my favorite thing was the cream corn and the recommended lobster mash felt like it was just your simple mash potatoes and gravy with lobster on top..still it was delicious

Since we were celebrating a birthday or waiter gave us the also recommended butter cake on the house which was very nice and I think the dessert is not as good as they say. but we all enjoyed it overall the steak is what I will come back for it was such a great meal.",2
47595,2,1550275200000,"Hands down my favourite sushi restaurant in Brampton. The sushi is fresh & you can opt for some Korean food as well. Most entrees come with soup , salad and small dishes.

25937,2,1549497600000,"The sausage pizza was very good.  The crust was thin but not too crispy - which is how I prefer my thin crust.  I'm no sausage expert but they say it's house-made and I believe them.  It tasted good enough to be such.  The pizzas are a lot of food for a good price, and if you have a light appetite, they can easily be shared. Hopefully the pizza is this good every time - other reviews note inconsistency in that regard, which sucks, because my pizza was one of the better I've had in a while.

The meatball pasta was a flub however.  The tomato sauce was overabundant and way too acidic.  The pasta was overcooked in some places and undercooked in others; about half of the pasta was what I would call properly cooked.  And the meatballs were mostly flavorless and mediocre.  The sauce issue is odd because the sauce on the pizza had just the right amount of sweetness, and I'm sure it's the same sauce.  I would be reluctant to order any dish off the menu where the sauce isn't tempered by massive amounts of cheese and other ingredients.

A companion's prosciutto pasta was delicious however.  It's the only pasta that features a non-tomato sauce, and they should change that.

The decor seems to be suffering from split-personality disorder.  Industrial-style exposed ductwork?  Yep.  ""Rustic"" Italian stucco from the homeland?  Yup.  Classic pizzeria-style red-checked table cloths? You betcha.  It's pleasant enough but they may have been trying too hard.  Scratch that - they were absolutely trying way too hard.  The only thing missing is translucent-green plastic squiggly things hanging randomly from the ceiling.  And fake tuxedo shirts - oh wait.

Overall, Luigi's is a nice addition to the area, but not a transcendent experience by any means.  A typical Food Fight restaurant.",3
43428,2,1551052800000,"Finally getting around to writing this review.  We normally come here as our pre game dinner spot before hitting the town.  Totally love the vibe of this place, really gets you in the mood.  They have a DJ that plays a lot of mixes that you hear from bars and clubs around .  This place gets super busy on weekends and sundays so expect to wait a bit.  We were told a 40 minute wait for our group of 7 so we waited at the bar, however it must have been a shorter time than that or time just flew while we were too busy having fun.  The hostess did inform me that we are able to call ahead for our party in the future so we can avoid waiting, will make sure to do so next time.   

I must say in the past the service has been so so or not too great,  which is probably why I never care to really write a review cuz my review would be mixed cuz I love this place and the food, but the service was ok.  However our server this time, Alleyne was awesome.  She was really friendly and patient with us.  She recommended we try one of the unfiltered sake, which of course after a couple shots I've now forgotten the name, it was yummy and not gross like I imagined sake to be.  We normally stick to the boring spicy tuna and california rolls, but she helped us pick out some other sushi rolls that were amazing.  My personal favorites was the salmon special and the Bye Bye Kitty.  Overall all our whole experience was fantastic because of her great customer service, thanks again to our server!! 

I highly recommend this place!!!",2

34785,3,1551052800000,"I have been here 3 times now, and every experience has been 5 stars, and its not just because Bobby Flay is my favorite Iron Chef. I had actually been craving the roasted chicken and brussel sprouts from my last visit (and I normally NEVER order chicken, but their preparation is so flavorful and moist), so imagine my disappointment when they were both absent from the menu.  However, this disappointment didn't last long when my perfectly prepared Fire Roasted Veal Chop was placed in front of me.  My husband and friend both ordered the 22 oz. rib-eye. If you order this, come hungry! We shared a couple delicious appetizers and sides, but even the bread alone is so delicious.  

My 2 year old daughter (who also has quite the palate) was with us and we were able to order from an off-menu children's dinner for $18.  We ordered the roasted chicken and mashed potatoes for her, and she enjoyed every bite.  It was such a refreshing change to have a beautifully presented child's meal, instead of the typical chicken fingers and french fries.

40479,3,1551312000000,What can I say about this place besides its the bomb!! There aren't a ton of options for eating downtown so anytime a new place opens up I check it out. This one hits the spot. Jerk chicken was cooked perfectly and the food was ready quickly which is important when you are eating on your lunch hour. Red stripe for lunch too? Yes please!,1
47796,3,1549843200000,"I have been climbing redrock canyon for more than a decade but I haven't tried this trail. I always pass by here but I have no idea how this hike is. We got there past 8am and started to navigate the trail while stopping in each and every beautiful flowers we saw to take pictures. We end up climbing a big rock on the left side to take pictures and while doing it we heard a rattle sound! I got scared! For the longest time I hike in redrock, that was the very first time I heard a rattle snake! Like everywhere else when you're  in a National Park you need to be careful and be mindful at all times. We left that site immediately and proceeded to the turtlehead peak. It was a slow ascent during the first 20 minutes. We were enjoying the cold breeze and the warmth of the sun. We stopped in the first midsize rock on the middle of the path. We can see the turtlehead peak on the right, the sky was blue and the chemical rays are quite fabulous! 

In the meantime we didn't really know the end part of the hike as we have no map. We are basically just following the people hiking before us. After a few minutes, oh boy the trail was getting harder and harder. It became a vertical hike. The trail is quite rocky and loose. Some part are full of gravel. It's quite dangerous. We tried to look for another way where more stable rocks to climb on but we ended up in a steep spots. Stay on the trail, do not look for short cuts as there are none. You will end up in a more dangerous spots. Stop and rest, drink water and don't rush. Always take your time and phase. 

We finally arrived on the top big rock at the last curve heading to the peak. We sat behind that rock to rest and few steps away is a beautiful view of the Canyon. From there is another 20 minutes to the peak depending on your phase. It took us at least a couple of hours to the top. The view is amazing. If you will do this hike, come prepared and never give up. If your halfway, might as well finish it. It's well worth it. 

After the scenic view, the cool breeze and the warmth of the sun, going down is another thing. It is quite grueling and uncomfortable. I got blisters on my feet. Going downhill requires a great balance and control. While it was a steep incline going up, what can you expect going downhill! Make sure your hiking shoes is your best hiking shoes. It took as an hour to go down. It was a fun and challenging hike. If you love to hike and haven't tried this trail, I highly recommend but remember to come prepared, bring enough water and some snacks. Wear sunblock. Rest when you need to. This is not for older people who are frail and not fit. For an experienced hiker this is moderate but for others it is quite a strenuous hike.",2

43006,2,1550534400000,"Hmm, I'd give Peppermint a 3.5 if allowed. The service was excellent I will say and I thought it was genius that our server served us our dishes family-style after listening to our conversation about tasting one-another's selections. Appetizers: The chicken potsticker was ordinary, but the shrimp in a blanket was excellent. Main Courses: Pepper Pike Treasure, Basil Rice, Chili Duck, and a Under the Sea (red curry). The favs were the Chili duck (fried to perfection) and Basil Rice (well-blended ingredients); the others were just ordinary Thai dishes to me. The red curry was not as balanced as I've had; the pepper and coconut milk were overdone (yes, these ingredients are the epitome of red curry, but so much so that that's all I could taste, I think not!). The portions are generous if that's your thing. Dessert: The Chocolate Banana spring rolls? were so-so.",2
34350,2,1551139200000,"There was certainly a ton of food going around tonight at Copacabana steakhouse. Waiters cut slabs of meat table side to the sounds of live spanish guitar. 

Of all the things I ate (and there were ALOT) the BBQ'd pineapples were the standout dish.  They are BBQd with cinnamon. HEAVENLY. 

The meat dishes kind of blended together.  I think I liked the flank steak the best. The chicken drum sticks were good too. 

I wasn't crazy about some of the flavour combinations, like the steak with parmesan cheese. Also, I found many of the cuts to be very fatty. Like mouthfuls of fat. I ended up taking another plate for the fatty bits.

The salad bar was good.

The corn muffin was yummy.

I didn't love the fried banana. 

All in all I say the atmosphere at Copacabana is fun, the food is ok. I came here for a birthday with a very large group. I think this is the right place for that.",3

49643,3,1549584000000,"This was my first foray into downtown Vegas as I usually stay and play on the strip. Stayed from Sunday to Monday this week and I definitely won't be back to this hotel.

It wasn't all bad. The good points were the employees...starting with phone reservations and then Dwayne was great at check in and Kelly was great at check out, all processes were fast and easy, and courteous. Though I do think it's kind of bogus that their check-in time is 4pm  and check-out is at 11am.  Parking is easy and complimentary. Our room was in the south tower on the 15th floor and it was a decent sized room, no complaints about the size as there was room to spread out. The last good thing was that they are kind enough to give you complimentary bottled water in the room. And the good ends there.

So glad this was only a one night stay. Starting with the walk to the room...the hallway had a weird smell (another review mentioned sewage smell), not horrible but a little off-putting. Also, everything is OLD, and needs to be completely renovated.

The room...it was not vacuumed or vacuumed well - there were a couple of huge pieces of, what, I don't know...looked like food...on the floor. Gross. Had to charge my phone, looked for an outlet - there was no useful outlet by the bed. The only outlet was by the dresser across from the bed and as it turned out, that outlet was controlled by the light switch by the door. And no light source was plugged into that outlet, go figure. Speaking of light - there is hardly any light in the room. There are only two lamps, one on the desk and one on the night stand - that's it. The light over the sink is dim and the one in the shower/toilet area is super dim. The lamp that was on the desk had no on/off switch, I totally had to unplug it from the power strip! Ridiculous.

The room is so basic. There are no amenities - no fridge, microwave, or enclosed closet. The AC is old and loud. The room is ugly and old, Carpet is poorly worn - burn marks or old gum stuck on it? Didn't want to get too close to investigate further. Stains, scuffs, and marks on all the old furniture and walls. There is no sheer curtain layer, you either have the curtains open or closed. The shower/toilet area is really small, you cannot be a larger person and close the door easily. The towels are old and like sandpaper. The sink, though modern, is too high. I am petite and the top of the sink came up to the middle of my torso - when washing my face the water was running down my arms because I couldn't bend down far enough over the sink. And because the sink is so tall and large, you can't lean over it enough to do your makeup well in the mirror. Annoying. 

Wanted ice in the morning, none was to be had - the machine was empty. Tried again 3 hours later on the way out of the hotel, still out. Come on...is it that hard???

My biggest gripe was that at 4am before going to bed I wanted to find out what time check out was - it wasn't written anywhere in the room so I called the front desk...did anyone answer? No. Yes, it's 4am but this is a hotel/casino in Las Vegas, right? I called 3x, no one ever answered, was just kept on hold. I finally called the bell desk, no answer. Called housekeeping, no answer, but transferred to ""hotel operator"" who finally picked up and answered my damn question. 

I might be back to downtown Vegas, but I definitely won't be back to The Plaza. Such a let down - you don't even get what you pay for here.",2

48137,3,1551312000000,"Now that I've had a couple of visits to Camelback Women's Health, a review is appropriate.  After finding them on an internet search for prenatal services, I called and spoke to a couple of women.  After answering many of my questions over a few calls, I was ready to make an appt.  ask me what my choice of Dr was and I simply ask them to set me up with the one they preferred... enter, Dr. Gregory DeSanto.

I was always told that picking your maternity doctor was quite the chore.  It's joked about in movies and a matter of stress for many women.  I'm a lil more laid back than the average woman about such matters but, after I met Dr. DeSanto, I really didn't see the need to go to a dozen different doctors and stress.  He's relaxing, knowledgeable and does things himself that other doctors pass off to technicians - like my ultrasound.  He did an excellent job explaining everything he was doing, getting great angles of my lil baby and even showing me the gender before others say they can tell.  It was the most amazing experience to see my lil guy flipping around!!  I'd heard other women say that their ultrasound tech didn't tell them much and actually had them worried by not talking and explaining things but, there was none of these issues with DeSanto.  I'm a fan of his calm demeanor and simple, easy-going approach to things.

The reason for taking away a star is that on both visits, I've felt there could be a lil more communication with the the ladies in the office.  The first visit, I told them on check-in that I had 2 appts and even wrote in the information on the sign-in sheet but, they never sent me down to my first appt.  I didn't know there's almost no wait time at this clinic, (unlike other doctor's offices) so I sat there waiting forever and finally ask when it was almost time for my 2nd appt. because I was afraid they were going to overlap.  Luckily, they were able to fit me in for my 1st appt after my 2nd appt but that whole situation could have easily been avoided with a lil more communication.  On the 2nd visit, after my weight/vitals check, I was told to that I needed to start a test but then she left me without any instructions on where to go or what to do after that test.  I think it was assumed I knew the drill already because I am in my 2nd trimester, but that was only my 2nd appt.  

Those lil glitches were barely noticeable though compared to the satisfaction I feel with the clinic overall.  

* Dr DeSanto is knowledgeable, calming and explains things well.  And Jamie was so helpful with many of my misc. questions and helping me get set-up!

* They have their own lab and ultrasound machine in their clinic so you don't have to run around, wait, or make separate appts for lab work!

* Everyone is friendly enough and it feels like a cozy, comfy environment.  

* There is little waiting time before your appt starts and they must keep gaps in the day because you can get in to see the Dr. in a timely manner.

I'll be back next month for my 6 month check-up!

See ya there!",2

So did we get seated - no, we had to wait for 5-10 min. Whyyyyyy? Not sure. We ordered - coffee is exceptionally strong- be aware. Took forever to get our meals. Service was slow - again, unsure why since there was not many people there. It took 25-30 min once we ordered. I had the chicken and waffles. Their take on it is - it's actually not a waffle but more of a French toast with an egg cooked in the middle of it. It was good but nothing fantastic- esp when we waited so long. Had to ask for coffee refill. As we left my friend asked me if it was a repeat. I quickly answered -  no way. So overall service that included a long wait for our meal, overall value/ price, & food quality/taste - totaled 2 stars. That was my experience.",2

After shopping around, I fell in love with their Eiffel chairs (Eames dupe). When I went into the store to see the product, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. For $40, it was a great deal.

It took a while to find someone who actually worked there. Most furniture stores have sales people walking around, this one didn't. There was one staff member standing at the cash register who eventually helped me out. True to the other reviews, they didn't have my item in stock. But he convinced me to order it through them & it would be ready for pick up within 4 days.

I originally already had a specific dog picked out before I got their because I was so excited, but it turned out that she was long gone. So the staff had showed me a different dog that was just recently put up in the website and it was the dog's first day up for adoption. So you pick a dog you would like to see and they kindly bring it out to you and your family. I like this system a lot, because in that case you're not overwhelmed with the choices of dogs and dogs are not overwhelmed with the adopters going in and out.  But as soon as I saw this dog I fell in love. He was sneezing from being excited!! But as soon as I saw him I knew I wanted to get him.

First impressions were pretty good - it is a cute spot in Baldwin village. It's cozy, unique atmosphere reminded me of some of the restaurants I've been in overseas, and I enjoyed this about it. The staff were also very nice, very willing to be of service, though unorganized it seemed. My boyfriends appetizer was wrong, and his steak was cooked to rare when he'd requested medium. 

We each had the Sangrita, which was nice. The appetizers and mains were quite underwhelming, especially after what I'd read. I had the duck, which what little meat was on the bone was mostly too hard to chew. The sauce was a citrus, but far too sweet and unsuited to the side dishes, in my opinion. My boyfriends steak was mostly uneaten - there seemed an imbalance in the marinade used. 

Cute little spot, and the staff was friendly and seemed keen on providing a good service. However, our experience was unfortunately not what we'd hoped for.",2

25788,2,1551139200000,"Say hello to the newest of DeSoto Central Market's creations.  An oyster bar serving a pretty wide variety of seafoods.  They were a little late in joining the DeSoto family, but finally came into the fold on May 9th, 2015.  Having sampled all of DeSoto's other creations, I figured I'd give this place a shot.  I should preface this review by saying that my rating is closer to a 3.5, but I'm rounding up largely because of Chef Pete.  Super classy guy who answered pretty much all of my questions and explained his rotating menu (though he didn't give up all his trade secrets).  The prices are such that I can't give this place a super high mark yet, but my first visit gives me plenty of reason to be hopeful of this new upstart.

Among the items on Walrus & The Pearl's food menu include different types of oysters, shrimps, as well as other fish species.  Among the menu items that caught my attention during my first visit here was their pokes.  I've heard of poke (pronounced po-kay for those unfamiliar), which I know is huge in Hawaii and parts of Asia, but I've never sampled it for myself.  Essentially pokes are small bowls of raw fish that are covered with sea salt and an array of various marinades.  Today I decided to have a Yellowfin Tuna Poke.

The menu doesn't mention what was in the poke other than the tuna, so I did my best to figure it out on my own.  Aside from sea salt, I picked up sriracha, lemon juice, pepper, parsley, and scallions.  Might've been a few other items in there, but that's what I could make out.  The portion was fairly modest (though plenty for lunch), but about what I expected based on seeing poke dishes on the Food Network.  Overall, I was a big fan of this dish.  The sriracha gave it a little bit of a kick without being too spicy and the tuna tasted good enough to be sushi grade (who knows, maybe it was).  I also got a glass of the Pinor Noir.  I was pretty happy as I was the first one to have their Pinot Noir so they opened the bottle in front of me.  Refreshing accompaniment to the poke for sure.

So back to the drawback of this place.  The prices.  Total tab for the poke, glass of Pinot Noir, tax and tip came to $35.  Granted, I ordered one of the more expensive wines on their list.  But still, $15 for a glass of wine is pretty steep.  Most of their drink offerings are around $10 or less so don't let my experience scare you off on that front.  The prices of the seafood items themselves pretty much vary on which type of seafood you get and how much of it.  And as I mentioned earlier, the food menu rotates depending on what they have available so bear that in mind.

Taken as a whole, Walrus & the Pearl has promise.  It remains to be seen whether this oyster bar/seafood restaurant concept can work when there are much cheaper offerings at DeSoto, but its certainly worth a try.  As mentioned Chef Pete is a super friendly guy and has been an apprentice of famed valley chef Stephen Jones (i.e. Blue Hound Kitchen, Yard Bird, etc.), so he's got the lineage to succeed.  Hopefully he's able to work out the menu to a price point that will make his oyster bar a regular mainstay for Downtown lunch and dinner crowds.  After all, taking risks are pretty much what every aspiring restauranteur at DeSoto is here to do.",2

I recently just got back from a whirlwind 2 night stay in sin city. The flamingo is so nice!! I really would not have thought the rooms were so cute, with pink and black decor everywhere, as well as it appears the entire hotel may have been recently remodeled. The pool is the selling point. I had a couple of friends staying at the venetian and they both raved how much better our pool was (with plenty of eye candy you wont remember once your picking your self respect off the bathroom floor of an unidentified hotel room...FYI- the bathroom floors are like REALLY hard T_T) Maybe i havent been to vegas is a while but HOLY WHOLE IN MY WALLET, everything is expensive! The first night we went pretty hard and needed to grab some eats; we headed to carlos n charlies (i think because it was the first food place i saw out of the elevator...) and ordered a chicken quesadilla and a cheeseburger. That was a $42 dinner. The next day I enjoyed a $13 lunch (for panda express type stuff). Pretty redic

Oh, you cant bring outside food or drink to the pool, NO BUENO. The drinks are $17-$24. And even if you buy it in the 'souvenir' cup you cant bring that cup back in the next day, you have to get a new one. Thats pretty weak yo. 

I've also never experienced a louder hotel room. We were on the 17th floor and could hear the street traffic all night. The floors are hardwood so maybe that played a roll but it was an odd sound since most of those hotels have sound proof windows...

All in all i really enjoyed my stay (that I can remember) and will return; probably soon since someones going to need to pay that VD bill from the doctor I will undoubtable have thanks to the pool. mmmm salty.",1

With all the construction and congestion surrounding downtown Chandler, the motivation to visit Urban Tea Loft was not there. But today, we decided to trek out there and see what the fuss is about. So glad we did. The menu, though not as vegetarian friendly as I hoped still had a great selection of delicious items to choose. I stuck to the Cold Trio Salad which is more of an appetizer but filing like a full meal. They substituted the chicken salad for the tuna salad (yes, I eat fish) and boy was it tasty. My boyfriend had the catfish sandwich with the side of potato salad. He could not stop raving about the sandwich. The ""house tea"" was a raspberry lychee blend that was simply terrific!

Our waitress was great. Very knowledgeable and attentive. From the time we ordered it was 45 mins until we got our food.

She alerted the manager as we did not complain, just asked for our drinks.  Drinks came and then our entrees.  Our server came by a couple times and apologized but was still very weak at his job.  Hopefully he is given another chance and receives more training before his next guest arrives.  The 5 stars go to Kelli though for just coming out of nowhere and comping our meal.

46465,2,1549065600000,"We were in the university area around lunch time and had read so many good reviews we had to stop.  Overall it was good and would like to try it again.  

Food -   So many options on the menu.  Everything looked so good.  The waitress was helpful with our questions and help narrow it down.  So here is what we decided on:

- Combination appetizer.  We picked Hummus, Dolmades and Falafels.   I would say that the Dolmades were the best.  They practically melted in your mouth.  Hummus was second best that had a very smooth consistency.  Finally the Falafel.  Personally I think that it was a little over done. 

- Chicken Swarma wrap.  My wife had this and thought it was good.  I had a bite  and thought it was also good.  

- Gyro Wrap.  This was my second choice as they didn't have Lamb Swarma.  Not sure how that happens but the Gyro was good.  The meat wasn't as seasoned as what I have had in the past but it was good.  

Service-   So we were pretty disappointed with the service.   The restaurant was moderately busy but they only had one waitress.  I don't blame her because she was running the entire time.   It's really bad that she was put in that situation.  

Overall I would try it again.  Probably would try an entree next time (waitresses original suggestion).",2

Our table started off with the Montezuma chips and salsa. I'm a total chicken when it comes to spice, but the salsa was so good I kept on eating even though my mouth was on fire. The chips were fresh and still warm when they got to table, which is always appreciated. I had the duck carnitas, pork belly and the short rib tacos. Definitely do the pork belly! My friend loved her crispy avocado tacos. 

Their drink menu is quite unique and it'll be fun to go back and try more. Our table had the Bolo de Coco (do this if you're a fan of coconut and banana), a margarita on the rocks with pineapple, La Calavera (huge shared drink) and the Loma Bonita, which was my favorite. The grapefruit soda in this was perfect - tart, fizzy and full flavored.

Service 4.5/5 -- Although both experiences were very different, I experienced positive customer service. There's a server there who is extremely helpful who served us the first time... He's the guy who also works at Firefly! 

My second time I sat at the bar to eat and had a bartender on our side who was busy. He was an older gentleman with white hair. He was quite inattentive with us and I understand how busy it was (I work in the restaurant business as well) but I really found it hard to capture his attention, especially when I was ready to order things. I personally felt like he skipped over us and couldn't even give us a ""okay, be right there"" type of response. He did end up noticing that I was probably slightly irritated and offered us free shots and a drink. The fact that he acknowledged it made me feel better about the service and the free things just made my experience way better!

Price 4/5 -- it's like $11-14 for three tacos. They're pretty delicious, though, and the food comes with delicious rice and beans and chips and salsa. It was $10ish for the Blood Orange Magarita. 

Food 4.5/5 -- the tacos are delicious! I had the pollo and carne asada tacos. I am a huge fan with how fresh it tasted! The meat wasn't dry like some other places and the tacos had the right flavors. The Spanish rice that comes with your meal was also sooooooo delicious. I sometimes crave it! The guacamole is delicious as well! Yummy yummy. The salsa is free and yummy as well!

I ordered the blood orange margarita and it was so delicious! Does it even have any alcohol?! I could drink it like juice. The tequila shots we ordered were in the cutest cups too. 

Overall, positive experiences despite the little hiccups in the beginning. Food and drinks are yummy but a little on the pricy side. I would come back here every now and then and definitely recommend their margaritas!",2

40809,3,1550275200000,"I really want to like this restaurant!

 I eat out 3-4 times a week. I have been to the ""eel"" at least 6 times over the last 1.5 years. The food quality has been steadily declining. My wife and I love sushi and Teppan style of food. We generally spend $50-75 for the two of us. 

We went to dinner with our neighbors there last night. The place was practically empty. We sat at the Teppan table because the people we were dining with wanted some Teppan. We all ordered sushi and I wanted to add a chicken fried rice for a side order since we were sitting at the Teppan table. The server, who was nice, advised me you could no longer just order chicken fried rice at the Teppan table. The owner, Barry, said he couldn't sell his chicken fried rice that cheap without ordering a meal. I explained that I was drinking an expensive sake and I had personally ordered $25.00 in sushi. He actually debated with me for about 10 minutes about how he could not make any exceptions and I would have to order it from the kitchen. I advised him that I would pay kitchen price and I just wanted the experience of having it cooked at the table. The owner, Barry, said he would make an exception this time, but when the Teppan chef started cooking there was no fried rice. 

In the mean time the sushi started rolling out and it was the most pathetic tasting and smelling sushi I have ever had at a moderately expensive restaurant. I practically had to choke it down (albacore and toro) to get past the fishy taste. 

When the fried rice came from the kitchen it was decent, but very bland. I had a stomach ache last night and did not feel well all day. I was compelled to join yelp to avoid future problems for other diners. 

Cheers!",2

I'd have to agree with some of the other people here that the drink prices seemed high, even for Vegas.  A little too much fog & smoke & the layout makes it hard to move around the place when it's full.  The bouncer staff was outstanding, though -- they get 5 stars in my book (unsure if it was because we had more girls than guys in our group, but whatever).  Our waitress rocked, too (pardon the pun), she checked on us constantly, stopped to talk to us like real customers, so we never really wanted for anything.

While they are almost always quick and attentive, some need a bit more personality and a smileV
Anyways, the food is really great!  Each meal begins with warm chips and home made salsa.  Their salsa tastes fresh and is more heavy on the cilantro.  I really like how there is not huge chuncks of tomatoes or onions.  They have a wide array of chicken, seafood beef and vegetarian dishes.  My favorite meal to order is the Quesadilla Verde.  It is a tortilla stuffed with cheese, avacado, peppers, lettuce and I always add some beans in there.  As for an appetizer, the chorizo and queso dip is amazing.  Warm melted cheese and spanish sausage is served with warm tortillas for dipping.  Cozumel also has many margarita flavors and delicious cocktails.",2

She stated  ""no just today"" So I am like okay can you refund me, and she did, we waited 40 minutes, many people got served, we thought maybe they phoned ordered to eat in or something

Then I got up and waited to place order for two more takeout dinners, for family at home
So I am like I would like to order some takeout, but I am scared, because we are still waiting for the order for here. The same girl asked what our order number was. then did back and forth with the kitchen, and started to speak in Arabic, but I could tell by the tone that this was going me make very annoyed, what she is about to tell me.
She did something with the order when she refunded me for the Bolani, and the Back 
( kitchen ) never prepared my order., the chit never printed or was not handed to the back.
Not a single apology!

I am beyond annoyed at this point, we were starving by then. At last one guy comes from the back sees our receipt, acknowledges that it has been way too long, my exact order was ready, but I guess it was for someone else, but he grabbed it from the girl's hand, & he is like ""start with this"".

Now a gentleman comes from behind, and asks if the order was his. The girl goes yes, go ahead, like whoa! Is she asleep? The chef just told me to start with this.
Now he is looking at me. Awkward as it can be, he is like is this your order? because he heard the whole conversation, I am like just take it. 

Then we waited for 15 more minutes, our food arrived with 2 comp puddings (that I could not careless about, but the pudding was damn good) 

NOTE TO THE OWNER: 
PLEASE TRAIN YOUR STAFF, also train them to apologize first and foremost, and then offer to comp the food, by giving pudding away without speaking to the customer does not solve anything. The girl at the counter had a horrible attitude, Nobody from the counter realized that a table was sitting and waiting without any food for 45 minutes?
Nobody cares? It boggles my mind!

 If you are not in the business to make your customers HAPPY, by compensating them for a blunder your staff made , at least APOLOGIES!!!  trust me it WORKS.

PS. I was not looking for free food, spent around $80 bucks or more ! it's the thought and correcting an error properly what counts.

23276,1,1548979200000,"I went here on a Wednesday for their Finger Lickin Chicken specials that are all say on Wednesdays. I heard that SOHO made their mark with their infamous fried chicken so I had to try it! The chicken pieces are a la carte. You can get a chicken breast for $4.50, thigh $3.50, and it's even cheaper for the drumstick or wing! You have a choice of mild or spicy, and the side dishes are $3.50 (smoked Gouda mac n cheese, spicy collard greens, waffles, mashed potatoes and gravy and more!).

Now let's get to the meat of this review. The chicken was definitely finger lickin' good! I got the spicy chicken thigh. It was probably a little bit bigger than my fist when it arrived with a side of spicy collard greens. I instantly thought for sure there was a bone in it. As I cut into it and took my first bite, it was so juicy and flavorful! The breading was so delicious that I went in for the kill. I took my knife to it a few more times in search of the bone just to realize... There was no bone! OMG... This is just a big piece of perfectly fried delicious chicken! Wow... I'm speechless... Maybe it's because my mouth was completely stuffed with chicken and collard greens. But I devoured every piece, crumb and juice of it! Yum!!!

If this review was for the chicken, it would get 5 stars. However, the review is on the restaurant. Where they lost a star is the service. The service was slow... We waited over 20 minutes for the server to come back to our table to take our order, and it wasn't that busy in there like you might think! It also took the server awhile to come back to our table after we were all done eating to give us our checks. When she did finally give us our bill, she gave my friends another table's bill.

Now, I understand that service may not always be consistent for various reasons. Maybe they were just short-staffed or having a bad day. So I won't let this deter me from coming back to Finger Lickin' Chicken Wednesdays! I'll recommend it to anyone, and maybe I'll see you there!",1

The points people make about the cost are somewhat valid, but this isn't a taqueria, this is much more of a chef driven better quality restaurant. Puerco ahumado was $15, but for a huge portion of smoked pork in a mole`. Great taste. At $11 for 2 the tacos are overpriced, but are high quality so you are getting what you pay for. My usual taqueria has all tacos for $1.30, so I feel the price point issue like everyone else.
These are modern/upscale versions of Mexican food, so don't come here and expect it to be ""authentic"" (see my comment about $1.30 tacos above for my idea of Mexican American food, but there are lots of variations on Mexican cuisine, including fine dining in Mexico so what really is ""authentic""?).
Nice place, communal seating, very nice looking antique-ish back bar, and very good service make this place worth checking out. The drinks are interesting, and they have a massive selection of tequilas (up to $100) to try if you're interested in something other than Jose Cuervo.

Humble Pie is a welcome neighborhood place for me to get a quick fix (without the lines of Bianco).

Both times I was there, i was surprised to see that the place clears out by 9PM, because its the kind of place you could go to drink wine and nosh. Its not a ""bar"" scene, but I like it to meet my girlfriends.

In both cases, the service was great. This last time, I swear our server has ESP, the minute I thought something, she was there. We were at a table that was getting a little wet from the misters. The minute we sat down, she saw me look up and there she was, moving our table so neither us nor our food would get wet. (I DID wonder why there was a table there to begin with, but, whatever.) We took foreeeeeeeeeever to order our food, and when we finally did decide, BOOM, there she was. That's hard to do when you have a table like us that is definitely on its own pace.

We walked in on a Saturday before a show at Hilarities and they were able to seat us without a reservation, which we knew was good luck. We started with the prototype, a new spaetzle dish seasoned and in a light cheese sauce. It was delicious and tasted like elevated Thanksgiving stuffing. My wife doesn't eat pork so we were a little disappointed there weren't more seafood options. The market fish was the only seafood dinner offered. The mahi-mahi was excellent but expect a small portion. We actually ordered an appetizer when we got to our show b/c we were still hungry after dinner.

Had the gnocchi bolognese and a pizza, both were excellent. Finished with a cannoli. (cannolo?)

So yeah, food was really really good, our server was super nice but he just didn't seem very experienced.

The place was packed for dinner, so I sat at the bar.  They have two bars, one in front, one in the other side of the restaurant.  The place was very busy, and pretty loud.  That's fine, it's just that kind of place.  The sidewalk patio seating looked GREAT but, it was full so, I couldn't enjoy the people watching.

I ordered the special, based on recommendation from the bar tender, the Tuna Wrap.  It was basically a tuna sandwich in a tortilla....sounds lame

but, it wasn't.  the Tuna salad was very nicely spiced and the wrap was quite good.  Very generous portion but, I was hungry!!! what could I do?  I ate the whole darn thing (oink oink)

The beer selection was nice, with a variety of local brews, as well as commercial taps and specialty beers.

Service at the bar was good.  The bartender was VERY experienced and knew what he was doing.  Friendly, good at small talk but, not annoying and bothering too much.

The ambiance....meh.  Take it or leave it.  Too ""themed"" for my own tastes but, that's just the kind of place it is.  I would definitely come here again, especially with friends for dinner before night on the town

Someone got me a gift card for HB. I checked on their website to learn about the place... looked at the menu... checked the hours... checked the events page... and invited friends to join us there.

When we got there the hostess told us it was only a buffet because it was Sunday. On the website is listed the buffet as ending at 6. Online it said full menu also available. It was both after 6... and the hostess most certainly said they only had the buffet. I asked what was on the buffet. The hostess said there was a list of foods on the website. I had not seen such a list on their website. Also,  I'm standing in the restaurant - why tell me to go on the internet? They never offered for us to look at the buffet which I thought would have been an obvious thing to do. Since my friend was a vegetarian and we could not discover what was on the buffet... we thought we would see what was available outside, which has a limited menu. 

stupidly... outside you cannot use a gift card.

we left. Inexplicably there was some sort of puppy adoption going on with puppys running underfoot and happy people watching the puppys and not looking where they were going. :D :D Hah! I liked the puppies. I would like to rate the puppies -  6 stars.

 i sent an email to the restaurant asking if the food could be paid for inside with the gc and just obtained outside... no response. 

It looks really nice in there and i hope you enjoy it but we were perplexed. The management should have better info on the website about what is going on. and a gift card should be accepted at the whole establishment. A business should also respond to questions. 

I've been to the Hofbraukeller in Munich and didn't expect this to be similar, but I do like things to make sense. Still it is a nice addition to CLE and playhouse square.

I'm assuming they don't use any seasoning. It wasn't even worth eating because it lacked in flavor. Husband ordered a shawarma sandwich which he was happy with (but he's not picky). We ordered a rice pudding because I didn't eat my meal. That was also very bland and very obviously wasn't fresh. There were still frozen pieces of rice in it. I will not be coming back here again. I also didn't like that the owner pestered my husband about why his parents don't go there anymore. He didn't know what to say so after she kept asking, I decided to reply for him. When I said ""they live 30 minutes away,"" she replied ""so do I and I come here every day"" in a snotty manner. Maybe they don't go there because their food is awful and the owner is rude.

We had a get together at this restaurant on a late Monday afternoon. We made reservation so they had a table ready for us. 

The interior is a bit dated as you walk in but they have a patio area at the side. We were seated inside at the back of the restaurant and because of the time of the reservation, we were pretty much by ourselves. Parking is available on the side streets or nearby P lots. 

The Good: The Tiropita was very good with the different kind of spreads and pitas. There's a free complementary bread that's provided on the table. 
The Greek Paella has a good amount of shrimp, mussels, sausages and chicken. 

Service was great. Our waiter was very attentive to our group and we were well taken care of. 

The Average: I wasn't crazy with the tomato based sauce on the paella. I'm used to the paella having the saffron flavour which this dish did not. Prices seems on the high side. 

I will come back to try their other dishes.

28719,2,1549497600000,"Great hotel with a superb bar and restaurant (Sushi Roku), but our stay was heavily tarnished by our experience of the pool...

Unfortunately, the W has cashed in on the Vegas party pool idea and lets wannabes who aren't staying in the hotel turn up and reserve the loungers. This meant that I had to pay $50 for my gf and I to lie in the sun.

You would have thought that paying guests would get priority, but it seems like every skank and db in Scottsdale is more important.",2
39444,3,1551139200000,"This place is adorable. It's surrounded by an abundance of other shops and stores. My fellow helpers pictures are definitely what got me to take the trip here. Upon arrival I was instantly overjoyed and overwhelmed with all the tasty looking choices. I some how settled on 3 cookies and 2 cupcakes while my companion had 3 other cookies for me to taste. 

Chocolate chip: the classic, my go to... boy am I salty that this didn't work out. Literally. There was so much salt and butter... yuck yuck couldn't finish it. Every bite made me reach for water. 

Snickerdoodle: very yummy very soft, possibly a tad too much cinnamon but not to the point where this is a real complaint

Reese's: OMG! So soft. So delicious. So amazing. Definitely #1 for this visit. My heart couldn't be happier. Biting into this was a piece of heaven.

S'mores : equally soft as the Reese's. Very good I would totally suggest this. 

Now on to things I personally didn't taste but got rave reviews from others. When I arrived to work, I asked my father did he want to try one  of my cookies, he responded no and I continued inside to wash my hands. Next thing I know, he's walking by me with crumbs in his hands and looks at me like a sad puppy. ""Sorry, I owe you a sugar cookie""

Clearly it was good. 

Last was the red velvet cupcake. It was love at first bite for my coworker. He fluttered his eyelashes like a cartoon character in love. He savored every bite. If any crumbs hit his shirt, he was sure to scoop those up too. 

I can't wait to indulge in this sugar bliss again",3
22796,1,1550361600000,So delicious! We love this place. Will definitely make it a regular brunch spot when we are in town. The eggs were delicious. The bacon was unique but so good. There wasn't a potato left on any of our plates. The drinks were very good as well. Highly recommend !,2
38814,1,1549584000000,The management at this place is terrible.  We reserved a table for the Superbowl but our Hispanic friends from Seattle could not reserve one and were not provided with any reason that made any sense. Obviously racism is alive and well at the Wasted Grain.,2
26615,1,1549324800000,"Delicious original dishes but probably not worth the money. Much better value at other high-end restaurants for example, Sage at Aria. 
The bread was absolutely fantastic as was the spiny lobster with stuffed calamari. A very memorable meal.",1
25467,1,1550880000000,"Great selection of meats, veggies, and seafood here! We came here for late night happy hour and service was pretty good. The appetizers we order was the chili dumplings and steamed egg. Both were delicious! As for the grill meats everything was flavorable. My favorite was the pork belly and beef tongue. Would come back again next time!",1
38634,1,1550188800000,$16-$20 for a combo. Not worth it at all. Spend that money doing something productive like buying groceries and then making sandwiches yourself instead of giving this place an arm and a leg.,3
46638,3,1550102400000,"Had been wanting to go for several weeks. Finally decided to make the trek over to the other side of town to check out the shopping and the restaurants. The wait was not lawn and the atmosphere is beyond great. The Decour is very appropriate very fun and very different.

My husband had a margarita and said it was great my drink was not great asked the waitress to replace it and she replaced it with a different drink that was excellent no problems.

Our food was hot and serve very well ..tasted very good I had the teriyaki chicken with double vegetables my husband had the avocado burger turkey burger with a side salad it was all fresh good hot.

The band was fun and they were just getting started when we left would've liked to of stayed and enjoyed it a little bit longer. But there was no rush for us to get out service was great not an issue. I personally highly recommend this restaurant",2
35901,1,1549756800000,"Haven't eaten here in a few years. It was suprising and refreshing to see the change in the decor. I picked up an order to go. The green curry chicken was amazing, deserving of over 5 stars if that where possible. The ginger beef is a bit soupy but,overall when mixed with rice and the veggies that accompany the meat, it makes for a good dish. As for the pad Thai I got sea food I'm unsure if indicating shrimp would've got me a shrimp pad Thai but the pad Thai I got had a mixture of crab meat and shrimp. Which made for an amazing meal.",1
28922,2,1550448000000,"I actually liked the location of the hotel and the room was huge and pretty nice. But the room is pretty dirty compared to other hotels with the same rating. The pool is kind of in an awkward location because people from the lobby and the mall can see you, which to me is pretty strange and a bad layout. 
I would have recommended this place because I thought it was pretty decent hotel for the size, location, and price, BUT we were billed for smoking in the room when NO ONE smoked in the room. Only one person staying in the room smoked, and he were aware that it was a non-smoking facility and knew that we would be billed if he smoked in the room, and, therefore, he didn't. But I guess he threw away his empty pack of cigarettes in the room and they considered it smoking in the room. We tried to contest the charge, but they kept telling us that they had evidence but would not disclose what evidence it was. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!! Spend some more and stay at the Venetian or another hotel, this place isn't worth it!",2
49977,2,1549152000000,"San Francisco grilled cheese with chicken... One of the tastiest I've ever had. Gotta come by and check this place out. Nothing bad to say about this place. Great neighborhood bar and all around great staff. Come by and see Johnny, George (or El Jorge as I call him), Franco, Kat and the rest of the gang. It's always a good time.",3
