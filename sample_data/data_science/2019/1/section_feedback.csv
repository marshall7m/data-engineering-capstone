2,2,1547510400000,"Oh happy day, finally have a Canes near my casa. Yes just as others are griping about the Drive thru is packed just like most of the other canes in the area but I like to go sit down to enjoy my chicken. The cashiers are pleasant and as far as food wise i have yet to receive any funky chicken. The clean up crew zips around the dining area constantly so it's usually well kept. My only gripe is the one fella with Red hair he makes the rounds while cleaning but no smile or personality a few nights ago he tossed the napkins i just put on the table to help go with my meal. After I was done he just reached for my tray no ""excuse me or are you done with that?""  I realize he's trying to do his job quickly but a little table manners goes along way. That being said still like to grub here and glad that there's finally a Cane's close to me.",1
3,1,1548720000000,"Really good place with simple decor, amazing food and great hospitality.
Very impressed with the lunch portion. Although service took little extra time but I have no complaints since they are quite new in business. The green curry chicken was good and to the right spice balance I asked for. I will definitely recommend this place to others.",2
4,1,1548288000000,"I have been here twice. Very nice and laid back. I tried the weekend Southern menu and it was delicious! Collard greens, mac&cheese, ribs, BBQ chicken sandwich. The scone with clotted cream was divine!!!! The iced teas are very refreshing and I swear I drank a whole container myself both visits. 
The second time I had soup, salad and a sandwich. The salad had this amazing (raspberry? strawberry?, I forgot) vinaigrette. The sandwich was good, but I was kind of disappointed with the soup. It was potato and tasted too ""milky"". 
They change the menu often and now have a tea inspired one. Can't wait to go back and try it.
The owners are very nice and I hope they continue to do well.",2
4,3,1546992000000,"ORDER In (Delivery) Review

I discovered this place from the front desk of the airport hotel and they recommended it highly. I called to place my order for Delivery to my room. They were very accommodating.

Won Ton Soup - nice broth and tender won tons.

Chicken with Diced vegetables and Cashews - again, fresh vegetables were used, and good sized pieces of chicken.

Crispy Beef - much like a Ginger Beef, nice serving of Beef with a sweet chilli sauce. Very tasty.

Broccoli in Garlic sauce - came with peppers,Onions , Broccoli was not over done.

All in all for Delivery , this was really good. I am used to going to Authentic Asian in Vancouver. This hit the spot, and they also sent me a nice tub of Chilli Oil because I like it Hot.",2
7,2,1548288000000,"My husband and I go there once a week since last year. We LOVE seafood. Unfortunately, I regretfully say that this place is a hit and miss for us. Some weeks are good, fresh and saucy. Some weeks can be completely opposite. I never thought about writing a review until our experience last week. 
We ordered medium chicken wings and hot trifecta 2 lbs of shrimp. The wings came out SUPER spicy (probably hot) and the shrimp came out plain ( 99% butter and 1% spices). When we ordered we asked to make sure we have enough sauce but they came in almost dry. My husband and I love this place but we just never know what we will get that night. We just dodge the bullet and hopefully they will be better than last week.",2
14,1,1546473600000,"A very busy restaurant, make reservations, but well worth it.    Our party ordered the short ribs, salmon and steam bass for our main entrees and each dish was outstanding.   Will definitely go back to this restaurant when we are back in the Phoenix area.",2

23,2,1547424000000,"We drive by Fruits and Roots almost daily and we finally decided to give it a try. Unfortunately the only good thing I have to say about the place is it has nice decor. We walked in and was greeted by one of the girls and as we were looking at the menu she asked if it was our first time and we told her yes. We assumed she would explain the menu but nope! My daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and I asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. So we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. My husband and I knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so as
we looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made. So we went with one that was made with acai but it had blueberries which we don't like and we weee hesistant to ask if they would be able to leave them out since everything seemed to be pre made but my husband did ask and luckily she said they could leave it out. Whew! It wasn't a long wait to get our order. My daughter drank her smoothie saying it was okay and our acai bowl was okay as well. To
me the best part was the granola and that's about it. At least we can say we finally tried this place and we definitely won't be back. We will be sticking to our usual spot Bowlology!",1

25,3,1548806400000,I went into this store yesterday and it was horrible!!! It was sooooo dirty. I'm talking there was trash everywhere!!!  Not only that but it smelled like trash! It was 5 o'clock on a Friday afternoon so I completely understand it being a little messy but the store just looked horrible!!! Not to mention the were out of pretty much everything on the store. I honestly will probably start going down the road to the next Smith's.,2
29,2,1546300800000,"Huge breakfasts served all day. ""the all American"" was very good if you want something simple. Service was spotty mostly because the waiters would disappear when we needed their attention. They were able to separate the checks which was great. The waffle was forgettable and expensive. I recommend egg dishes! If you need a quick yummy breakfast in downtown I recommend this.",1
31,3,1548547200000,"I just want to note that I am all about eating quality sushi. I have been to many sushi places  and I know when the sushi is worth the money. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.  The presentation of the sushi is clean and organized but the quality of taste was not there. 

We ordered the Godzilla and  10 orders of sake nigiri and 10 order of shrimp nigiri. I was disappointed. It was not fresh enough for my taste and not good enough for the money I spent there. The fresh sushi was flavorless and the rolls did not have a correct balance of flavor. 

If you guys are big sushi fans and know the difference between great sushi, good sushi and poor sushi, then this is place in not for you. But if you do like spending $5 on one piece of Nigiri/sashimi (not even a set of two) cause you won big in the casino or something, then be my guest.",2

37,3,1547856000000,This place is clean and a great price the other places around is are horrible and have undesirable types (I.e. hookers) not here safe and quiet no bedbugs a huge plus would recommend it to anyone unless you are from the Phoenix area they will not rent to you unless you live more than 30 miles away after our 3rd stay we were informed of this policy such is stupid and discrimination of Phoenix and surrounding area residents so I'm going to file a complaint with corporate and talk to my lawyer!,2
43,3,1547251200000,"I went to a Spring Training game here on Monday 3/17/14.  The stadium is just off the freeway so I arrived in the area about 75 minutes before the game.  The traffic was backed up on the freeway and the main street was a mess.  I waited almost an hour to get to what I thought was the parking lot only to find out it was the parking for the local Marriott.  People were very frustrated cutting others off in traffic, being aggressive and I witnessed a road rage incident while sitting in the line.  By the time I made it to the Marriott lot, they had been out of spaces for 15 minutes but they did not have a method to notify people.  I blame the Marriot for most of the mess but the City of Tempe need to plan better for events.
Inside the stadium I found the place to be less than average for Spring Training games.  The food was not good, the customer service was average and we could not hear the speakers very well.  I will stick to other Spring Training facilities to see some games in the future.",2
45,1,1548720000000,"I must have walked by this place a thousand times working on the square. Never knew what it was exactly. Came up in a search of ""Asian "" ? Amway, saw the reviews and walked over. The buffalo paninis with a side of black bean and corn salsa was very good. At $7 the price was fair, I think the yelp menu may be outdated. The desert case looked great and they have breakfast items also. There was a gift area too. Cool place and I'm far from vegan.",2
45,3,1548720000000,"My absolutely favorite mushroom pizza in the city, Great brunch spot - really reasonable and you can always get a table, because it's really big and has indoor and outdoor space.  I think the ice cream is homeade.  A neighbourhood favorite!",2

Our food came to our table at one and it was all HOT! 
Everyone received the correct food, our drinks were maintained full, and the amount of food was generous. 
We order fish, shrimp, broiled items, & steaks. Smiles all around.  
I WILL return whenever I visit the Charlotte area.",2
51,1,1548460800000,"Came here on a Saturday for dinner.. there was a wait for a table so we decided to sit at the bar for a drink until the table was ready.
Ended up ordering food at the bar and giving away our table because Emily was so cool!!
Seriously, my favorite bartender. EVER.
Attentive but not annoying.
Handled everything (being the only bartender there) very well.. timely and efficiently.

Drinks: Moscow Mule and Vietnamese Donkey
BOTH SO GOOD.

Food: Lobster Pho.. 5 stars. Delicious
Ox Tail Fried Rice: 5 stars. Really good, and actually had good chunks of meat and a yummy over easy egg on top. 
Fried calamari: big portion (we had leftovers) really good kinda spicy dipping sauce! 

Overall, 5 million stars",2
57,1,1547424000000,Table of 3 on Saturday March 25 around 8pm.. Well the service was terrible. . the host this night took us to a dirty table. . that waitress brung one glass of water when clearly all 3 were empty.

The restaurant is beautiful. Great outdoor and indoor space. Kombucha on tap! 

The have a separate window for takeout orders. They have a 2 different family meals, a larger one and a smaller one. The regular family $39 for chicken and it comes with 3 large sides of your choosing. The larger meal comes with 4 large sides. 

The chicken was chicken breast cut into slices. The three sides I got were the sweet potatoes (4 stars), the Indian cauliflower (4 stars), and the corn quinoa( 5 stars). The quinoa corn creamy concoction is like crack.  

I love when places have family meals like this!",2
65,3,1547337600000,"I called Garcia Bail Bonds and when the call was answered I was greeted ""Speak""... I proceeded to ask a question about the type of bond I was looking for. The reply was an angry ""what the hell are you talking about?"" I let the person answering know they must not want to make any money talking to customers like that and hung up.

I may not have known what I was talking about since I have never had to bail anyone out before, however the three other bail bonds companies I called prior with the same question were able to provide me an answer minus the horrible attitude.

Why would I ever set foot in a business who can't even handle the simple task of answering a phone call.


Update* In response to the reply.

A. Of course you are "" lost why I feel that way."" You think its normal to answer a phone call  at a place of business with the greeting ""Speak"" and reply to questions with ""what the hell are you talking about""'

B. You do not remember anything. I never said anything about 3% or California. I ONLY asked for a specific type of bond, (because not all bond companies are able to provide this specific type of bond) and your reply was ""what the hell are you talking about"". After that short conversation I terminated our conversation as stated in my review, so there was NO talk of California or 3%. I only included my experience with other bail bonds companies in my REVIEW to highlight how easy it was for me to call another business and not be treated so rudely. 

C. Thank you for letting me know how poor your customer service is so quickly. Made the decision to go else where easy. I write this in hopes that someone else will not get stuck with your company before they get a taste of your horrible customer service.",2
70,2,1548547200000,"Ok so I've come here a couple times for breakfast the first time my order was wrong I figured a fluke, I go again and yet again my order is wrong. Sucks because it's close to my job and I like it but I doubt I'll come back to this location. Nothing worse than having your food wrong.",2
75,2,1547337600000,"High price, low quality and bad taste. It's not Chinese food nor American food. Don't recommend it.",2
79,1,1548201600000,"The place is overcrowded with kitschy things on the walls and in every corner. We also noticed all the flowers outside were fake and pretty worn out, which made the place look ridiculous, cheap, and unkempt. So for environment, we would rate it a 2 star.We placed our order online, which was convenient, but when we showed up to pick up our food the place was dead and we couldn't find anyone to help us. Two employees actually made eye contact with us and then went right back to talking and slacking off. After about 10 minutes, someone did finally wander up front to get us our order. 

We ordered the stuffed mushrooms, Penne San Remo, stuffed shells, and chocolate chip cannolis. The meal came with french bread but the bread was stale and cold. The mushrooms weren't too bad. The sauce was tasty but the stuffing overpowered the mushrooms so it ended up tasting like sharp cheese and sauce. The penne san remo is supposed to contain artichoke but we only found two chunks of artichoke out of a container with enough food to feed 3 people. So that was disappointing. The sauce was also really bland and the chicken was overcooked/rubbery. The stuffed shells were ok, no major issues, they just weren't worth the price. Actually, none of the food we got was worth the price. We paid over 60 dollars for a dinner that was maybe worth 30. All in all we weren't impressed and won't be returning.",2

82,1,1548720000000,"I'm so sorry to do this to you Capitano and while I love your food most of the time, there are some inconsistencies.  I still want to go here and will come back again soon, but I've probably been here close to 10 minutes and 7 times were phenomenal, 1 time was average, another was slightly below average and 1 was quite dismal.  The last time I came here, while they tried to accommodate me and fix the issue, the fries were hard and not salted enough and the burger tasted very bad.  This is rare and that's why I'm only docking one star, but for some reason, one of the fry cooks didn't add salt to the fries and they always have before.  The cashier said you could ask for salt, but what frustrated me is that they were always perfectly salted before and while I understand some people will say it's too salty, you can't go from quite salty to no salt at all. That's quite the change.  I have to say, all the bad times I was there, there was one consistency on who was making the food, but I don't want to say who, as they are making a living.  

While I love you Capitano, I really hope you can be more consistent.  However, gelato is still da bomb.  Love the mojito.",2
83,3,1547164800000,"Good service. Food ok. All around this restaurant was just ok. I'm not an Indian food expert, but have enjoyed many Indian restaurants in different cities.

The atmosphere was pleasant and the service was very friendly and attentive.",2
93,2,1547942400000,"Excellent place if you are walking down Wellington and feel like fish and chips with beer. We went on a bike ride on the first beautiful day of the year and ended up visiting a friend in Verdun. We already know the other Comptoir 21 locations at the Latine Quarter and the Mile-End - but I like this one best. We sat outside (for the first time this year!) and really relished the last light of the day. The waitress was nice and friendly, although she was a little swamped. Once she took our order, the food came pretty fast. While we all had beer, I was actually the only one having fish and chips. My girlfriend had the veggie poutine (they have vegetarian gravy that is not bad) and our friend had a cheeseburger with fries and salad. We all enjoyed our food and I was pleasantly surprised by how calm this street is (compared to busy main streets like saint Denis or Mont-Royal where it's not as nice to sit out in the street). I was also glad for the opportunity to sit outside because sitting inside on the bar makes it harder to have a conversation when more than two people are involved, plus there is a lot of oil in the air near the kitchen.  We went to pay inside and discovered they only accept debit and cash :( but overall this is a good place to have a good time!",2
94,3,1547683200000,"Wow! I'm the first to review! How can that be? The Lotus Garden has been around for 60 years and there's no question as to why. The food is fantastic and the staff is very friendly and accomodating.

My meal always starts out with an egg roll. These are no ordinary egg rolls...they're not tiny, and aren't considered one of those side items tossed in as an afterthought as at most Chinese restaurants. No - these egg rolls could be a meal! Filled with baby shrimp, cabbage, and carrots, the filling is tender with a bit of a crunch. The wrapper isn't your typical thin, fried, ""papery skin"". The wrapper is a bit more substantial because of the size of the egg roll..yet it's crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside. The best egg rolls I've ever eaten.

I also like to order the fried pork dumplings. They're pretty basic as pork dumplings go, but they have a great flavor and the dipping sauce is very good. I'm pretty picky about my dumpling sauce. I don't like it too salty or too sweet. This is just perfect with a touch of heat.

My main course staple is the chicken with garlic sauce. This is noted on the menu as a spicy item. The Thai red pepper flakes give it the right amount of heat without overpowering the garlic brown sauce. It's a simple dish with slivers of white meat chicken, slivered water chestnuts, and a few mushrooms tossed in for good measure. This dish is so flavorful that you don't need anything else. I love the chicken paired with the crunch of the water chestnuts. They both take on the flavor of the sauce quite well. 

Other great dishes are the chicken lo mein, General Tso's Chicken, and chicken with broccoli.

Plus the atmosphere is welcoming and cozy. No need for takeout!",2

Had the brown bag chicken sandwich (good), and the fried okra (good). Also had the bacon cheeseburger and mac & cheese (both pretty good). Couples next to us ordered a sampler platter of some sort with shrimp - they both raved about it, as well as the custom style drinks.

$5 for a small(er) pitcher of good beers on Sundays - great deal. Lots of unique drinks, worth a try. Servers would awesome with recommendations and making their unique drinks.",2

I will only donate from this point forward when she's working. She knows me by name, happy, bright, sunny disposition, always has a loving presence and checks up on me throughout my 1-1/2 hour platelets donation process. Afterwards there are always lots of different juices in the frig, oatmeal raisin and chocolate chip cookies, Oreos, nuts and wheat thins.

Definitely try the fisherman's stew! It's sooo goooood. The corned beef and cabbage is amazing, the shepherd's pie is so savory and the bangers and mash are just wonderful.

The price for a haircut at this location is a little higher than I was paying in Marana. However, I still believe it is a good value due to the quality of the service.

147,3,1548115200000,"This place leaves a lot to desired. My dad and I went during the week because he was craving Mexican food. So, I suggested we give Gil's a shot - trying to support local restaurants. 

It was in a pretty dingy strip mall but we weren't deterred. There was a family eating on the patio so we decided to eat inside (and were the only ones in there, aside from one guy that stopped in to get a take-out order). 

We started with chips and salsa. The chips were descent - thicker than normal but tasty. The salsa (if you can call it that) was horrible. Not much better than tomato paste and a few spices. 

Then, we got a cheese crisp with green chiles. This was the highlight of the meal. Not a memorable cheese crisp but the green chiles were fresh and not canned. 

For entrees I got a shredded beef taco and my dad got a combo plate with an enchilada, rice and beans. Pretty bad - bland and nothing to come back for. 

The 1-star is for the friendly service, good chips and okay cheese crisp. But, if you're wanting Mexican food, you'd be better off at Valle Luna or Manuel's. 

And my rating is not because I'm comparing this place to normal ""Mexican food"" places - I know this place is supposed to be ""New Mexican."" I have been to good New Mexican food restaurants - this will never be one of them.",2

Now, I have had successful donations and I have had unsuccessful donations.  At one point I had to take a 16 week break.  Things happen.  But reality is what it is.  Sometimes it just doesn't work out for one reason or another.  Back in the day if you had a failed attempt in one arm followed immediately by a failed stick in the other, they'd apologize and send you on your way with a bandage on both arms and no donation.  No need to be upset about it.  It happens.  It is simply fortunate that I can donate.  Many can't but I cant see getting upset about it.  For whatever reason it just wasn't time NH.  Whether it was something in the questionaire or who knows. 

 I have yet, in all the time I have been going there ever felt unwelcomed or unwanted there.  Sorry you prepared so heavily and feel let down.  I can say the staff are all wonderful.  They are like a whole different family and the time spent in the chair is comfortable and safe!  I can honestly say I am defensive of them because I have spent many many hours in the chair.  Ms.Betty at the desk is definitely in her element!  Everyone there is upbeat and no one is ever grouchy!  Vinny is magic with a needle for those of you who worry about that.

Our server, Robert, made even the soup of the day (tomato bisque) sound out of this world. Even after the restaurant filled up, he was attentive and made sure we enjoyed our meal. 

We shared a handful of oysters with a mild jalapeño sauce. They could have been a bit briny-ier for my taste. And for entrees, we hit opposite ends of the taste spectrum: I had the pork carnitas, which was mild and sweet, with avocado, cole slaw, and a corn 'pancake,' with only a bit of red onion to balance it out. My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned. The bite I tasted was too hot (spice-wise, not temp) for me. 

The decor was comforting in a British pub style. I wish the menu had been more unique (burgers, BLT, variety of salads), esp for a place with the wird ""arrogant"" staring at you. 

I do plan on returning for dinner, to see what catches my eye.",1

I made the mistake of booking an appointment AND paying up front for a package before reading any of the reviews. The girl who sold me the package asked me what areas i would like lasered and i told her exactly what i wanted to be done (i have done numerous laser treatments in the past) so she told me that this package would be perfect for me. Later when i go in for my appointment they tell me that i have to pay extra for this body part and that body part! Not only did they sell me the wrong package but they refuse to refund me my money and want me to pay more that i initially anticipated. They never sent me a reciept (as the purchase was made over the phone) and the laser technician literally spent 10 minutes with me for full legs and bikini and face! They are in the business to scam individuals who are new to laser treatment and have no idea what to expect. All i can say is STAY AWAY",2

175,3,1547078400000,"Notes: 1 visit, late lunch.
Overall: Food had some good points, but I wasn't overwhelmed.  West Covina, CA location is better if you're in the area.

Hainan chicken - chicken was soft, but they left out the best part - the chicken juice.  I love it when they pour that stuff all over the rice.  (I say juice so it sounds healthier than say, 'oily chicken essence.'  Also, if you want really good Hainan chicken rice and you happen to be in Alhambra, CA, go here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/savoy-kitchen-alhambra#hrid:8nuOzJJQDsKa9NK-WhJsbQ/src:search/query:hainan%20chicken)  

Some sort of egg tofu - pretty good, but really heavy.  Don't order it unless you're hungry or you really know how to scarf protein.  

Roti canai - Must try for Malaysian cuisine it seems.  Crepe/pancake style bread that you dip in curry.  The curry was good, don't remember what kind it was.  I don't think it was served hot enough, though.  It got cold too quickly.  My mom said the bread wasn't as good as their location West Covina.  

Chicken satay - Really light appetizer.   They give you really small, thin strips of chicken.  Don't expect this to be in any way filling (unless you decide to pour the peanut sauce all over your rice, and you just might be because that sauce is so sweet and delicious.  Almost sweet enough to be a dessert.)",2
176,2,1547164800000,"I really want to give Sullivan's 4 stars but in comparing this experience to a recent visit to Longhorn, I just can't bring myself to do it.

Went here with a group from work for an ""appreciation dinner""  Normally, Appreciation dinners end up at Chili's or Ruby Tuesday so I was completely shocked we ended up here.

Everything was great service wise.  Foodwise, it was good but I'd expect that from a place like this.  I ordered one of their Mixup lunches which gives you a salad option, a protein and a side.  I ordered the mixed green salad, the porcini mushroom and pepper encrusted strip and an order of carmelized cauliflower as a side.

The strip was amazing.  It came sliced over a layer of steak sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  The salad was ok....mixed greens with tomatoes, blue cheese and a dressing that I still do not recognize.  The cauliflower came in a mound.  Honestly, this had to be 1/2 to 2/3 of the head of cauliflower.  It was seasoned with capers and other herbs.  While the taste was good, the quantity was entirely too much and I could only eat half.

The decor of the place is as you would expect with a lot of medium to dark wood but it just didn't do anything for me.  Same with the service. While they were all friendly, our water just didn't go beyond what he was expect to do.   

Sorry, Sullivans but I can get better service at Longhorn and frankly I think their food is better also.   But still this is a solid or 3 1/2 star review.",2

199,2,1546646400000,I met up with some friends here for some habachi and drinks. Let me start by saying that one usually doesn't associate Rock Hill will good Japanese food so I was initially skeptical but I'd figure I'd trust my friends and give it a try. Well I was happily surprised.  First of all the restaurant was very clean (which is VERY important for me) and we were greated warmly.  So we decided to have some drinks at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. I ordered a martini to start which was strong yet smooth followed by a shrimp tempura roll. The roll very pretty big and the shrimps tasted fresh. I especially like that it wasn't like most sushi rolls around here that are 90% rice and litte else. Once we were seated I ordered the steak and scallop hibachi.  This was my favorite by far! The steak was perfectly cooked and the scallops were especially tasty.  The best part was the portions were really good for the price and quality of the food. I had more than enough for lunch the next day!  It's definitely worth the drive and I'll totally keep going back.,2

We've dined here several times, and on Sunday, not surprisingly, we were the only non-Asian customers in the place. The chef was in rare form, and as I sit here having my third round of leftovers for lunch I'm still loving my dish. I opted for the Vinegar Fish, it's pretty simple -- whitefish, wood ear mushrooms and water chestnuts prepared with a dose of spice and rice wine vinegar. I'm guessing by the waitress' excitement when I ordered, that it's a dish they're pretty proud of. It was fabulous.

Hubby ordered the Beef and Onions, which I would classify as good, but not mind-blowing. We also partook of the Gai-choy which was cooked perfectly -- just the right amount of garlic and tenderness. 

In the past I've really loved their Mapo Doufu (tofu), theirs is one of the best I've had anywhere. Next time I'm planning on having the Water-Boiled Eel. I heart eel, mmm.

Service is pretty barebones, so don't expect to be sucked-up to. It's perfunctory and efficient, the food comes up fast and they leave you alone. I can't complain about that one bit.",2
206,3,1546387200000,"I love HIllcrest Dental! I will admit I haven't always treated my teeth well, and this has caused me to have a dentist phobia and thus made my teeth worse. Before I went here a few months ago, I didn't have a cleaning for close to 5 years! The hygienist was very gentle and took very long cleaning my teeth. I was surprised I didn't need a deep cleaning after so many years! She did mention my gums were receding a little, ( which I can clearly see) She told me to take a certain amount of vitamin C a day. Doesn't sound like a place that up sells to me. In the last month I have gone weekly, instead of silver fillings I now have beautiful white fillings that were very nicely done. Next up for me is a dental implant and invisalign in a few weeks when I save up enough :) take it from someone who hates her teeth and now is learning there is a way to be happy about her smile; this is the place to go! I feel like this place is one step ahead, tells me exactly what my options are, and now I feel completely comfortable going to the dentist after 25 years!

209,1,1548892800000,"I had wanted to try this tailor for some time and recently walked in with expensive jeans I needed hemmed.  I had read somewhere that the original hem could (or should) be retained so as not to spoil the ""look"".  When I mentioned this to the proprietor, he told me they could absolutely do this, but assured me they could reproduce the original hem for substantially less money.  They were able to do the work immediately, and the results were great.  The length was perfect and the new hem indistinguishable from the original.  

While I was waiting the five minutes for the job to be completed, another customer dropped in and had major alterations performed on a new suit - the results were impressive.  

The location is spacious and there is comfortable seating.  The price for my alteration was less than any other place I've frequented.   

On an earlier occasion, a friend and I took a well-worn leather jacket in for a repair estimate.  The tailor, who is obviously extremely talented, polite and personable, was honest about what could be accomplished and what the repairs would cost.

I once called and they answered ""Hold on"" and just put the phone down. After waiting a few minutes they just hung the phone up. I called back again and they answered ""Hold on"" again. I waited for 5 minutes before they took my order. I asked for their specials and the guy on the phone just says ""Well what do you want to know specials on?"" In a kind of sarcastic tone. We've ordered chicken tenders from here many times and were charged for them but received chicken wings instead. This has happened multiple times. When going back they did not even apologize and  they just took the wings back and made us wait for the chicken tenders to be made. Horrible customer service. The food here is WAY OVER PRICED. The pizza is mediocre. They may use ""fresh ingredients"" but really the crust is the best part of the pizza. Maybe I would have thought the food was better if I received better service.

254,1,1547942400000,"The best chain burger you can get in the city.
I first ate at this chain a few years ago on a road trip to Florida and as I was sitting in the car eating my cheeseburger wrapped in tinfoil (commenting that maybe we shouldn't have each ordered a fries because they're HUGE) I complained that we needed this in Toronto. Well now we do! Haha, and unfortunately for my waistline it's uncomfortably close to my house, and just as good as it was in the states. Not much was lost in the cross-border translation. From the bright red and white self-congratulatory decor, to the awesome food and the giant bins of peanuts that fill the room and sate your appetite as you wait for your food: everything has come North. 
The burgers are big (the standard burger is two patties) juicy and fresh. I like to keep the toppings simple (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, pickles), but there's pretty much anything you could want to put on them on the menu. The sesame seed bun does the job holding the messy burgers together and the processed cheese makes the burger creamy and adds just the right amount of flavour without taking away from the burger.
The fries are on par with the burger and as good as some chip truck fries:  big, fresh and crispy. And, as mentioned above, unless your incredibly hungry a regular fries can serve 2 easily and a large more. They actually measure out a heaping portion of fries and dump them in the bag loose to match the portion they give you in the container.
It's not cheap, you're looking at 25 dollars plus for two (share a fries and share a drink: there are free refills), but honestly it feels like you're easily getting your money's worth. No other burger chain comes close.",2
254,2,1546300800000,"So,if you are thinking of eating here but haven't gone to any one of the other acclaimed steakhouses in Las Vegas, I'd highly recommend you go elsewhere.  This place was a disappointment from beginning to end for us.

First thing you need to know is that if you look at the menu, the only place the word prime shows up is in the title.  The steaks are not prime.  And they definitely do not taste like prime steaks.  They may have prime steaks on the menu, but unless it specifically says it is, it ain't.  

Secondly, the service here sucks.  No sugar coating here.  I don't want people to make the same mistake I made and eat here when there is definitely much better in this town.  Go elsewhere for good service, or at least average service.

Well, hopefully I've dissuaded you.  If not, or if you just like reading about poor dinners like watching a car accident, read on.  

We ordered the crabcakes.  And this is where the problems started.  We dutifully split it in half as usual, I began eating and noted it was good, then I bit into a crab shell.  Wow, that hasn't happened to me at any decent restaurant and I've had my share of crabcakes.  Disappointed but willing to overlook this, I bit into another piece of shell.  I'm paying a pretty decent sum for a crabcake that isn't remarkable in any way, and I'm biting into shells?  Unbelievable.

Next up, the salads.  Except we didn't order salads.  They were for the table next to us.  With some horror I realized that our steaks and another table's salads were on the sam f-ing cart, but they served their salad first!  I don't think they do that kind of thing at a Black Angus, much less a restaurant that claims to be a top steakhouse.  Horrified but willing to ignore the two insults already suffered, we got our steaks and sides after a bit of a pause.  

My steak was ok.  18 oz bone-in ribeye.  The sauces weren't special but I'm not much of a sauce guy.  However, if you are going to pride yourself on your sauces, it should generate some interest from me.  Sides were decent.  Truffled mash potatoes were creamy, creamed spinach was what I expected.  I didn't much enjoy the bread though.  I got a pretzel roll that was extremely salty.  

And then the final insult.  We finished our steaks, and waited a long time for our waiter to come back, but we didn't see him again.  The second cleaned up and brought us out the dessert menu, but that took quite some time.  At this point I hadn't seen our waiter in so long I assumed he actually left.  I thought that was incredibly rude to do that without turning the table over to someone.  Why are we ordering dessert still?  I wanted to give this place a chance to right the wrongs.  After ordering the crepe suzette (17 layers!), we waited a long time for our dessert.  A real long time.  And after finishing what I thought was a good dessert, we waited a long time for our check.  At this point our waiter returned!  We hadn't seen him since we ordered.  Apparently he had been taking care of another table.  He didn't tell us this, which would have alleviated a lot of the insult I felt by this time.  He cleared our dessert and we wanted no more of this restaurant.  It took a full 15 minutes for him to bring us our checks.  By this point we were angry.  We got here at about 6:45, and it was now 9:15.  So we spent an equal amount of time being seated, ordering and eating as we did waiting on our dessert and paying our check.  I won't be back here when there is so much better in town.",2

I got my nails painted with the gel nail paint, which is amazing in that it lasts over two weeks everytime I get it done. It was $25, as well as, I always leave a $5 tip, unless the service was just ridiculously horrible, which hasn't happened to me yet, thank goodness. The man who did my nails and I won't leave his name. Well, he seemed depressed, like he'd rather be somewhere else. At one point, he went back to get him a bottle of water, did not ask if I would have liked one and sat it down right in front of me and frankly, I would have accepted one, I was thirsty. He did attempt some small talk, but I could tell, he really didn't want too. I also attempted small talk, just to make the time go by faster, plus I do try to be polite whereever I am, Its just my nature. I'm from the south. Also, he was dressed rather shabbily, just not professional in my opinion. He did get some of the clear coat on my skin above my nail, which has taken several hand washings to get off.

However, the assistant manager who was helping us was completely incompetent. She did not know pricing or what was available for our time frame.

273,2,1547424000000,"I visited this restaurant last time in 2015 and gave low rating then. Two days ago while we stayed at Caesars Palace, my friend insisted to have some to-go order of Chinese food within the hotel despite my objection. So, we went.

We ordered a BBQ Platter ($29.99), a Pork Ribs in Sweet Vinegar Sauce ($19.99), and one order of custard bun - Egg Yolk Quicksand as they called it ($6.99). In total, we paid over $60 for these three items. 

I was astonished to see the BBB Platter when we got back to the room and opened the box. This platter was about half the size of the same dish I ordered once there two years ago. In the combination platter, there were three kinds of meat - 4 very small pieces of Poached chicken, 4 very small pieces of Roast Duck and BBB Pork. I almost couldn't believe they were serving so few pieces of so tiny size at such quite high price. As to the BBB Pork, it was chopped (not slicked) into pieces about 5 times thicker than normal sliced BBQ Pork served at most other restaurants. Their poor and tacky knife cut made the BBQ Pork look as dull as a portion of pig's frozen dead body, totally unappetizing and iffy. I was wondering how they could charge $30 for a small box of food with quality level lower than that of a food court vendor. 

I must give a low rating to this restaurant again. I am a Chinese and I know how good Chinese food should look and should be prepared. They still don't think they should upgrade, instead they shrink the portion and size of the food and raise the prices with no business ethics at all. Doesn't Caesars Palace feel ashamed to allow such a low-end place sitting there to fool and rip off non-Chinese tourists and suckers?

After this bad experience, I checked again their recent ratings on Yelp and found they've got more and more poor ratings. They deserve for what they are doing, and I believe if they continue doing so, they won't stay there too long.",2

The slices were large and thin, so one pizza was enough to make two people full at three slices per person. The pizza was thin crust, but still had a slight chew to go with the crunch which I enjoyed. The North Beach had smoked mozzarella and clams on it, and was described as bbq chicken pizza with the chicken swapped for clams. It was unique with tender clam pieces, but I think they planted a dangerous seed since I found myself wishing it had a dash of bbq sauce!

Guess they knew security wasnt going to be around. ..during the whole 5 hour experience we saw security just once escorting someone out and medics walked by twice. Good time good venue!,2
307,2,1548720000000,"I don't know if this is the correct PODS location, but this comment is about the entire PODS company, not a specific location.

The whole notion of loading all your belongings into a box and then having the box shipped to the city you're moving to is brilliant and simple...unless you're dealing with PODS. These folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. My brother moved to Scottsdale from Minneapolis. He arrived well ahead of his PODS container. However, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. When he called them he was told, ""Oh yeah. The container arrived last week."" It never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.
Next was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. Problem is, no one at PODS location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. All they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they're so busy. Since when are the internal logistics problems at PODS any concern of the client? Thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. Of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.
And then there's the challenge of trying to contact PODS. All communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it's a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. So, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! You get to deal with a call center lackey.
My brother did give a positive shout-out to the guys PODS sent out to empty out his home in Minneapolis and load the container. They damaged only two pieces of furniture and they didn't break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.
Bottom line here is that until PODS matures and figures out its logistics issues, timing issues, and customer service issues, you'll do much better with U-Haul or Atlas Van Lines.",1
312,1,1547510400000,"Please thank your head server for telling us to sit far away at a table far away from everyone because according to her our 2yo twin boys are loud. We had just walked in for 20 seconds! 
Her actions made it possible to have an excellent dinner at Bachi Burger. 

We have been there three previous times with the worst sounds made being the little soy sauce dishes being tossed on the floor. 
We were seated at the last table in the restaurant closest to the restrooms at the time. The same person sat us that time as well. She is a shorter Asian woman with glasses. 
Our boys are not children who cry throughout dinner, in fact they do not cry at all when they are out eating. Because they love food!
They are the type who flirt with the other very friendly tall server and wave at the man who brought our iced teas. 
You lost repeat customers who will take every chance that we get to make sure everyone knows what kind of a person you choose to employ.

316,2,1548201600000,"Located out in the sticks, you'll find an apple-fetishist's utopia, The Apple Factory!

I've been familiar with this place since I was a kid, and used to LOVE taking the drive over there. The place is just so laid back, with the giant apple-shaped apple stand on the side of the building, which used to sell candy apples and apple cider, though I haven't seen it open in some time. Maybe I've just been arriving at the wrong time? There's also currently a petting zoo on the other side of the building, with a coin-operated machine that dispenses feed for the animals. 

Inside is your typical tiny grocery store/butcher. They do sell many specialty items that you may not find at a regular grocery store, along with pretty much anything Apple that you can think of. But all of that is foreplay to the main attraction: THE PIES. They have their own little pie patrol that bakes the freshest, most delicious homemade pies, I don't think I've ever bought one that wasn't 100% fresh and amazing. 
I've never really been a pie-guy, but this place is different. And if you don't want an entire pie, they also sell slices. Their strawberry rhubarb is amazing. I've never Jason Biggs'd a pie before, but the s.r. has definitely gotten a couple of suggestive glances from me.

As for the service, the employees are always very sweet, helpful, and have been known to give out free apple cider at times.

I also can't complete this review without mentioning the Apple band. That's right, a Chuck-E-Cheese-esque Apple band is occasionally available to play on their mini-stage...you just have to catch them at the right time. Those apple rock stars can be pretty big divas.",2

332,2,1547856000000,"Kitchen items/appetizers now limited to 3 orders per person. It used to be unlimited, along with all the thinly sliced beef, pork, and sliced chicken, seafood (including crab legs and shrimp), veggies that you can DIY cook in the hot pot at your table.  But for what you are getting and what they are charging, it is still a good value proposition. Come on, for $20 a person without the hassle of getting all the ingredients yourself and the cleaning up afterwards, totally worth it! 

I first came to Shabu Grill all the way to this section of LV because of an UYE hosted by Debbie N.  The event was a resounding success, and we pretty much got to try as much of their menu as we were able to stuff down our faces.

So when a guys night out event was recently organized at this very same location, it was a no brainer for me.  The food is still very good, the service was just as attentive, and the experience just as positive.  The restaurant even accommodated us with extra portable hot pot setups, so 2 instead of 4 or 5 people shared each hot pot.  It just worked out better for us.

The main reason I like this place is the fact that everything for the shabu shabu portion of the dining experience is DIY, including getting the ingredients from the refrigerated cooler nearby.  I love the fact that I can get as little or as much of something, instead of being forced to finished big plates of one item before I can order more or something else.  

The DIY sauce and condiments bar is pretty cool.  Not as extensive as comparable restaurants in SoCal, but you get to customize your dipping sauces as wonderfully or not so fantastically as your creativity and inner toque wearing chef would allow.  But it is pretty hard to score a TOTAL FAIL in this minor endeavor, so relax and just have a go at it.  The important thing is to have fun and enjoy this interactive meal solo, but preferably with a small group of friends.

I would totally go back, especially when the weather is still very nippy in the evening.

Note:  There is a ""bar"" in the front when you walk in, but they do NOT serve alcohol at this establishment.  But if you have room for some beer or other adult beverages, there is a PT in the same strip mall.

337,3,1547424000000,"This business is amazing. I was almost finished painting my bedroom when I spilled the remaining pint on my carpet. We called and Sandy answered- immediately told us what to do with the situation and said found us a technician to come out within an hour and a half. She was so sweet and helpful especially when we were freaking out a little bit. The technician gave me tips on keeping the carpet cleaned and got all of the paint out. He was prompt, professional and I wish I had cash so that I could have tipped him! Highly recommend this business, and will be using them from here on out for their services.",2

344,2,1547683200000,The staff here are so friendly and happy it's impossible to leave in a bad mood. Huge portions of a variety of vegetables for a cheap price. Everything on the menu is delicious! By far the best vegetarian joint in the city.,2

349,3,1546300800000,"This is why I am giving this place 5 stars. Let me start from the beginning. I was invited to a wedding for November 26. I planned my whole trip from Denver, Colorado the whole month. I bought an expensive dress and made sure I had everything I needed for that special day. On November 25th I don't know what the heck happened but my neck Popped! 

Yeah my next popped and I could not move my neck! I swear I cried all day because I was in pain. I stayed home thinking by the next day I would feel better. Nope. I was worse. So I looked up for a chiropractor. Keep in mind I also don't have health insurance because that is expensive as hell. 

I find this place and it has 5 stars. I call and this amazing nice lady answered the phone. I forgot her name unfortunately but she was so sweet. She told me to go in and the doctor would see me. 

I go in and immediately they start working on me. I apparently tore a muscle and that is why I was in pain and could not move my head! I was scared and I talked to Dr. Brandon Wentzel about the wedding I was going to be attending at 6 that day. He promised to make me better and that I would be able to move. 

Guess what? He did! I left the doctor place able to move and even though I still had pain it lowered from a 10 to 1! 

SO happy to have been able to go here and have two people take care of me and make me better. Thank you so much. 

Plus it was not pricey and did not cost me an arm and a leg!

Thank you so much!",2
354,1,1548806400000,"I just moved to the area and ran into this restaurant. They staff was super friendly and took their time to explain the varied menu selection. The food was delicious and on top of everything, the place was super clean. I will definitely be coming back!",2
361,2,1546732800000,"I've been here a number of times now and have been satisfied every time. I always get a custom salad, and they have pretty good choices for regular and premium add-ons. I usually get the spinach with black beans, red onion, red pepper, and mushrooms. I add avocado, and just get their house vinaigrette. It's nothing special, but the ingredients have always been (and tasted) fresh and crisp. They also give a very generous portion of avocado, which I really enjoy. It's nice to have this option around campus. Sure, there are some great restaurants around, but as far as fast food goes, nothing else very healthy is nearby. I'll be going back.",3
369,2,1547510400000,I heard about this place from shark tank so I obviously had to go check out. It was everything I expected and more. The presentation was not only adorable but the tea was amazing. I'm a full on coffee addict and I told my boyfriend I would drink this tea over coffee any day! Tastes just like how I would drink my tea while I was in London. Definitely telling all my friends about this place and next time I'm in need of any custom cakes or pastries I'll be ordering from here as well. Thank you guys!,2
372,3,1547856000000,Cooked to perfection. I mean perfection. Red mashed potatoes were puréed. Bacon wrapped shrimp were beyond flavorful. Peppercorn steak spot on.

They know their product and enjoy discussing comics, toys and anime with anyone and everyone. Their selection of current comics is unbeatable, although they really could use more back issues. When the death of Captain America issue came out, they sold out pretty much immediately. Because the owner knew my boyfriend was a fan and a regular, he saved an issue just for him. Ya can't ask better service than that!",2

399,3,1546992000000,Never have had a problem using Al Phillips.  The staff is friendly and they get the job done quickly.  Not to mention that they are very affordable.  I always use them for my dry cleaning needs.,2
400,2,1547769600000,"First of all, this is a budget hotel currently under renovation.  Therefore all the mediocre reviews below should take into account that this property is in transition.  I first stayed here back in the 80's and gradually watched it deteriorate.  So its current condition is great in comparison.   The rooms no longer look like photos 11 and 12 posted above. The rest are up to date.

* Positives:  Flat screen TV's on wood laminate TV walls, furniture has been updated since the photos posted, IKEA lighting, temperature controls in each room (but older units), very clean and loved the wood flooring over nasty hotel carpeting.  The current internet rate is $72/night.  How can you beat that in a central Toronto location? I like that you need to use your room key to move the elevator. This stops strangers from accessing the upper floors as the desk can't see the elevators.  There is a security guard on at night.  A concierge will also be located in the lobby in the future. 

* Negatives:  The awful drapery and the bathroom still needs some improvement.  The room is small but no different than any other budget hotel.  The lobby and restaurant are being renovated so you have to deal with that.  Paying $10 a day for wireless is a bit too much.

I would stay here again.  Another plus, the Airport Express bus stops right at the door taking you to Pearson aiport for $20 (or $18 online).",2

412,3,1546560000000,"I have been going to this restaurant on and off since we moved into the Richmond Hill area 16 years ago. Tonight on our way back from the hospital and being Labour Day we thought we would call them to see if they were open. So I got Siri going and got the number. I dialed it and asked if they were open. The lady on the phone said that they were very busy and that I should make a reservation. I did and off we went. When we got there the first clue that something was amiss was that the place was nearly deserted and they could not find my reservation. We took our seat and proceeded to order. Not five minutes into this and we get a call from a local number, it was the first restaurant we called wondering where we were. As it turns out the owners of Cynthia's created a tangent restaurant called Cynthia's Paradise and put it literally right next door. Talk about confusing your market. Given the way the night was going to unfurl we should have packed up and gone next door.

I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup to start. This is one of my favourites and when I looked at the $4.95 price tag I assumed we were going to get a bowl big enough to share. When it came I got this little golden globe before me which revealed inside an even smaller ceramic bowl which if it held 1 cup of soup I would have been amazed. The soup was adequate. It has a nice balance of all the flavours I am used to but in no way was this worth 5 dollars. I mean for just one dollar more at another chinese restaurant I got a bowl of soup so large that it would have filled that little bowl before me 20 times over. What really drove the point home though was the little tiny $3.50 Egg Roll and the 2 HarGow for $4.50. This place was way over priced. So maybe the service was going to be exceptional. I mean, there were more people on the floor, behind the counter and that could be seen in the kitchen than there were patrons sitting at the tables. The 2 HarGow came one at a time in the tiniest steam boxes I have ever seen. We ordered Moo Shu Pork, Chinese Broccoli and the House Special Fried Rice. The food took way longer to get to us than was comfortable for me but taste wise it was very good. Far too expensive but very good. Ended the meal with the Deep Fried Creme Brulee and with a 13% tip the meal came out to $94.75.

Frankly I can think of a number of places that I would like to spend that kind of money for 2 people. Cynthia's Chinese Restaurant is no longer one of those. As a comparison the meal at Cynthia's Paradise would have cost $54 for two people all you can eat. I will do a review of Paradise when I go there but this place will never see another dime from me.",2
413,1,1548115200000,I really hate giving bad reviews for small businesses but I wish I went to Harvey's :(  the people Are very friendly but they forgot my coleslaw and my gravy.

Here's a tip if you want your sandwich quicker. Have a drink at the 32 bar right next door and order your food from there. It took less than ten minutes for our sandwiches to get to us after we ordered them. That's fast considering the line for this place is always super long.",2

445,2,1546560000000,"Dropped in on a Saturday night....thankfully prior to the rush beginning. 
We found a seat immediately and our server was over shortly thereafter, told us the wing/beer special, took our drink order and off she went.
When she returned, we ordered our dinner and some appetizers. Appetizers were Mac and cheese triangles...absolutely the greasiest, worst tasting item I've ever put in my mouth at a restaurant. Potato skins were very dry...no flavour at all.
Some of us ordered the wing dinner, which was wings, fries and a soft drink (no refills). The fries came out as an appetizer...not with the wings. They were basic fries and pretty flavourless.
When our food came out, it came out at different times. 2 people got their order (one was a wing dinner and the other a burger dinner) while a 3rd was returned because the person who brought out the wings could not tell us which type of wings they were. She said she would be right back with them, but she answered a phone and talked on it for an awfully long time. 10 minutes later, those wings were brought back out, with the other 3 wing orders. WTF?
Wings were a huge disappointment. While meaty, they were sprinkled with minimal sauce....no  flavour at all. We would have sent them back but we never saw our waitress until 20 minutes later....she was serving other tables, on the phone, settling bills, etc. 
We will not go back",3

I would say body shop work is one of those things in life that last as long as you own your vehicle. To put it into perspective, from the time you get your car back after the repairs are done from an accident, and until you either sell or trade in your car, you'll know with certainty if the work was not done right.

If the repairs were performed at USA Collision, I know with certainty that I will never know from looking at the vehicle, that, it was in a collision.

452,2,1547856000000,"I was incorrectly billed $11.52 for fuel charges.  When I called to dispute the error, I spoke with Lian Santon.  At first she told me the charge was because the company undercharged me for the vehicle.  When I explained that I made the purchase through hotwire, she then switched the reason for the charge to me upgrading my vehicle at the counter, which was incorrect.  After being placed on hold for a while, she told me the fee was for fuel, yet I brought the vehicle back on full.  After being placed on hold for over 30 min, she told me that they would only be able to credit back $8 and not the full $11.52 because the other $3.52 was included in taxes.  Another representative called back to tell me that the company would have to call the car rental location and verify that the car was brought back on full before I could receive the other $3.52.  This is pointless to me because if an associate entered a fuel charge in error and the transaction happened weeks ago, it would be difficult to remember this particular transaction given the large volume of rental returns that have taken place since then.",2

459,3,1547424000000,"They treat patients like an ATM. 

I cracked a tooth. EXTREME pain right now. Got a Saturday ( today visit). I told the front desk BEFORE I went back that I didn't get paid until Wednesday ( a few days), and that I just paid to fix my roof so money is tight. After being examined and X rayed they explained what they could do and that my portion would be $160. They weren't sure they could even help m today as Phan's schedule was tight. I told them I could only pay $100 today. I was told by their office manager they don't do payment plans , they could try and get me some dental credit plan. I told them I didn't want to do that. It was $160 today or nothing. I told them I was unable to do that. So I came in pain , left in pain- they did nothing for me - I offered to pay my bill (around $60) as I left. They wanted to bill my insurance etc but I didn't want to hear from them again so I insisted I pay it all now because I wanted nothing to do with them ( contact me after insurance etc). . I complained  and to shut me up they wiped the bill clean. 

They are all about the money. My $100 today plus insurance ( and $60 in 3 business days) wasn't enough to help me. Forget about helping me because I was in pain - they did nothing - nothing - they wouldn't even do it for 2/3 my portion today , the rest in a few days ( as well as gouging my  insurance) 

THEY ARE ALL ABOUT THE MONEY. They don't care if you hurt. They are very high tech - and I understand they need to pay off all their high tech equipment - 

My opinion : Pham sucks! Palo verde dental sucks!  

Came in pain , left in pain - they use your pain to extort money from you. It's just white collar crime - they knew exactly my finances before I even went to a room , and then after exam it was ""pay up or get out"" - the officer manager specifically said ""we do not do payment plans"". 

They wasted my one day off when I could have found someone who would help me when I am in severe pain

 We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation time, and we were still seated immediately.  I loved how the servers was very attentive and chatty.

 The complimentary bread basket was very good.  I loved how there was different selections (jalapeno bread, cornbread, walnut bread).  For an appetizer, we decided to try the chicken quesadilla, and it was really good.  I would highly recommend it.  

 We decided to order the 22 ounce Chipotle Rib Eye Steak for our entree.  The steak was huge and can definitely feed 2 people.  The steak was cooked pretty well.  I loved dipping the steak in the sauce.

When I got to the place, I was a little skeptical as there werent any customers. The place looked cozy and comfortable though! Got the food and brought it home. Had a taste and we were extremely impressed. This is a true definition of ""You can't judge a book by it's cover"". The food tasted fresh and homemade. I was so relieved that I didn't see a lot of steam when I opened the box, as that usually means the food was microwaved. 

I will say though, the online menu prices are outdated. The actual prices are a little more expensive (at least for the lasagna).

Can't wait to try this place again.",2

Reasonable prices, delicious food, chill atmosphere and friendly employees. Cannot wait to go back!",1
499,1,1546387200000,"Okay, we all know this restaurant is a love child of the most celebrated chef in America, Thomas Keller.  It is expensive, but not more expensive than the other upscale restaurants in the Palazzo/Venetian complex.  We also know this is Mr. Keller's ""bistro"" play, it has been much documented.  And I love French bistro food, my favorite kind on earth.  So 2 stars?  Here's why:

Service: At these prices you expect excellent service.  We had two tables of 8 each, next to each other, and all I can say is that the service was no better than what you would hope to receive at a Chili's.  Timing was off, smiles were rare, it took forever to deliver a glass of cranberry juice to the one person not drinking wine.  Clean-up was either too early or too late.  Just a mess.  Unacceptable at a restaurant of this rep.

Food:  Yes, pommes frites are a staple of bistros, and Bouchon is known for theirs, but the volume of fries was overwhelming.  At the end of the meal we all sat looking around and laughing at the endless piles of frites that nobody could finish.  I had a flatiron steak, asked for it medium rare, it arrived well done.  I could have sent it back, but given the service I didn't want to chance it, so chewed (and chewed and chewed) it down.  Steak quality was mediocre.  Had a endive/watercress salad that truly was nothing special.  The walnut vinaigrette did nothing to enhance the bitter endive, think it made it worse.  Ostensibly there was some Roquefort cheese in the salad, but about 4 little nibbles, added nothing to the rest of the salad - disintegrated.  I know times are tight, but this is a double digit priced salad, c'mon.  Nobody raved about their entree, in fact, I think people were expecting something special and kind of stared at what was delivered.

Wine:  A pretty fair list, and while not reasonably priced, I've seen more outrageous pricing elsewhere.  But it was predictable, mainly French, with a nice representation from the major regions, but nothing unique or intriguing.  Very safe list.  If this is a bistro there should be some more fun, and less pricey, bistro-y choices like Cru Bourgeois from Bordeaux, a longer list of Provencal wines, some unique choices from Cali.  I could have put this list together in my sleep, and the sommelier and wine service was pretty sleepy and sloppy as well.

I've been here for breakfast/brunch, and I guess this is their speciality, it was super, a 4 or maybe 5 star breakfast, love that.  But for dinner?  A disappointment.  This restaurant needs an overhaul.",2
506,1,1548547200000,"First time I came here, it was pretty empty. Not that it's a bad thing, the food actually came out better. Then today, I came again. Except it was busier. The food- (BBQ Beef) came out oily and kind of gross. They also mixed up my father's order and gave it to someone else. If you come when the restraint is empty, you get better food and service.",2
517,3,1548547200000,My drink was delicious! I had an iced sweetheart mocha. I also had a sandwich. Really tasty!  Best of all. The nicest people! I will continue to go there!,2
530,2,1546819200000,"Retro thrift store aesthetic meets indie backroom music show stage meets alt food scene, all wrapped up in a resto-café. I've been here just a few times and it gets just above a 'meh' rating from me. None of the food I've had here is remarkable in any sense, though I do like very much that it's a health-conscious menu. To qualify, I haven't had a full meal: just lattés, tacos and treats. I tried an iced tea, which was watered down so as to not have much flavour at all, but my friend liked it fine. She drank my iced tea and bought me a chai latté instead, which was honestly still just... meh. My date square treat was also nothing special, taste-wise. However, I will report that my friend's goat cheese sammie was very tasty according to her. So, seems it's a bit hit and miss. 
The music is LOUD. 
The seating is eclectic but comfortable enough, and you're definitely welcome to hang out with your laptop for all eternity. 
Ultimately, it wouldn't be my first pick for places to meet and chow down, but I did catch a really fantastic music show there one night, so I'd go back for another sometime.",2

It is comparable with Sardine's happy hour for their oysters, but Tempest has much more to offer than just oysters. I would recommend trying all of their food offers. They are each delightful in their own way. The atmosphere is lovely- simple, elegant, transports you to a warmer climate with their ocean-esque decor. This is truly a hidden gem in Madison.",2

538,1,1546732800000,"Had a date night with the wife recently and decided to try Momocho from a recommendation of a friend.

I saw all the reviews and decided to go with the Guacamole sampler.   We got an original, crab, and pineapple habanero as our choices.  Original was just regular old plain guac.  I wouldn't get that again.  Not with so many different choices to choose from.  Next, the crab didn't do it for me.  My wife liked it, though.  So if you don't like seafood in your guac like me skip the seafood options.  My favorite was the pinapple habanero.  Simply outstanding.  Next time I may opt for just 1 guac and some salsas.

My wife ordered the pork carnitas and I had the hanger steak.  Both meals were completely cooked to perfection and was more than enough food for dinner.  Heck, the guac was more than enough.

I ordered coffee and jalapeno bread pudding for dessert.  Coffee made with cinnamon and brown sugar?  Was amazing.  The bread pudding had the jalapeno taste without the bite.  Was also to do for.  I highly recommend it.

They tell you when you make the reservation that your experience will last about 2 hours.  That was spot on.  We didn't feel rushed.  Nor did we feel it was too slow.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will easily go back.  The best part was I didn't spend as much as I thought I would.  So its very reasonable.",3

We had a reservation so when we got there, it just took a few minutes, then we were seated.  I got the spicy sausage and vegetable soup, it was really good, nice and spicy!  My husband ordered the meat and cheese plate, it was fine, just average.  I'm sure if you were to custom order this, would be much better.  The entrees that we ordered were the Jambalaya and the Short Rib Stew.  The Jambalaya was a huge portion and quite tasty, spicy, smokey, delish.  We were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of Phoenix Magazine, kind of disappointing.  It seemed a bit bland, it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread, would not have completed the dish.  For dessert, we both had the salted caramel pudding, best dessert I have had in a long time.  I don't think I have enough descriptive words in my vocabulary to explain this....just salted enough, creamy, decadence, perfection.  

All in all, a really nice meal!",2

The facility itself is so fresh and so clean... My young daughter can run around barefoot and not walk away with black soles on her feet or grime on her hands, and it's the only children's facility I've been where they use only organic, natural products to clean their equipment (and it doesn't smell hippy dippy).

 In addition to a safe, clean place to play, the program is FANTASTIC. The teachers, Jeremy and Ben, pack so much into an hour...! It's definitely not a free-play sort of place (you should expect to do everything with your child if they're under 3), but I wouldn't *want* it to be; we love singing and dancing together at circle time, trying out the different tumbling skills, and climbing together on equipment together.

None of the techs even appeared close to being done with their current clients, and no one had ever told me they'd be with me soon. I decided to leave and as I gathered my things, a tech asked me if I was leaving. She told me she was going to do a manicure, then me next. I told her I couldn't wait that long, that my water was cold, I'd been sitting there a half hour. I told her it's ok to say they don't have time, or just have me wait up front, but they shouldn't have sat me in a pedi station with my feet in water waiting for that long. I won't be back.",2

The ambiance is almost like a trashier version of johnny rockets with the red bar stools, simple American Food with burgers, shakes, fries, chili cheese dribbled onto everything. Although it seems they are making an attempt to be a little healthier with their new crispy chicken wrap (tortilla wrapped fried chicken with all the burger fixings on the inside). I mean the menu is by no means healthy. It is called FATburger- due to the quantity of food and the calories associated with that food. But as I watched them make our burger, I noticed they were not premade patties and they were using what seemed like ""not previously frozen- but who knows"" ground beef. Also it didn't seem like they were using binders (egg or breadcrumbs) 
As we ate our burger noticed the burger was kinda dry, probably due to the amount of add ons and very little mayo. Def had to ask for extra Mayo.

We're addicted to pho hence our regular check-ins here! This is one of our favorite spots in town. Pho Tai Nam is my go-to dish to order. The secret is in the broth and it is delicious.

After hearing the rumors and reviews of being one of the top steak houses, i came out to try this aged steak. It was beautifully refrigerated on display outside the stop. Just by looking at it, I started to salivate. I must say the steak lived up to my expectation, the picture cannot do it justice. The tenderness of the meat was perfect with being too overcooked. Getting medium-rare sab f meat had its own unique taste which complimented the seasoning really well. Each bit was like getting a massage on my palate by the juice that sprayed out. It was quite MOOving if I may say. The lamb rack was less spectacular as it was just average with a bit of tenderness in the middle but the outsides were a bit hard, probably because it was ordered as medium (who even does that).

I think at one point, I was playing catch up with all the cuts of meat I had waiting for me on my plate. All of us couldn't help being a little extra gluttonous. 

And who can say no to their pineapple? 
The second time they came around with the pineapple, to my group of 6, and we were told there were only 3 pieces left at the moment... Every man for himself! Needless to say, I wanted them all..

Service was meh. We initially had reservations made for 9, and didn't actually get seated until almost 9:30. 
It wasn't even a case where they were full and couldn't accommodate - there were multiple empty tables (that seated 6). Yet, we were told to wait, as the server continued to seat others who came after us with later reservations of 9:30. 
It wasn't until we had to press them for our reservation a 3rd time, where we finally got seated - in the corner of the restaurant beside the bar. Not impressed. Not to mention there were still empty tables in the main dining. 

Quality-wise for the food was much better, in comparison to their Adelaide location. Salad bar/antipasto at this location was much smaller and bleak, but the mussels are worth mentioning.

686,1,1548288000000,"MTO Cafe: Made To Order.
This is a nice, new, cheery spot located across the street from City Hall, on the first floor of the parking garage right there. A friend and I met for a meal on a recent Friday at 11:00am and were seated right away. The menu offers up breakfast and lunch items, many of them comfort food style: chicken n waffles, grilled cheese sandwiches, as well as a Fat Elvis sandwich (French toast, Nutella, bacon, peanut butter, and strawberries).  The 'made to order' part applies to the breakfast, where you can choose a wrap, omelet, or skillet form for options that include avocado, salmon, chicken, chili, and broccoli.
I had the MTO breakfast:  3 eggs, chicken sausage, 2 slices of turkey bacon, 2 slices of regular bacon, 2 slices of Spam, mash browns, and toast.  Opting for egg whites and sourdough toast, it was a larger than normal meal for me with all of that meat.  The bacon was made just right, but the Spam wasn't cooked long enough and the turkey bacon was buried underneath the eggs and just limp. The chicken sausage was good, too.  The mash browns are a combo of mashed potatoes and hash browns and I enjoyed those very much.  I left one slice of Spam and half a slice of chicken sausage on my plate, full from all that food.  
I used my Yelp check-in offer of free Walnut Tossies when we got there.  Our server had never seen it before so she took my phone over to another waitress who cleared it with her boss.  Said boss, Ben, came over to our table and introduced himself as one of the owners.  Apparently I was the first person to use the check-in so he asked how it worked on the phone app, I showed him, and he was very happy.  I was happy with the Walnut Tossies at the end of the meal for dessert, 3 little mini-pastries of walnut and brown sugar.  
Overall, it was a good experience, especially since my friend treated me to this meal.  I don't spend $14 on breakfast on a normal basis, but I'll come back to try some of the lunch items.  MTO Cafe is a cool addition to Downtown and nice to have as a dining option there.",2

This is after we've paid them. So I asked for a refund, and they said they wouldn't refund me because there wasn't 24 hours notice!!! Meanwhile, the hotel manager was being flippant and accused me of lying that I'd called in the first place. He claimed that they had no female receptions on their staff!!! When expedia called to get a refund, a female manager answered the phone and said that they had no male managers on their staff!!! Unbelievable! I fully intend to pursue legal action against this hotel if this matter is not resolved soon.",2
704,1,1548633600000,"My wife and I stayed at the Plaza over Labor Day weekend. This was our second visit since their remodel. We were a little apprehensive given some of the bad reviews I read prior to this visit so we actually booked a comped room at the Orleans as back up. We chose to pay for the Plaza because we prefer to stay downtown. I am happy to say we didn't need to use our back up room and stayed all three nights at the Plaza.

Check was a breeze even though we were there at 1pm, they had 5 people working so the line moved very quickly and since I had picked up a $2 Coors before getting in line I was fine with the wait. Robert at check in was very pleasant and since I explained my apprehension to him he worked very hard to make sure we had a good room. He really wanted to make sure we had a good floor but couldn't get us a King bed on the floor he wanted for us so I took the two queens which isn't a real big deal. I couldn't be happier with his service.

We were given a very nice room in the south tower on the 21st floor with a nice view of the strip. The room was as we remembered from our last visit. The furnishings are nice and in good shape. the bed's were comfortable but the pillows were a little lacking. The room was clean and believe me we checked thoroughly before unpacking. The room is good size for Downtown. The only things I would have liked the room to have would be a coffee maker (we brought our own instead) and a refrigerator (which is rare downtown except at the Main street Station). The floor we were on was quite and didn't smell of smoke. In fact I think in the three nights there I only saw one other person on the floor. Maid service was always prompt and thorough. She even left a couple extra waters for us each day (probably due to a nice tip every morning).

The Casino at the Plaza is ok. We played some slot machines and the electronic crap machine a lot. Drink service was good. We mainly play Blackjack though and I don't care to much for the tables there. We prefer the double deck 3/2 at the Cal. We did play one evening with some of the Girls around the dancing stage. Even though they pay 6/5 and use auto shufflers, which I hate, the girls were actually very funny and we had a good time. We did play at the craps table a few times and the dealers were all very nice and friendly.

We saw a couple of comedians at the comedy club one night. The tickets were a little overpriced for the show, even with the 2 for 1 coupon, but we had fun and didn't feel to bad about doing it. The drinks at Z bar while we waited for the show to start were great.

Island Sushi is a nice little place, prices are great and the food was very good. the fish tasted fresh and clean. The sizes were a little small but given the price I cant complain to much we just ordered more. 

Pop up Pizza is amazing especially at 1 or 2 am after drinking vodka and playing cards all night. 

The Mexican place in the food court has a great breakfast burrito.

All in all a nice trip especially since I am a rate watcher and got all three nights over the weekend with resort fee for $128 total. 

The Plaza is perfect for downtown stays. Right there for all the action but not so in the middle of it that it is crazy and loud like the D. It was nice to walk thru all of the noise and madness of Freemont on a Saturday night to come back to the Plaza and leave all of that on the other side of the street. We will be back for sure.",2
704,2,1548806400000,"Super please with our new gate. Everyone we dealt with was prompt, professional, and on time - all qualities that seem to be all too rare when working with local trades.

We gave them a design for a quote. They gave us a ball park price, later came and measured once to confirm price, and a second time when we made the purchase.

Two weeks later our new iron courtyard gate was installed. It matched the picture perfectly. The installers even came back a second day to touch up some concrete that had chipped and everything looks amazing.

We got four other quotes - 1 was a horrendous experience, 1 no showed, and all were at least $400 more with a 4 - 6 week wait.",2
704,3,1546732800000,"There is nothing extra about Sushi Xtra. Infact, its easily classifiable as your average run of the mill sushi place with many variants of dynamite, dragon and spider rolls.  I ordered the most exciting thing on the menu: a fire dragon roll with hamachi. Sounded sooo damn cool. Little did I know my roll was going to be blow torched, literally, to produce the 'fire' resulting in a slightly burnt rice taste with every bite. Not to worry, the yummy seaweed salad made up for it. 

The portions are generous where the service is not at all.  With Aji Sai on its left and Hosu on its right, I cant see any reason to come back here.",2
707,2,1548201600000,"My co-worker and I have seen construction going on in Noodle & Co's tidy corner of market square and were anxious to try it out.

I had the Pad Thai with Tofu and boy was it underwhelming. The noodles were covered in an almost sickeningly sweet ""chili"" sauce. There were few vegetables, mostly carrots, and no attempt at any sort of condiment (peanuts, vinegar, fish sauce, etc.) other than a few bean sprouts. The Sriracha was really what saved the dish. The tofu was barely warm and pretty chewy.

The menu, and items therein, seem to be developed to appeal to broad and bland american palate. There are around 20 noodle dishes in three different categories, ""Asian"", ""Mediterranean"", and ""American"" as well as 5 sandwich dishes.

Overall strikes me as a Panera Bread trying to piggy back on fresh concepts like Chipotle's success. Probably not the most fair assessment, but we were expecting a brothy Asian noodle hangout and this was far from that.

All that said, the prices are probably fair, especially affordable if you go sans meat/tofu although I would really appreciate an extra veggie option.",2
714,2,1548115200000,"Yesterday was my first time ever for a facial at Aveda. The salon is really nice and clean. The spa is on the top floor and it is very quiet and relaxing. The staff is super friendly, they offered me tea (and I dont even like tea but this one was really good). The girl who took care of me was Eva. She is super nice and friendly, and she did a fantastic job. She makes you feel very relaxed and comfortable and her massages are amazing. The facial was 70$+tip. My face is usually extremely red after a facial because I have very sensitive skin, but yesterday was not bad at all. The extractions doesn't hurt compared to other places. The only cons would be that the don't extract milia around the eyes, and I would have liked a deeper extraction. Very good experience overall. I will definitely be back!

*UPDATED:
All the skin products I bought (cleanser, moisturizer, toner and essential oil) gave me really bad allergic reactions. Be careful if you have sensitive skin as a big number of Aveda products contain lavender. Lavender is NOT good for sensntive skin EVER. I had a terrible rash all over my face for 3 weeks. I could return the products but they gave me a gift card, not cash back. Now I have 150$ in an Aveda card that most likely I'll give to someone because I am not going to use any of their products ever again. So be careful if you have sensitive skin. Try little samples before buying any skincare product.",3
715,2,1547164800000,"I honestly just don't get it. I went here because I wanted to meet a friend relatively close to Union Station and wanted to eat something good. There are a lot of pricier joints downtown so I opted for Corrado's. It looked like it was going to be cheap + delicious arancini and italian-style sandwiches. I was rather disappointed when I actually ate it.

I love arancini. I love rice, and love rice with creaminess. And fried, crispy breading? Arancini is a delicious union of the two. Unfortunately Corrado's arancini doesn't quite measure up. Sure, they're pretty big, and the filling is actually creamy and tasty, but I don't see the point of smothering the arancini with tomato sauce as you can't taste any of the crunch or crispiness of the breading, and makes it just taste like I made rice with cream of mushroom sauce and pasta sauce. 

The sandwich wasn't anything spectacular either. I much prefer Porchetta, Club Sandwich, or even my own sandwiches. Maybe the other menu options are better. Who know's, I'd much rather spend my time and money elsewhere.",2

Small place with some outdoor seating which I took advantage of on an unusually warm October day. I got the veal sandwich (of course) and it was FABULOUS. 
Made fresh to order, instead of scooping a soggy veal out of a tub that's been sitting for hours...the veal itself was a huge portion with no stringy or tough parts, the edges were beautifully crispy..geez just writing this review is getting my mouth watering with the memory of this awesome sandwich.

So my 4 stars are taking in the assumption that this is what it SHOULD taste like and that is delicious, minus the white tea I drank, but that was my fault.  

This past Saturday I had hit the West Side Market for some shopping and had brought my wife and our new work friend from India that some met at the Yelp party, Mridul.  We decided to come here because we wanted something unique, quick, and easy on the wallet.  I convinced them by showing Cara's review because the wife loves Pad Thai where I personally have never tried it.  Mridul was limited to chicken, chicken, or chicken so PP (Ha) was right down his alley.

For the appetizer we tried the PP Spring Rolls (4) and we all thought those were fantastic.  The peanut dipping sauce went perfectly with the fried chicken / veggie 'smaller version of egg rolls'.  The wife, as predictable as they come, went with the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai mild heat.  This was spot on.  Very tasty, I mean I could eat this 3 days a week for lunch.  It was weird for me to see the whole dish basically reddish orange with sprinkled peanuts and sprouts because I really couldn't tell the difference between the noodles and the carrots.....again, this is my first time here so I quickly realize what a rookie I was.  Mridul went with the Chicken Fried Rice, medium spice, with a scrambled egg inside.  This was really good too, a dish I would recommend if a rice dish is your desire.  I went with the Spicy Pork Pad Thai medium heat for 2 reasons.   1) I originally wanted the chicken but wifey beat me to it and 2) I wanted to see if there was a noticeable difference between chicken and pork, which upon tasting, there really was.  Although all dishes were great, we all decided that the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai was our favorites.  We also all decided that the heat needed to be upgraded to the medium level, not mild.  

What a great first time.  I will be back and also want to try Pad Thai somewhere else to see how it compares.  Very cute place, and really reasonable.  Be forewarned though, they only take cash.",2

The Captain Hashbrown comes with hash browns, bacon, cheddar cheese, onion, green bell pepper, and egg. Sounds typical except for the onion and green bell pepper (which gives it a little depth and taste much better, as for typical breakfast burritos). But there are 2 key things that make me a fan

1. The egg was cooked like a scrambled egg pancake But  the yolk wasn't cooked through (not runny yolk). This little detail was Brilliant!!

2. I don't know if its the oil or seasoning of the hashbrowns, onions, green peppers but it has a certain goodness to it.. Again, that something brings it another step away from the norm.. Yum!

I'll usually sit around and wait, but it's a little unfair to expect your customers to understand why a business isn't open on time.

The decor is nothing to speak of - just a plain, down home small counter-service restaurant with some sights & sounds of Chicago. The guys who have worked the counter were nothing but sweet. 

I've only had the Italian beef and cheese fries. The Italian beef tastes about as Chicago-authentic as authentic gets - so much au jus too! The cheese fries were decent - maybe a little too salty for my taste, but in general good. I think my combo + a drink have been about $8 - great value!

808,2,1547337600000,"Politics aside, the Trump Hotel was a very good experience. We were in town for an event at the Convention Center. 

Pros:
Friendliness of the staff! From check in to check out, they were unbelievably accommodating and friendly. 

Amenities in the room. Full kitchen (which is the reason we booked there to begin with. A lot of places in Vegas do not have a kitchen). It had a sink, fridge, toaster, stove top, tea kettle, microwave, Keurig coffee maker, and cabinets. As a nice touch, they had Rio Blend coffee in the room. Maybe because of the 2016 Olympics coming up? Also had paper coffee cups, sweeteners, creamer cups, and stirring sticks. Due to county regulations, they are not allowed to keep plates, silverware, etc in the room but will bring them to your room if needed. 

They also included an iron, ironing board, blow dryer, light up mirror, bathrobe, and plenty of fluffy towels. 

The bathroom has a TV inside the mirror. Didn't use it but interesting touch. Spa tub and separate shower. Marble counters and floors. Water heated up VERY quickly. 

The pillows!!! Oh the pillows! I have to find the Downrite brand online or in Macy's or something because they were divine. Beds were comfy too. 

Our room even had a DOORBELL on it instead of the bellboy knocking, he rang a door bell! LOL

The AC was amazing and cooled the room quickly and kept it cool. 

Very quiet. We never once heard any other guests. All the appliances in the room were quiet as well. 

The elevators. Fast. Ya know how some hotels you stand there forever waiting on the elevator? Not here. I timed it. It took 13 seconds to get from the 39th floor to the lobby. Unreal. 

The ice machines are in their own little rooms in the hallways so you don't have to listen to someone getting ice in the middle of the night. 

It is right across from a huge mall. Lots of shops and a large food court. 

Cons:

The train. Yes, you read that correctly. There was a train that ran behind the hotel where our room was facing that ran every couple of hours throughout the night and woke us up each time. As it came up to an intersection, it would blow its horn over and over. But this is where the nice staff came in handy. They were more than willing and helpful to move us to a room facing The Strip in exchange for a small extra fee because it was a room facing The Strip. We could still hear the train in the distance but not enough to wake us up. We only heard it before heading to bed. 

Valet. Yes, I know that valet was supposed to be bougie and helpful, however, we found it bothersome. It's just easier to have access to our car when needed. On the other hand there was a relatively short wait time so it wasn't too bad. However, that depends on your timing. Some times of the day were very busy. 

Internet. It was a bit slow. So if you are someone there on business who needs fast internet for work, this may become an issue. 

Sleeper sofa. We pulled out the sleep sofa that our original room included. For a 5 star place, there should be a nicer one. It was just your run of the mill, feel every spring, mattress. 

No casino. For me personally, this was not a problem but if you going to Vegas to gamble, this may be an issue for you. 

Not on The Strip. The only reason this is a issue is because of the heat. If you want to go out and walk The Strip, you also have to add to that walk because you have to get from the hotel to Las Vegas Blvd. It's not too far but the heat is what does it.

Thie slices were reheated and not as fresh as I had hoped. If you come here, then I highly recommend ordering something that is made on to order such as a whole pie or a hoagie.

Flat screen tvs in the living room, bed room and bathroom were pretty cool. There was a fantastic view of Vegas from the room. There was a small kitchen plus a hot tub! The wall insulation was perfect because we didn't hear any noise from our neighbors. 

The negatives are the $15 valet service, $10 wifi fee,check out time is 10am and they wouldn't give us a late checkout, but the most annoying thing were the thick, pillows that were extremely uncomfortable.

854,1,1548806400000,"Probably a great spot ... if you're not vegetarian.

Only two veggie entree options on the menu: noodle soup and noodle bowl. The soup broth is fragrant and tasty. In the bowl you get a pile of noodles and barely any veggies: a pinch of shredded carrot, a pinch of pickled something else, and a single, tiny, almost cute bok choy. So unless you've come to carb up before a marathon, the meal isn't healthy or satisfying.

And, no, they don't have tofu.

They have veggie options, so that's something. But when there are so many other good veggie options out there, why bother.",2

   The food on the other hand was real good.  I ordered a Paris pizza which I never really order but thoroughly enjoyed. It even had brie which I do not like but really went well. Wife had the lasagna which again was very good.

Dinner. We had an awesome wine recommendation, so perhaps the vino impacted my rating!  They brought out a seafood platter that could have fed an army: oysters, lobster tail, shrimp...unbelievable. 

Most of the table ordered steaks, and raved. I was just not in the mood, so I ordered french onion soup and buttermilk fried chicken breast. I never order fried chicken...but the server was correct that it was a hidden jewel on the menu. Moist, and Southern comfort food at its best.

They have a few membership levels- Business, Gold Member and Premium.  The Premium level you earn 2% back on all your purchases.  They do give you two cards for the price that you pay, so you can go in with a neighbor and each get a card.

In addition to electronics, photo lab, optical center, bakery, meat department, they also have a little know ""clearance"" section at each Sam's.  You just have to know where it is.  Also when they are clearancing out merchandise, the price will end in a ""1"".  Most common is .71 or .81.  I have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for .71 a bag, and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret.

They do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves.  They also will give cookies to children.

My boys also love the cafe where they get their ""pizza and drink please.""  Their menu has changed  a lot lately though and I am not sure if I like it.  Prices are very reasonable though.

They also have gasoline pumps outside which if you know your prices can be a good thing!

If you are not satified with your membership, you can cancel at anytime and they will prorate your membership refund.  Their refund policy is really good as well.",1

Only problem I found is the tempura is placed in the soup prior to arriving at the table, and therefore it was soggy and was falling apart.  Screaming Orgasm has a small and a large option, and comes on a bed of shredded radish (daikon).  Heavy sauce but it gives it a good flavor.  Overall the service is quick, but there were two times that the communication fell apart and two items did not make it to our table without a reminder that we were waiting for items.  If you get your items and are missing anything, it is best to just assume they may have forgotten or communication broke down, so give a friendly reminder.

I have been going to this location for over 20 years and the line never moved as slowly as it did today. There were very few people in line when I walked in but it was quite a while before anyone asked for my order. Both the people in front of me and behind me in line commented they had also never seen the line move so slowly, and they were also long-time customers.

I tried to figure it out since I counted five staff members on the line; one on the grill, one handling drinks and shakes (which left her just standing there most of the time), one putting the condiments on the orders, one at the register, and one handling the fries and onion rings. The only thing I could think of was the staff was new. One person looked vaguely familiar but other than that I didn't recognize anyone, and another person said ""I've never seen these people before."" The employees weren't horsing around; everything just moved very, very slowly.

Because I drove in from so far away I hung in there until I got my order, but if I lived closer I would have been long gone.  I don't like downgrading my initial positive review but I think management needs to be aware they have a customer service issue--at least they had one today around 6:00-7:00 p.m.

Ted's in Tempe has been a favorite of mine since the early 90's.  Though currently residing in Queen Creek, it's worth the trip now and then for a delicious, charbroiled jumbo all beef dog.  So many places come and go, but it's great that Ted's has been at the same location for years. Hope they remain for a long, long time.

11/8/09: Found myself at Ted's again today [along with a few other times since posting this review].  Same great dogs, and this time got the fries and onion rings--so good. Same quick service too. So glad to see their business is booming during these less-than-great economic times. Long Live Ted's !!!

01/07/2014 - Ted's still delivers the goods. Since I live in San Tan Valley now (we formerly borrowed Queen Creek's name) I don't get out there often, though have been there a few times since the last update).

Ordered a Reuben sandwich and a bottle of water. Sandwich was made fresh and hot to order.

The sandwich was huge! I could only eat half of it and took the other half to go. Sandwich was tasty!

The guy running the place was nice.

The only thing I will ding the place on is the parking situation. There was no available parking on the street - meaning every available spot was already occupied. I had driven over from my hotel and being from out-of-town had no idea I would not be able to find a place to park. So I ended up paying to park in a pay lot next to the building the Deli is located within.

They only serve breakfast, and the menu isn't up on the board as that is full of all the bakery treats and beverages. I'd love to see a larger menu, or even some menus by the door for more accessibility. Luckily I knew about the food from yelp, so I just asked the people in front of me to pass a menu back.

My experience with this company was horrific. It is bad enough that your vehicle gets towed but then to have to deal with an agency that is dishonest, rude, unscrupulous and participates in the behavior of cheating the public , makes the experience that much worse.

Instead, they hold your car for an additional 3 days and charge you $30 a day simply telling you that it's not their job to provide you with  truthful answers to the questions you've asked. Great job DV TOWING, robbing the public and generating gain on the back of this cities residents. I will be going a step further and reporting them.

So first and foremost the clientele is all different ages, I love this and we strive hard to create a true community. We offer 4 different types of classes majority of which are 60 minutes, 3 out of the 4 are heated and 3 out of the 4 are sequenced. I first came to my yoga mat in Denver at CorePower, upon moving back to Arizona I could not find a comparable format or studio. So I made due and traveled a lot around the valley.  We have been open since September of 2015 and while we do have clientele from ASU, we also have a Tempe studio opening up this Month (March 2016) right across from ASU. Guess what you get your first week free, no other studio does that. Trust me I know (remember above the traveling I talked about).  With that being said come give it a try and hey guess what when you join one CorePower you can use them all.

1128,3,1548460800000,"We came here for a big group lunch during a weekend wedding in AZ. I had super high hopes based on what we had been told and how cute it was upon pulling up, but I was unfortunately not impressed. 

The atmosphere is cute for sure. It is an order at the counter sort of place but their branding is nice and it doesn't feel like every other place in AZ. While I do think that's great, it wasn't even close to enough to bring up my review of the food. 

The food was not good. And not just mine ... nobody at our whole table particularly enjoyed their meal (and we are talking 10 people eating like 6 different things)? The burgers were under cooked and juicing out bloody burger juice. The veggies on the burgers didn't look or taste fresh. My chicken was super gristly and battered with the blandest batter I've ever had. The ribs were dry and mediocre. Even the kids barely touched theirs? It just wasn't a good experience. I know we sent back two burgers to be cooked longer but with how busy it was and the sorts of issues we were having, the rest wasn't even worth trying to fix. 

And the thing that made this all even worse is that this place isn't too cheap? If I want to have a crappy burger or chicken I'll go to McDonald's and spend $5 but just my boyfriend and I paid like $30 something bucks for food that we hated and were literally so hungry we ate another meal at another restaurant about an hour later? You can eat MUCH better for that money.

I will say their garlic fries were ok - definitely the best food on the table (which is kinda sad). And the chocolate shake was DELICIOUS. After trying mine, two other girls at our table ordered some. So I guess if you just want a shake and fries I recommend it but I travel to AZ often and I won't be back to this spot.",3

I'm not a restaurant owner so who am I to complain:-) The beef tips, baked chicken and pineapple lemonade had to be some of the best items on the menu, but I digress. The sweet potato waffle and fried chicken is pretty good, the waffle looks a little weird but the taste compensates for that. The mac n cheese can be suspect, but lately it has been on point. The fried whiting is very good but the pieces of fish are just way too big/thick or something, maybe it was just that day. The fried corn on the cob is very good and highly recommended.

Based on reviews, I started with the Tuna poke wonton tacos. I loved the presentation of the three tacos in a mini metal toast rack. The Tuna was fresh, spicy and flavorful and the tacos were crispy and crunchy. Simply divine!!

Based on the fabulous waitresses recommendation, I had the Grilled cheese, smoked bacon and tomato soup dumplings. This dish blew my mind!! Creative and inventive cuisine that's artfully executed and presented. You get six dumplings served on individual lacquer Chinese spoons. The dumplings were delicious and bursting with flavor. I'd go back for this dish alone it was so good.

Next, I had the Cauliflower which was cooked and presented in a small stone or metal dish that kept the cauliflower warm. The vegetable was cooked in ginger salsa verde with pickled scallions and had the most unique and amazing flavor of any vegetable dish I'd ever had.

Sadly, I ate too much for lunch and was starting to feel full. I was desperate to try the Thai style deep fried shrimp or the Short rib mac and cheese which were both highly recommended and sounded delicious. Instead, I opted to splurge calorie wise and get the KYGO Cloud Nine ""S"" smores. I loved the creative presentation as the dish was topped with a giant marshmallow cloud. I found the marshmallow overly sweet and it overpowered the flavor of the dark chocolate torte below. 

The restaurant has a large, inventive cocktail list broken out into sweet and savory categories. There is an extensive wine list and about 4-5 wines by the glass in each category: sparking, white and red. I had several glasses of the Tempranillo. Prices ranged from $11-16 for most, which is really good value for Vegas where there are so many $18+ glasses.

Amazing atmosphere and service!! Best meal of the entire trip. I will be back in Las Vegas in January and this will be my #1 restaurant choice and I'm already dreaming of trying the Roasted bone marrow toast and Oven braised chicken meatballs and savoring every bite of the big wow grilled cheese dumplings.

We started with the pretzel fondue , it is large and enough for four people so the $9 is fair and it did taste good but neither me or my companion tasted provolone cheese in the sauce , the cheese sauce tasted like grilled American cheese and butter and the color was same as orange American cheese . The pretzels were fresh and somewhat rich . 

We saw our order being ran out to another table , we knew it was ours and then we saw it go back to the open kitchen and a few minutes latter it came back to us and you enjoy your food slightly less when you see it sit in front of people you don't know . 

My companion ordered the beef short rib stew with green chili's and corn bread . The stew with packed with big chunks of very tender tasty meat but instead of corn bread a tortilla was given . 

I had the chopped salmon salad and was surprised that the fish was a smoked fish and I think the menu should have said that and I do wonder if we didn't order the pretzel fondue if I would have received a roll or fancy cracker with my ($13) salad bread or cracker didn't come with it . 

My salad was an Above Average Salad instead of the normal mix of greens the base of salad was marinated Kale and the other components of the salad were roasted cauliflower , currants and Marcona Almonds dressed perfect not too much .

1248,1,1547769600000,"A few hours of swimming at Temptations Pool Party at the Luxor, you work up an appetite. My boyfriend, his best friend, and I decided to check this place out after finding out the AYCE Chinese Buffet next door turned into a Dim Sum a la carte restaurant. The place was fairly cramped with the booths real close to your gut. It was almost like my man boobs were actually sitting on the table when we were done. We all decided to get the AYCE sushi dinner (1 hour time limit), which was fairly priced.

The service was fast and so was the sushi that came from the sushi bar for the first 15 rolls. Most of the flavors seemed to have originated from Korean style, Kim chee especially the ahi poke. 90% of the rolls that came to the table were drenched or overly sauced. When I go to a Japanese restaurant, I expect my sushi to come out fresh, with natural flavors. So all the sauces on these rolls today, is masking the low quality fish.

The last 5 orders depreciated the ratings of this place.  They should watch the quality of all their products, especially the ""mini beef platter"", the meat tasted past due. So guess who had the runs for the past day and a half? So I didn't know if the meat was actually meant to be on the fermented side, cause the whole Korean influence, or they were trying to sneak away with serving the meat til it was sold out so their food cost wouldn't be so high. There was a sushi roll that had corn and grilled onions on top of it, like who does that? With over powering, mayo based sauce drenching the rolls underneath, It would be awesome if all their rolls came with a description of what's inside or on top, My boyfriend is allergic to tomatoes, citrus, and onions. So then my ramen came out. I was thinking it would be a homemade ramen noodle, with a nice broth. Nope, top ramen, Kim chee flavored, with a sprig of green onion, dusted with more Kim chee seasoning!

If. It weren't for the e.coli infested beef tips, the drenched and soggy rolls, the mediocre tempura ice cream, and the southwestern, over kill on the onions on top of the sushi, or the imitation ramen, I'd given this whole in the wall a higher rating!",2

The brussel sprouts were tasty, but not anything special. The BBQ pork stuffed macaroni shells were a flavor combination that didn't work, the pork was too sweet, and the white cheddar cheese sauce had an odd texture, bordering on slimy. The Caesar salad was ok, but, due to their anything-goes coursing style, was the last dish we received. Again, nothing special.

Not only is their staff rude and not helpful at all they are just terrible. It is worth spending an extra $100 or even more to fly with someone else. Their plane broke down and when I get back to ask for refund they want to give me a voucher to use their crap airline again. Not only did they tell me that I would get reimbursed for renting car to drive since they did not have another plane to fly us for 2 days but that they would reimbursed us for the trip. Once I got back to request for these they do not want to refund me at all but give me a trip voucher. We lost so much time and money since it took us 8 hours to drive and spend money to rent a car and fill up with gas. Such shit airline and customer service no wonder they are going down and have to merge with US Airways. They could care less what your situation is even if their airplane had mechanical issues and had no other planes for 2 days and too cheap to reimburse you for the trip since it made everything difficult. NEVER AGAIN AA. Oh and we had to transfer flights coming home and we were late and almost missed our transfer flight. The stewardess could care less to let us off the plane first to run to make our transfer flight. Since they all had boarded already they gave us crap for coming late when it was not even our fault. Think twice before ever booking with this airline. HATE AA and their staff!",2
1340,2,1548547200000,"""Holy cow, this man just gave me 'f**k me hair'!"" that's what I thought when Eric spun me around to the mirror today after styling my hair. You know how you start writing the yelp review as soon as you enter the place? When I saw myself all thoughts left me except 'christ I look good.' 

It would be dismissive to give GwE 5 stars based only on their premise of Organic hair care and styling, but I might have done it anyway because I really truly believe that everyone needs to read the ingredient labels of all the products they use (hair, face, body) and really think about what dubious chemistry is seeping into their bodies every day. I will be a Green with Envy girl for the rest of my stay here in the Valley, not only because their business philosophy is ethical and whole-hearted but because they have excellent stylists. 

Today I saw Eric Flotta who was nice enough to take me as soon as he came in, even though I was half an hour early. And he didn't scream in horror at my post-workout hair, just led me over to the sink to start my wash/style/blowdry.  He told me about some of the organic products that the salon uses and carries for retail purchase and even mentioned that GwE uses the first and only hair color that doesn't include toxic chemicals. 

Eric didn't do any wild and crazy hair makeover on me, but my hair does look very sexy and different. I like that he could take my frightening mess and turn it into something simple and beautiful in not a lot of time and with minimal product in it.  He recommended a product to me and though I am a staunchly opposed to buying salon hair care I did because it's organic and makes me look nice! 

Also, they have a $35 women's haircut special which proves that earth-friendly organics can be luxurious AND affordable.  Now I want them to get some formaldehyde-free nail polishes and start up some manicures and pedicures!",2

The pizza is ridiculously overpriced, $17 for an 11-inch pizza?

Our server was a little aggressive, he even complained about his other customers to us.  Who knew what he was saying about us?   He also must have thought we were stupid because he kept explaining the difference between sausage  and pepperoni?  REALLY?

The server really ruined this meal for us, he even tried some adult humor with the serving of the beer.  I'll leave it at that.  So the food never had a chance, we just wanted to leave.

If you eat here...take your time, the pizza comes out real fast.

Being from New Jersey, we know and appreciate good pizza...this was mediocre at best.

We won't be returning.",2

They're extremely helpful and friendly, even if it's 5:30 in the morning.  The coffee choices are always fresh, and the bagel sandwiches they make have never disappoint either.  I usually get the egg, spinach, mushroom and swiss.  The sandwich is always carefully assembled.  The spinach and mushroom are drained properly before being placed on your sandwich, so they neither turn the bagel to mush nor drip as you're trying to eat.  It's this attention to detail that makes me look forward to eating here.  I just wish they were open for dinner - they close late afternoon.",2

They were very polite not the cleanliness of places but they were very nice their food I can't say the same about it was gross and believe me I love my Vietnamese soup. So beware unless you like an overpowering cinnamon flavor don't eat it. We also had their spring rolls not the greatest at all. So will not be going again.,2

Don't get me wrong, there have always been cool spots down here, but the dark atmosphere coupled with killer live music made Monroe's second to none. I saw Paris James for the first time here years ago and it was one of the best live music sessions that I have been fortunate enough to witness. 

The sign is still on the outside of the building and the space remains vacant. Like that childhood love that you always compared others to, Monroe's is that bar that I always size others up to the moment I walk in. I'll hold on to my hopes that perhaps they will open their doors back up so I can grab a Ruben sandwich (their Ruben was one of the best I've had) and some whisky waters, and let my ears bask in the heartfelt melodies emanating from the strings of the featured musician.",3

1440,3,1546387200000,"I am at the Sun Prairie Costco location almost every day. The location is great, in one of the fastest-growing areas in the U.S. (2017.) Their quality is outstanding, and their staff is a friendly team that always seems to genuinely enjoy working together. 

This location moves a LOT of merchandise and rotates their inventory continuously, so it goes without saying that if you see something you think you might enjoy owning and don't grab it immediately, you may not get a second chance. 

There's very little risk of buyer's remorse thanks to Costco's very liberal return policy. I don't relish chances to return things, but the handful of times I've been legitimately unsatisfied with the quality of a product, they have taken it back, no questions asked. 

Lastly, Costco has absolutely, hands-down, the best crab legs you will ever have the chance to buy. They put grocery store crab legs to shame, and I've found them to be of better size and quality of meat than even specialty seafood retailers in Elm Grove and Downtown Milwaukee, as a comparison. Like nearly everything, Costco's seafood has increased in price over the past year, but is still well worth splurging for.",2

1445,1,1548460800000,"One of the tougher entry level hikes in Red Rock.  Be prepared to complete destroy normal running or walking shoes on the sand stone and sharp rocks on the way.  There is no clear path up but if you follow the trail signs, then stick to the left of the gully on the way up you should see many footpaths.  You want to aim yourself to be about 100 feet to the left of the flat rock face/wall of Turtlehead, then wrap around the back and up.  

Kids who are used to hiking and listen to their guardians (about not going near the edge) will enjoy the hike.  We've had 8-10 year olds out a few times and I've seen dogs a couple times.  I would not recommend dogs without protective booties though on their feet.  They'd get torn up :(

Be careful of the cactus and sharp bushes -- bring gloves just in case you take a slight tumble.  I've seen many people pulling 2 inch thorns out of their hands here.  Watch your step, drink plenty of water and enjoy the view.

Red Rock has roughly 12 other peaks in the park on the scenic loop which are not marked trails by the park though they are well established by the hiking community.  Check out Juniper Peak, Rainbow Peak, Bridge Mountain, or if you are feeling adventurous White Pinnacle Peak.  Juniper is my favorite for a good 3-4 hour hike!",2
1448,2,1548892800000,"I had high hopes for this garage and had taken my car there once for an inspection with good results.

Last week I asked if they could change my oil. The man said to drop the car off on Thursday night and leave the key in the key drop, he would get the job done on Friday. I left the car in the lot, dropped the key in the slot, and came back for it on Friday afternoon even though I had no phone call telling me it was ready for pickup.

To my surprise, the shop was closed during Friday business hours when I arrived! Nobody was around, the car had not been touched, my key was still inside the shop, and the phone number was going to voicemail. I left without my car.

I called again on Saturday. Voicemail again. No car. Called again on Sunday. Voicemail again. No car. Finally someone answered on Monday. I told him I would be there to pick up my car in the afternoon and was told they would be closing early, and would be closed by the time I got there. Unbelievable.

I managed to arrange to get my car back finally after FOUR DAYS. Luckily I was able to make do without it by bothering my friends and borrowing their cars when I needed to go somewhere, and had no emergencies, but imagine if I actually needed to use my own vehicle! Unprofessional and unacceptable. I would not recommend using this garage unless you are comfortable with not getting your car back for days with no communication because they decided not to work that day for some unknown reason.

No apology. No discount. When I brought up the fact that they left me stranded for four days the man on the phone said 'that's between you and the other guy'... I will never take my car here again.",2

I meet a running group close by and after our run we normally meet at Blasted Barley for a couple beers & fries. For as often as I've been here, that's pretty much all I've tried. One time our waitress convinced a few of us to try what she referred to as ""vegetarian"" wings (mozzarella sticks that are covered in the ""dynamite"" wing sauce) that were very tasty. The fries here are yummy as well. 

They have a good HH for beer. All of the beers they brew themselves, plus all local beers are $3 a pint until 7. The couple of beers they brew that I've tried were good (I really like the Orca, but they haven't had it in a couple months). They also do a ""lucky lady"" special ($3 for a ""surprise"" brown bag canned beer). Sometimes a few of us will try this. A lot of the time it's Keystone or Nati Ice, often times they'll have something good from San Tan brewery.

I had a grapefruit drink and my boyfriend had a cucumber one. Sammy informed us that all the vodkas are in house infused with the fruits and veggies. Which is a good touch because they really were some of the best cocktails we had. Then our appetizer arrived. Sammy had ordered us the cheddar fondue which came with warm soft pretzels, sausage, apple slices, and of course cedar fondue. Shortly after or dinners arrived he order my boyfriend a burger and fries best burger I've tried since I moved to AZ hands down. Sammy had ordered me the skewers. That came with a little bit of everything. Chicken, beef, veggies and shrimp skewers. Also can with a red pepper dip and this amazing honey muster glaze sauce which I put on everything!!!!

The bonus is they have a punch card - after 10 punches you get $25 off any service.  Everyone was very kind and friendly.  Can't ask for more!",2

Today we ordered their boneless  wings, large order $16.99...very disappointed  as we got about 20 small nuggets (size of a quarter)and 3 carrot sticks and 3 celery  sticks. Not worthy of  the price Thank goodness we had a great server/bartender Wilfred who made it a memorable girls lunch experience with his great customer  service and understanding,  even with  our complaints he kept his big smile and extra celery and carrot sticks.

She came up with a plan to do a few chemical peels in order to get my skin ready for microneedling. I've now had three microneedling treatments done and my skin looks amazing! She showed me a picture of my skin when I first went to see her and I didn't even think the person in the photo was me because my skin had transformed so much. My skin has never looked better and it's all thanks to Hailey! Can't wait until my next treatment!!,2

The arcade machine that gave cards to play wasn't user friendly. We had to try multiple times on multiple machines to get them. We had fun bowling and playing games despite the glitches.,2

1568,3,1546992000000,"I'm always wary about switching to a new hair stylist because it's so easy for your ""just a trim"" to turn into several inches of missing hair. However, after moving to Toronto I knew I would have to take the leap and find a new stylist, and after reading good reviews for this salon I decided to give it a try.

I was booked with Effie for a haircut, and she was very professional and easy to talk to and joke with from the moment I walked in. She offered me a tea or coffee and we went over what I wanted with my hair, and she did a fabulous job! I have very thick hair and I felt like I lost 5 lbs after she was done thinning it. I'm also not usually a fan of how my hair is styled after the cut, but she made it look amazing and I was kind of sad I didn't have any plans after my appointment to show it off.

The best part is their complimentary bang trims between cuts - they encourage you to come back every 2 weeks and always seem to have time to get someone to trim them right away, so I never feel like I have to deal with bangs in my eyes or have to cut them myself between appointments.",2

1584,3,1547510400000,"We decided to try out Joey Crowfoot.  We haven't eaten here for a long time.  Service was pretty good.  We ordered the following:

Mushroom Cheddar Burger with added Beach Salad - Really, juicy burger and that beach salad - so refreshing!

Blackened Basa Fish Dinner - really tasty basa meal; spice was just right!

Bombay Butter Chicken - great bowl of butter chicken with carrots, basmati rice on a small banana leaf, papadum.  Great blend of everything.

Sicilian Shrimp Linguine - Soooooo delicious!  It's a pesto sauce of pine nuts, currants, and all kinds of good stuff,   Lots of baby shrimp but done really well.

I'd come back just for the Siciilian Shrimp Linguine!!",1
1589,3,1548028800000,"Well disappointed with the selection at the buffet, I knew we should have gone to the cafe instead. Waited on a refill on my soda and didn't see the waitress in awhile. Just as we were about to leave she shows up with a fresh Pepsi . I'm never coming back here",2
1597,2,1546819200000,"My mom has been dying to check out Cabo Wabo for while because she loves Sammy Haggar! It was much better than we expected being a chain and after reading all of the negative reviews. It really exceeded our expectations. 

We started with the house margarita and they were delicious and strong. Probably better than any margarita I've had. I went with the shrimp tacos and they were really good, they also came with rice and beans. The whole meal was really filling. The pork tacos are also worth a mention if swine is your thing. If you're gonna try one thing, try the chimichangas. They were on the 'specials' menu that day and had beef and queso cheese, I'm craving these right now! 

The service left a little to be desired and I wish that chips and salsa were complimentary (they are $3). 

All in all I would definitely check this place out if you love tequila, Mexican, or Sammy Haggar. You also have a great view of the Bellagio fountains if you sit on the patio.",2
1598,1,1546992000000,"So lets begin with the fact that this review is due to the performance of a single employee at this location who ruined the entire experience. 

a few friends and I came in to grab a quick and delicious meal at what has always been one of my favorite little places. got in just before the rush, which is always nice.

everything was fine until we reached the condiments section of the building process. the young lady has no sense of any kind of listening skills.
My fiance asked for hot salsa, cheese and guacamole... instead he got lettuce... i don't know on what planet lettuce and guacamole sound the same but whatever, maybe its because they are the same color.... when we cried out ""no!!!'"" the young woman looked up at us, she rolled her eyes at me and said ""what?"" thats what you ordered."" I looked at her and said, ""no, he said guacamole."" and the dialogue continued...

chipotle girl- ""do you want me to take it off?""
fiance -""yes please that would be great""
CG- ""there its off"" (still a mountain of lettuce covering the majority of the burrito)
fiance - ""can you please get at least the big pieces off please? or could you maybe remake it?""

instead of removing the rest or just simply remaking the item she literally takes guacamole and covers the remaining lettuce and rolls the burrito closed.

CG - ""its fine the way it is""

Last time i check its not your call as to if its ""fine"" or not. another girl standing on the line next to her made a face to me as if to say ""oh my god i'm sorry she's crazy""

the problem associate then with a fierce attitude tossed the item into a basket and almost knocked it off of the counter.

I've literally NEVER has a worse experience from any other establishment. the manager on duty was busy so i chose not to bother her - the restaurant was beginning to fill and i didn't want to take away from anyone else's experience.

In closing I'm pretty sure mouthing off to a customer isn't in the chipotle employee handbook... our entire group was completely taken aback by the complete disregard for any kind of professionalism. 

I know it seems silly but I was really upset by it.",2
1602,1,1548547200000,"I am a regular patron in this restaurant. I enjoy the food, the drink specials, and the interesting people that work there. I come here for the big portions of reasonably priced decent Americanized Mexican fare and the people watching. The manager Chemin is a friend.

1603,1,1547078400000,"I think the low scores are here because this place is great at making only one thing on their menu. 

that item is the  teriyaki bowls, their other menu items not so good.

1609,3,1546905600000,"We went here for my bachelor party. I wasn't drunk when I ate, so I can say that I'm able to write an honest review.

I ordered the dry aged NY sirloin. The portions are huge, and it was cooked perfectly. I tried my friend's porterhouse, and that was even larger, but well cooked. We ordered some sides, including mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and mac & cheese. Overall, service was really good as well.

If you want to finish your steak comfortably, I recommend skipping the bread they give you at the beginning.

By the way, we ate in the other room, and it was all guys - not a single girl in the room. I wonder if that's the all guys' party room.",2

1623,2,1547078400000,VERY VERY good. I love this place. I was a virgin until this week. Great creative sandwiches and friendly staff. I had the the Bear Hug. It was amazing!,2
1628,2,1546560000000,This place had us pretty impatient the whole time! I shared a pizza with my significant other and he asked for half of it to have no onions but it came out covered in onions all over! It then took a half an hour to split the bill. To be honest i wasn't very impressed by the food.,2
1632,3,1546819200000,"Quality went down. Their curry lentil is TERRIBLE! It's like curry chicken without the chicken or anything else, just liquid. I called up and apparently it's supposed to be like that. I'm sorry but that is NOT curry lentil. The chicken feta salad is still decent but it is smaller now. I liked the vinaigrette that had seasonings in it and now its just oil and vinegar. I haven't had their pita sandwiches yet. I usually get the chicken feta pita but at this rate I probably will just save my money. The staff was nice and attentive before. The occasional new girl would suck but overall good service. I'm not sure about now. Haven't ate in yet because their prices are ridiculous!",2

1637,3,1547596800000,"Went in to get a simple nostril piercing. According to their website (Under Piercing - Process) they will sterilize your jewlery for you and pierce at a discounted price. Being that I am on a budget and have a sensitivity to nickel, I brought in my own titanium nostril screw because I've had a previous Stainless Steel piercing bubble, pop and bleed profusely and I had to take it out, whereas Titanium has been safe for me in the past. However upon arrival I was met with confusion about my inquiry and told that they only use their own jewlery, and that being pierced with their own titanium jewlery costs $95.00. I opted for Stainless Steel again because the girl (did not catch name, sorry!) assured me it was nickel free and that reactions are unusual. So, I hope the previous reaction to the nose ring was my fault somehow. I am honestly not trying to spend $95.00 on anything! I'm not balling like that.

My piercer was Nic and my experience was fine. He was polite and everything looked tidy. After piercing I was given some aftercare instructions and a small bag of salt.

It cost $65 to have a nostril pierced here, and I do find that pricey. I went elsewhere to have a nostril done last year and it was half the price. However, I'm not sure how piercing places determine their prices. Being to three different places to attempt the nostril piercing so far, there have not been any differences in friendliness or the apparent cleanliness of the place, while each place is double the price of the next. So I wouldn't discourage people from using this location based on the cost.

Overall my experience was satisfactory and my only complaint would be that the website does not reflect the practices of the business.",2
1641,3,1547942400000,"Called in and was put on hold for more than 5 minutes.  Once I placed my order I was told pickup would be between 6:30 and 6:50....it's 4:30! 2 hours for a couple of thin crust pizzas?  Why a twenty minute range for pickup?  I cancelled order so never got to taste the food.  Good news is that the reviews are bad, so it'll slow down enough for me to give it a try very soon.

FYI - your rating on Yelp is the same as Peter Piper Pizza.  Hilarious!",1
1649,2,1547769600000,They close at 8pm not 9pm they place will close earlier sometimes too very sad. I don't know if they don't like kids but we got there at 7:30pm and they said they are closing so Togo orders only. I felt that it was because I had a baby with me sleeping.,2
1650,2,1547856000000,"I'll make this short and sweet. the restaurant is small and has a cute setup. The staff are nice and were attentive. THE PEKING DUCK STEAMED BUN IS TO DIE FOR. The lamb pastrami bun was pretty good too but it's covered in a vinaigrette sauce that's a bit overpowering. the roasted pork ramen wasn't as good as we imagined it to be. the seafood hot pot flavor was amazing as delicious and it did have good portion of fish, but it was lacking broth and the bowls were SO small for a 14 dollar noodle soup dish....  when it got a bit busier, the guys behind the kitchen looked like they were struggling to keep up. there were 5 guys running into each other and looked very disorganized and it took a good hour for our food to come out. I would come back but only for the steamed buns.",2

1680,3,1546560000000,"Maybe I got lucky but my experience at the Plaza Hotel and Casino was pleasantly enjoyable. The parking garage isn't the greatest but it's free for hotel guests (unlike a lot of hotels now). The room rate was cheap so I was expecting the worst but my room was clean, spacious and had a king bed in it. There is also a free shuttle to McCarran Airport, which saves about a $22 Uber ride one way.

My expectations were quite low due to the price and reviews but I would stay there again if I'm on a budget.

FYI: $20.00 resort fee (less than many hotels as well).",2

The bad part about it they know the service sucks, food is mediocre, and the place needs a really good cleaning. I placed a order for sauce and rice and I have to say the sauce was HORRIBLE- COME ON..... That sauce have been around for years other places try but it was a staple at Benihana's you knew you were going to get aleast good sauce but not anymore.

We were very excited to move into Sun Prairie where there was a Glass Nickel Pizza nearby (we previously lived in the Milwaukee area).  The day after we moved in, we decided to order Glass Nickel to eat while unpacking.  The staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time.  Pizza itself was okay, but not NEARLY as good as the New Berlin and West Madison locations.

The next day, we became violently ill.  With the chaos of moving, their pizza was the only thing I ate all day so I'm sure that it was from this.  My husband and I are positive we got food poisoning from their pizza.  We do not plan on re-visiting the Sun Prairie Glass Nickel Pizza (especially after the reviewer stated that employees were cleaning toilets sans washing hands).  Such a shame!!",2

The coffee for my taste, was ok, just not to my tastes. The beer choices looked decent enough to satisfy most.
They have a limited food menu, but I did not try any.

There are tables both inside and out, where you can get some work done. However, My one suggestion with Sip and most other coffee houses, is the lack of outlets. I realize adding outlets can be expensive, so run some cords!",2
1706,3,1547683200000,Back in Vegas in a group of us decided to try Morimoto out. Now upfront it is pricey but you definitely get the bang for your buck. Service was on point and if you don't know what to get the servers can pick it out for you and they definitely gave us a good variety of courses. Best thing yet if it's not to your taste they won't charge you and they will give you something else like good customer service should be. But if you're wanting to broaden your horizons and have a tasting adventure this is the place!,2
1710,1,1546646400000,"I love love love this place for a massage. 
This is the best massage I have ever received and I have had a lot. 

With that said - I like deep tissue really hard massages and I feel like I never get enough pressure. I did not have that issue both times that I have been here. The pressure was perfect and consistent from beginning til end. 

Rochell is amazing as is her partner. I will keep coming back. 

CON - the one and only con is the location.  The room is in a strip mall type location with other businesses next door (literally) and you can hear everything going on inside, outside, and through the entire building. 

If you plan on relaxing or sleeping then this isn't the best location. If you are looking for a damn good massage by people who know what they are doing. This is your place.",2

Today my sandwich was so skimpily made and the ""Dutch crunch"" bread that I have dreamt about since my first visit was not crunchy at all. The manager was only slightly apologetic and when I showed her the small bit of artichoke leaf and that the rest was lettuce she kept insisting it was all artichoke.

She did say their baker has been baking inconsistently lately. I don't know why they would accept inferior product.

She did have the kitchen staff remake the sandwich but it felt extremely uncomfortable.

The second sandwich was tasty, but the overall experience was disappointing.",2

I asked for a corporate number or a higher up and he said ""find it online"" ! I've been in the service industry for 16 years and understand things happen, but to not even give an apology or help with the issue is unacceptable!

I stood at the counter for about 5 minutes before anyone came out from the back. The employee that did take my order definitely did not want to be here. Even though the store is completely empty my smoothie also took a while to finally come out, along with 3 hidden employees I might add. What they are working on besides hiding out in the back is beyond me. 


The smoothie... leaves little to be desired. The smoothie is very watery and doesn't taste fruity at all. Honestly tastes like I'm drinking crushed ice.

1740,2,1546732800000,"Yelp is quite handy in things I need researching on like finding a reputable lash extensions place. Well here I am at Posare Salon located on S. Durango Dr., passed W. Warm Springs Rd. next to Vons/Starbucks on the far left corner of the shopping complex. I'm happy I did my homework! Collette is personable, easy going, and considerate. Texted me in advance, a map pic of where she was and texted me again to let her know when I'm there, so she can open the door for me.  Her room is still being decorated, since she recently moved to this salon location.

I showed her a few pictures of what I was looking for in length and style. I came around a picture that had a purple tint at the ends and I randomly asked her if she can do my lashes this color. To my surprise, she had all sorts of colors and the purple I wanted. I asked her what's her most popular color request and shockingly, not many people ask for it. Maybe perhaps they don't know they could get away with such discreetness in color or all they know is the ordinary black. Well I'm here to tell you.. it's such a mystical charm to have some color to your lashes, especially if you're paying a great amount of money to get them done. The best part of these Purple Ombre Tint Lashes is it's only visible in light. I can even get away with these lashes at work, since it looks so natural :) hehehe hahaha 

You'll feel some poking and tugging at times when the lashes are added, but the whole session took less than 1.5 hours. The fumes did get me good at the end when I opened my eyes, but after it finally dried, my lashes it came out oh so lovely. She gave me this sweet look, which I like, since I can be mean muggin sometimes. I love the hidden color though. I can't rave enough about it. 

Can't wait to get my fill in two weeks and play around with these fun splash of color lashes! Don't be intimidated.. give it a try with Collette. She's superb in her craft. I'm having some Summer fun at Champaigne Lashes. You should too!!! ;)",2

I had used Fantastic Sams way in the past so I decided to give them another try.  Overall a good job.  The barber (I'm sorry I didn't get her name) was really good, always checking to see if what she was doing was right.  And the price is right.

So why only three stars?  I am so sick of business asking for personal information that's not required for the purchase of the product or service I'm  buying, especially if I'm paying with cash.  Smith's doesn't ask for my phone number.  Wal-mart doesn't require my email.  So why do I have to provide my phone number to a barber (I didn't)?  They need a back up system for signing people in who do not wish to provide more than a first name.

We had so much fun and the waitor was very patient. We had a great time, but the food was not so great. Now, we loved the chips and salsa that they bring out, but the other food was bland.

I had the house margarita and I really liked it. Chicken taquitos were ok, but the tacos and sopas my friend got were bland. I also ordered the chicken tortilla soup, I've had better. He food was hot and delivered at the same time, but it was not what we hoped for.

NO ONE rushed us at all from taking our order to answering our 20 questions on the diff meals! They were MOST welcoming and accommodating! The shrimp & chicken salad that we both ordered was SUPER tasty & my mojito was superb!

My favorite thing to get here is their salads. They are always fresh & I love to get the grilled chicken with it. The chicken tenders are good as well because they aren't overly coated with breading & the tenders are juicy.  If I'm craving fish, I like to get the fish & chips.

The burgers can be good....sometimes. They can be a little on the dry side if you order it well done so, that's the chance you take.

As for dessert, I do like their chocolate chip cookies if they don't over cook them. It's happened more than once so, just something to be aware of if you order them.",2

They whisked in and out of her house in minutes and were at my house minutes after that. We moved the piano from the main floor in her home to the main floor in my home so it was pretty straight forward. We both thought they were extremely professional, focused, and quick, as well as reasonably priced. They treated my precious piano with care and also took care to ensure that the door, door jamb, floor and furniture were undisturbed during the move.

I said ""are you sure?"" to the lady when she replied, ""Have a good day"" In my head I was thinking.. wow what a kind lady to give us free ice cream.. then I walked away and sat down with my family.. I told my husband this and he said he would leave some tip just because he wanted to be nice.. As we walk out and my husband places the tip in the tip jar, the lady said to me.. ""oh I still need to ring you up, right?"" I was in shock... on top of that I felt so humiliated, thinking that these scoops of ice cream were on the house... She asked me if the tip my husband left in the jar was the money we were going to use to pay for the ice cream.. I told her no, he wanted to leave tip.. She was gonna ring me up with two kids scoops and a regular scoop.. I corrected her saying two regular scoops and a kids scoop and paid my $9 bill.. I am not the type of person to run out on my bill and I was more than happy to pay in the beginning..

Also has quiet a few Mallish  stores. The food is decent size and has quiet a variety of food options. 
The mall is well kept and has plenty of parking 
Overall a good option to do some shopping in the phoenix area. In my opinion after the  Scottsdale  fashion center, the best option

The classroom section was a bit boring to her as I am sure it would be to any almost 16 year old.  It was required for our insurance discount, and I also felt like it was important because it's been years since I have had to test for my license and I wanted to make sure she was actually getting correct information.  She ended up having friends in the class since most kids seem to go to this school so she was happy about that.  After you take the in class instruction you are eligible for the behind the wheel.  My daughters instructor was Joe Navarro, and he was AMAZING.  Very patient and very thorough.  He came to our home and explained everything to all three of us as far as where they would be going, what they would be working on, and when to expect them back.  He asked if there was anything specific that we wanted him to work with her on, and if there was anything specific that she was unsure of in her driving or that she just needed more practice with.  She had been driving quite a bit with me so I was curious to hear his opinion of her driving.  When they came back 3 hours later he gave me a pretty detailed list (which I appreciated) of the positives, and the things that needed improvement.  Then he gave her some homework that she should do before she takes her driving test 6 weeks away.  One thing he told me as a parent that I really appreciated was the DMV will have them pull out of the lot, and take 4 right turns, then either parallel park or do the 3 point turn.  As a parent you want to be confident that your kid can really master several different driving situations, not just go around the block and park.  I took that to heart because I want to be confident knowing that she really is a good driver before she gets that license.

After a few minutes, they brought out what was about 6x what I had gotten initially and in line with what I had expected from an entree.

1959,3,1548720000000,"Red Lotus is located close to some of my most visited restaurants in Mississauga - Wonton Chai Noodle and Chilli Chicken House. I was in the neighbourhood looking for a late lunch and decided to try something new. If you like spicy food, this is right up your alley! Here are my thoughts:

THE BEST - Spicy Chicken Bamboo is delicious and I highly recommend it. It is really flavourful with a spicy kick. The dish includes red and green peppers, celery, peanuts, green beans and chillies. You might want to order a bowl of steamed rice to help temper the spiciness of the dish. 

NOTEWORTHY - Beef Rolls is a good option but I prefer the Rolled Onion Pancake with Sliced Beef at Asian Legend. They are comparable but the flavours in the latter meld together much more beautifully. 

THE WORST - Dumplings (of any kind). I was intrigued because it specified that they are house-made. They are steamed and to my dismay, it was flavourless. I was curious to know if pan-frying them at home would help the cause. I did bring them home but I should have left them at the restaurant - they were far from being salvageable. 

As for the service, it is subpar in Chinese standards. Each table has a device with options to call the server, request the bill, etc. It was not working. It was hard to get the servers' attention even though it was not very busy. The inattentiveness was not a major issue. I got irritated when I asked the server for a take-out container for the dumplings. She nodded her head and immediately said, ""How would you like to pay? Debit or Cash?"" I incredulously asked her to repeat herself. It was discourteous to say the least.

All in all, I do find their Spicy Chicken Bamboo tasty and unlike anything I've ever tried. Red Lotus is better reserved for take-out than dine-in.",2

Thank you Sparklette's management and route manager, they came back and resolved the issue with the charged cooler to my account, and are in the process of refunding me back the money. It was just a miscommunication and I am happy they were nice enough to make things right. Like I said before I would have gladly stayed with there services getting water every month and now after they resolved this issue I am considering continuing there services. Thank you Sparklette's!!!
 
I was at my apartment one day and got a knock on the door and it was Sparklettes asking if I wanted to start there services, they were offering a good deal for cooler rental and two gallons of water a month, so I did and everything was great up until my lease was ending on my apartment and I was moving.  I called Sparklette's because I wanted to let them know I was moving and that they needed to put me on route at my new apartment complex and also so they wouldn't continue to deliver water to my old address. I was also having issues with the cooler they gave me, the nozzle you pushed down to pour the water wasn't working, no water would dispense from it, so i was paying for the cooler rental and for water I was never ever receiving.  Well after weeks of waiting for them to deliver at my new address no one showed up, I would even see the sparklettes guy come but would never drop off water so I called again and waited and again no water delivered, so I finally closed my account and the next time I saw the sparklettes guy I drive up I flagged him down told them I canceled my services and took the cooler I was renting, so bam I thought everything was done. Well two weeks ago I got a charge for $318.00 automatically taken out of my account from DC Services (Sparklettes) saying that I didn't return the cooler. I am so outraged because I canceled my services, even received a bill from them that I owed a $0.00 balance and than got charged for a cooler they themselves picked up.",1

For a small price, we can ride the rail, stop and get off when you want and then get back on.  Parking is free at the Hilton, so the cost of the rail is all you'll be out.  Then you can beat the traffic jams at the major properties with limited access.",2

The theater was amazing! It had a wall to wall and ceiling to ceiling screen, better sound, a better screen, and better projecter! I also love the food they serve there, they serve kettle corn! 

Tips...
-If your movie is playing in the Cinemark XD theater, watch it there!
-Park at the parking garage or the parking right next to the parking garage, not the Orleans Arena parking.
-Go in the mornings because the tickets can be cheaper, for early bird.
-Get the kettle corn that's there!",3

They make guacamole right at your table and it is delicious. For the main course I order the tacos. Tilapia was delicious as well as the chicken. The tacos came with onions, cilantro, pico and hot salsa (it was so hot I was only able to use maybe a small spoonful, but it was delicious). They even have happy hour specials everyday on different drinks. I will definitely be coming back for more, especially for that guacamole.",3

Unfamiliar places tend do this to me and I'm sure it's a disorder of some sort. So as my eyes adjusted to the dark lit space, I began to admire the wood floors, exposed brick, pulsating light fixtures, and swanky euro furniture. Then my eyes were transfixed on the sparkle behind the bar. Each bottle of booze glistened like fresh cut jewels and was displayed with precise intention to tempt and I wanted them all! Although many of the people sitting at the bar were drinking canned beer PBR to be exact. This is a cool bar and I wanted a cool drink and the choice was a dirty martini. So as we sipped our drinks and moved from one side of the bar to the other and back again admiring every detail. We nodded our heads in approval and  departed delightfully impressed with the outcome of the long awaited Side Bar. A spot we will visit again and again.",2

2015,2,1547856000000,"Hollaaaaaaaaaa (Missy Elliott voice) and Dash right now to this place to get a good biscuit sandwich.  I'm serious.  That is all.

No it's not.  We have more to discuss.  When you open a Biscuit House in ""The South"", we must critique  First, I have a question...H&D, how do you get your Biscuits so fluffy with the perfect amount of density on the inside and golden brown color on the outside without it disintegrating in my hand or getting grease all over my shirt???  Do tell your secret so I can slip the recipe to my grandma and politely tell her to up her game.

Aside from the Biscuits being awesome, so is the food.  I ordered the oats with brown sugar and strawberries.  Pretty sizable portion and made me feel healthy.  Then I dug into Hollerback sandwich, which had some awesome sauce, bacon, fried green tomato and guac.  It was so big that I ate this in two halves and enjoyed it for twice as long.  You get a side with a signature biscuit, so I went with the corn based on the recommendation from the cashier.  She was right.  The flavor was so on point, delicious and refreshing.

This place is pretty casual with a nice outdoor space.  It's a little confusing when they give you a number, and you need to find the small hole in the table to drop in the the number so it stands upright, but the manager came right over to where I was sitting and showed me what to do.

Overall, great fast casual place to grab a filling breakfast or lunch (they serve local Pure Intentions coffee).  Super addition to Southend.  I have no doubt this place will do great.  If anything, they might survive on my business alone.",2

2017,3,1547164800000,"I was attending a play at container park and decided to try cheffinis. It was crowded and my first impression was they did not do well under pressure. The staff were bickering with each other about how to expedite the orders and when to close the coffee shop next door. I placed my order ( 1 naked dog and two kids meals with sliders). After 20 minutes of waiting I was told they didn't have anymore sliders and I could either get my money back or get a hotdog instead. I chose hot dog since I had already waited so long. A few minutes later the cashier came to one of the guys dining and told him he gave him an extra elder by mistake. The guy said, "" I haven't touched it"" and the cashier took it. Another 10 minutes past and I received 1slider which was supposed to have the special sauce. No sauce. I also received the hot dog that was substituted for the slider kids meal I paid for with no fries and no sauce. And a mediocre hot dog. To this day I am praying I didn't receive the side that was retrieved from the guy dining and regret the time and money wasted. I will never return or recommend. Horrible experience.",2
2018,1,1546905600000,"I like!  Here's my take:

PROS:
- Food is great. Is there a better traditional breakfast in Pittsburgh?  I doubt it!
- The breakfast sandwich is my fave. Eggs, spicy sausage, and cheese on Mancini's bread. Just do it. 
- Service is very quick and efficient. Try to run out of coffee. You can't!
- The menu is huge, lots of good stuff to try. 

CONS:
- Its CASH ONLY, and it's now year 2018...  And that's all I can offer on the negative side. 

If you've had this on your list but still haven't tried it, DO IT NOW!  Then write a Yelp review!!!",2

The wait staff was inattentive and rude.  Our waitress was at the end of her shift and made several attempts to take plates while we had food in our mouths.  After she left, other servers kept coming over.  It felt like we were being rushed out, but we still took our time.

I am big fan of Tex-Mex and I really enjoyed the food.  I was looking forward to going here as I have a friend who raves about it.  Unfortunately, the service ruined the experience for me and I would not come back and I don't think I would recommend it to anyone beyond saying food is good, service is awful.",2

There's so many options to choose from; I always have a hard time choosing only 2 options out of all of the salads, soups, and sandwiches. The sandwiches are a little small, so its best to get a sandwich as part of a ""pick 2"" meal. I love the soups. The creme brulee desserts are amazing! Sometimes I come here just for the dessert. My only complaints are that I don't think the chicken is very good quality, and half the time the lettuce in my salad tastes gritty like it was never washed. Ordering can be a little hectic if it's busy, but I generally get my food pretty quickly.",2
2026,3,1548806400000,"Good atmosphere for a snowy Saturday lunch.  

Thumbs up on the extremely rich mac-n-cheese.  My tablemates adored the jalapena hushpuppies(not a big hush puppy fan, so it wouldn't be fair for me to judge).  

Po' boy fish sandwich needs some help.   The fish was lost -- either a 2nd piece of fish or a different sort of bun.  Very tasty fish/batter once deconstructed..

Tablemates enjoyed their lunches.  I was told the chix-n-waffles were as good as Southsides, but with a different spin.  Additional bonus was the fried chicken was boneless.   Wicked good syrup.

EXCELLENT service.

2031,2,1547769600000,"Went to Blue Hound a couple of nights ago for the first time with friends.  The hotel and restaurant had a cool and hip atmosphere.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time and the place was not crowded.  Our server was pleasant and knowledgeable and recommended several things on the menu including the special which was soft shell crab over an artichoke coulis with fiddlehead fern.  I ordered the special (and a shot of gazpacho) and the others at the table ordered a flatbread pizza and tater tots (yum!), the salmon, and the chicken.  When the salmon came out, it was such a tiny portion and my friend commented on it.  I had an option of ordering one or two crabs with my dinner and I opted for one after asking our server if it would be plenty of food.  I should have ordered two.  The food at Blue Hound is creative, ubber fresh, and delicious.  However, we all left still feeling hungry due to the small portion sizes.  We talked about ordering more food but the items are quite pricey and our bill was already over $100 without tip (only two of us had an alcoholic drink).  We eat out frequently at all of the new hip and trendy places that are opening all over Phoenix and feel that with all the other restaurants who are now offering creative farm to table food at  lower prices and larger (yet reasonably sized) portions, Blue Hound has some adjusting to do.  It would be a tough sell to get me to go back unless I knew our bellies would be full and our bill not so high.",2

We stayed maybe 20 minutes including waiting for the cocktail server, waiting at the bar and then sucking down a drink each.

2095,2,1548633600000,"I came here for Spring Training (GO Angels!) with my family. The stadium itself is fabulous. Great size, lots of grass area for the cheaper tickets. Just bring a blanket and sunblock, and you're good to go!

We came earlier than the game start time, so we had an opportunity to tailgate for a bit. The lot appeared to become quite crowded after some time, so I'm not sure that parking is plentiful. The staff were great, and allowed us to drink/eat in the lot. The only problem was that there are NO available restrooms/port-a-potties outside of the stadium. So unless you have an RV with you, you can't drink too much - otherwise, you're not going to have a place to take a leak. 

I did see several men taking trips behind a large cargo bin at the edge of the lot, but certainly no women. My sister-in-law and I had to shmooze some of the TV crew to let us use their own special port-a-potty because there was no other option.

Aside from that ordeal, the stadium is roomy, clean, and sells plenty of food and booze. The views are beautiful, and the vibe is awesome. Looking forward to making this an annual trip!",2
2099,3,1547769600000,"It's been a little hit and miss with this store's employees, but today was a good day.

I've been trying to find an Android phone and my first inclination was to go to T-Mobile since I already had a no-contract phone with them. I wandered into the store last week and talked to a gentleman there who tried to sell me the $79.99 plan (right now, my plan is $39.99.) I didn't want to double my plan just to get some interwebs, so I left.

After a little more research, I found out that T-Mobile actually has cheaper interwebs plans for no-contract phones, which this guy totally neglected to tell me about. He was pretty adamant about getting me into a contract so I could get the $99 price for a phone I was looking at (which, by the way, is FREE if you order online!) 

So, I came into the store this morning as soon as it opened and was greeted by Cynthia, who is the absolute coolest cell phone salesperson I have ever met. She asked what I wanted, I told her, she found it, and she added my $10 data plan and switched my cards (sim and memory) to my new phone, all the while chatting with me about nail salons and Starbucks (and phones, of course.) She answered all my questions and invited me back if I needed anything else, then ever so kindly greeted the next customer as I headed out the door with my new beautiful phone in hand.

My fiancé saw this place and wanted to try it, but we found it out was closed on the weekends. =( My craving for a tasty sandwich/panini lead me to this place finally! I left work early so that I could beat the lunch rush and I definitely beat it. 

I decided to get the Chicken Sandwich (chicken, mixed greens, bacon, tomato, cheddar cheese and pesto) on a panini minus the bacon. The sandwich itself is pretty large which was surprising, because in the pictures it looked smaller. The sandwich was very flavorful and chicken was white meat (my favorite) and tender! All the ingredients paired up perfectly. 

My addiction to chocolate croissants also had me running to this place. Yes, I ordered the pain au chocolat....two of them actually. Although this is not on my diet plan, I had to get them. The crust is very flaky but buttery at the same time. It was pretty dang delicious!

2133,1,1548720000000,"Gourmet hotdogs.. what could that possibly be? My curiosity certainly got the best of me. Tried the Frankathenpolis which was a super long name. What felt like a tongue twister I placed my order as ""the Franka dog"". It is advertised as a gourmet hotdog but if you take out all the unique toppings that they give you the hot dog itself tasted just like any regular street dog

For $7 the hot dog that I ordered came with feta cheese, tomatoes, green olives, diced red + green peppers, olive oil, lemon juice, and my choice of other toppings. I ended up adding hickory sticks, corn, and celery + carrot sticks as well. Yes it's a weird combination but after all it's the Frankathenopolis so may as well go big or go home. You can think of it as a greek fusion hot dog.

There were around 10 types of sauces to choose from. The labels on the bottles were rubbing off so it was somewhat difficult to determine what each of the sauces were. Thankfully the service was great and they were patient with me deciding which sauce to choose from. In the end I settled with mayo and some kind of honey mustard :)

Overall I felt that the meat tasted standard and it was small, but in combination with those toppings I would say it tasted pretty good. It was served in a red plastic basket lined with a sheet of paper that says Fancy Franks. Inside the place is pretty clean. In terms of the seats there are some window seats facing Queen St. W so 
it is always hustling and bustling with people and streetcars. The taste was average and not bad but the hotdog meat could be better. Overall I would say the hotdog itself = 2.5/5 but with the toppings it is 3/5",2

So many people talk about The W like Drake for an example ""I'm at the W but I can't meet you in the lobby"" but this W isn't the same like the rest. The others are bigger and the rooms here just feel cheap. You're paying this high price for a room that's not even the size of a regular bedroom at home. They have LG TV's from like 2007. In this Scottsdale area you shouldn't have anything so cheap especially if your rooms are so expensive for no reason. They give a speaker that connects to IPhone 4's... Like? What? I stayed here randomly and didn't have a tooth brush guess what? They didn't have one either? With this W being in Old Town places with bars and clubs you'd expect them to have these things because a lot people get a room randomly and don't drive home so you should have these things for them. Also there are no balconies just a window that opens again doesn't make any sense. For the price I would say no. If you compared to a motel 6 I would say the motel 6 has probably all the same things this place has. Save your money and find a different hotel.

2161,2,1547337600000,"I think Muddy's review hits the nail on the head. This gym is for getting in, working out, and getting out, and nothing more. It has most of the equipment that you need and it's generally in good repair (recently one piece was broken for over a week--too long in my book). There are some things I'd like to see (squat bar pads that aren't worn out, enough collars for all of the olympic bars -seriously, how much do those cost?!-, a decline bench, better selection of curl bars, etc.), but even with that, it's tough to beat the price. However, given that Golds has basically the same price with many more amenities, they should probably consider addressing some of these issues (including more sanitizer, paper towels, etc.) or they may lose customers. For now, I'll stick with F19.",1
2162,2,1546819200000,"We were visiting Toronto from Upstate NY - had never been there before. When visiting a new city my wife and I do our best to ""live like a local""... and we had a difficult time choosing where to eat as it seems Toronto has just about anything you can think of. But we decided upon Bannock because they were listed as Canadian Cuisine - which is something I'm unfamiliar with. We were not disappointed, whatsoever. The food was delicious. The atmosphere was intimate, and kinda trendy. The service was wonderful. The price was very reasonable... we spent $100 for two dinners, desserts, and drinks. Try the Bannock Bannock - the smoked salmon was perfect.",2
2163,1,1547424000000,"Oh jamba... first of all some background. I have been coming to this locations for 10 years. As a 23 year old that is a big deal for me. I have never had a company that provided a product consistently at a reasonable price other than jamba juice, so i thought. My sister worked here for 2 years and i am friends with a handful of now previous employees. The customer service is horrific, when i walk in and ask for the order that i called in, if you dont hear me you could simply ask ""Excuse me sir i missed what you had said"" instead i got ""WHAT?!"" Now i get it with the blenders running it can get pretty noisy, and had i been an elderly person whom may have a hard time hearing i could understand you yelling at me. However i am very obviously a young man with great listening abilities and would've heard yoh no problem had you just repeated yourself in the same tone. Not that you knew this but i work in a professional kitchen and am very skilled in tuning out background noise to communicate. As for the next part this is what really set me off and decide to never come back. I called in my order because i was on my way to work and assumed that if i called my order in i would be in and out. Instead after moving past the fact that im paying to be treated like on of your home girls, i stand at the juice pick up waiting for nearly ten minutes watching 3 girls continue workiing around me.  I was the only customer in the building and you could easily finish the dishes after i leave a satisfied customer. However i stood there waiting for a drink that i knew was already made sitting in the cooler as the person making the drinks wiped down her station. I had to go back to the register to find the girl that checked me out on her phone and when she was done she looked up at me and i had to ask if my drink was ready or if they needed to make it. Ever since Haley Hinds left the management has been on an exponential decline. At least when Stephanie Hasse worked there the other employees worked their butts off because fore mentioned employees created an enviroment of almost retail proportion. As an employee you should be in my face helping me or communicating with me to ensure that i come and go a satisfied customer. Instead you will probably read this and say.... ""WHAT?!""",2
2165,2,1548892800000,"I was away from my typical neighborhood stomping grounds when I suddenly had a craving for fried chicken. I found this spot, Soul Foo Young and just had to try it - Chinese food and Southern food - together!

I walked into the bar, went to the order window and dinged the bell. Georgia came to the window and started up on telling me all about the food she was serving that day, she is so nice and clearly cooks with southern love. I went for the Bruce Leroy special - which is from the movie  ""The Last Dragon"" from the 80's. I used to watch that movie all the time! The Bruce Leroy consists of 3 southern style fried chicken wings with Chinese fried rice. 

The food is cooked to order - and good fried chicken takes at least 15 minutes. So it is fresh, it just takes a little while. When it did finally come out, it was soo tasty. The Chinese fried rice really goes well with southern fried chicken which was crunchy and well seasoned. Her fried chicken took me back to the time I visited Jackson, Mississippi. So yummy. Next time I would like to try her chicken smothered in gravy, egg foo young, and collard greens - since I have to get my veggies in somehow.

One of the things about this spot is that it inside the Double Diamond Bar and because it is a bar, next time I would definitely order ahead for take out - unfortunately eating at the smoky bar can take away from the yummy food Georgia is serving up.

Call ahead, ask Georgia for recommendations, and order for take out!",1
2168,2,1547078400000,Service was horrible!! Restaurant was VERY dirty! I eat here 5-6 times a month... different one over the valley.... this has been the worst! :(,2
2170,3,1547164800000,Customer service here was horrible. You would think you'd help the customers that are in line to give you money before stocking the shelves. Nothing was priced. I asked for a pin the tail of the donkey game for kids and they couldn't fine it and then the employee just walked away. The girl that filled my balloons was so rude. She didn't even tie them right and made it seem like I'm inconvenienceing her by purchasing balloons at a party store. Bad vibe at this place. Stay away.,2
2174,1,1548201600000,I would post a picture of the food but it's too late! Visiting Cleveland for the night and decided to come here because they have a nice patio and allow pups!! It turned out that their food was delicious too! My fiancé ordered the classic old fashion and I got the French 65. Both were delicious and boozy! For food we got a bunch of snacks to share. Our favorites include the confit wings (they are amazing and way better than any other wings you have had!) and the Brussels sprouts were delicious! Would definitely come back!  The only negative I would have is that it is located in a fairly congested and touristy street. But well worth the visit!,2
2174,2,1546300800000,"While a single visit is not enough to justify an excellent or terrible rating, I was impressed with my recent encounter here. My dog had become very sick in a short amount of time and I called several vets who had no opening until later that afternoon. Crossroads was able to get me in right away and they were very helpful and thorough. The vet tech/front office employee was obviously very busy but she stayed polite and professional the entire time.

The doctor did not simply tell me what he was going to do, but he discussed the options with me and let me decide on the care that my dog received based on price and desired level of care. They were very efficient; it took less than thirty minutes from the time I arrived until my dog was treated and we were out the door. The price that I paid for this care was reasonable, even less than I was expecting. I am grateful that they were able to help us so quickly and thoroughly.",2

2176,1,1547942400000,"I have been waiting a while to write this review because I was torn. I am always on the hunt for farm fresh, healthy food. I find that the west valley is seriously lacking in this type of cuisine. I think it is a great idea to bring this here, and if it was done right, it would be successful. For example, Paradise and Jasons deli are always packed. Also a Wildflower bread is on its way, and I think it will do well. 
I think Field Kitchen would have done a lot better if it was opened in its own location, and not taking out a crowd favorite of Sweet tomatoes. There are many loyal sweet tomatoes customers who are upset about the change. Try this in an empty building, don't take peoples favorite thing away. This building was not designed for their new concept and just trying to fit it in the cheapest way possible. The flow and feel of a restaurant is very important. It sets the whole foundation for the experience. The flow here is off like many reviewers have pointed out. What was a good idea, had poor execution. 
Anyways, we went to this on the opening day. I was excited but wary because of the change and the increase in prices. Again, I would have been a lot more excited if it wasnt at the expense of the normal sweet tomatoes and at a separate place. But being the food adventurer and wanting something healthy, we wanted to give it a shot. The first thing my husband noticed was the change of staff. There were a lot of hipster young kids. I am not sure where they came from, maybe somewhere in the east valley. I guess they are trying to market towards a younger edgier crowd than the traditional patrons. We went through the same spiel as the others when we sat down. It was a confusing concept but we got it. I am not a fan of confusing concepts but they dont break it for me. For example, I still love Paradise even though the different stations are a little confusing too but maybe because I was introduced to Panera first and they have a better flow. 
Anyways, my parents went first. My dad is hard of hearing, and I don't think he got it, and he got frustrated and just ended up with a bowl of chili and did not want to go back to get something else. So he was pretty hungry by the end. My mom ordered one of the gourmet salads. She was very disappointed. She ordered a chef salad, and there was barely anything on it. I think they missed half of the ingredients, and put some flaccid meat on it. It was a terrible looking sad face salad.
Next, we went up. I wanted to try one of their gourmet salads. The salad maker was so excited that I wanted to try one because not many people were, but then I asked if soup and stuff were included and was told No. Um, what? I am paying a premium price for this salad and I can't hit the soup bar? That is messed up to me, especially since you order in the same line. So I cancelled that, and got the soup and salad bar.
My salad was good. I can't think of any topping I was missing. I did miss the premade salads like the asiago cesear and coleslaws. I got the the dressing spinner, and picked out a dressing. I didnt like that the dressing went all over the bowl, I had some things that I did not want dressing on. It was annoying, and I mean seriously, paying someone to do that is a waste. 
Then,  I got to the 3 soup choices. I was thoroughly disappointed that I could have soup or macaroni and cheese.  
I also did not like that it wasn't all you can eat. Most salad bars are all you can eat. That is the appeal of having to make your own salad, so you can try different things. Jason's deli has a small salad bar, but its delicious and you can go back. What are they doing differently that Field Kitchen cant do? 
The bread station was good. I didnt taste any difference in the butters. It seemed like a marketing trick to think you are getting gourmet butter, but there is really nothing different or special.
We didn't bother with the yogurt. Our experience was just lacking that we wanted to get out of there.
Its sad. I think that it was a poor execution to try and get more money out of their customers and they took a crowd favorite out. Now we will never have a sweet tomatoes by us. 
We have gone to the metrocenter one a few times, but not to the extent we were frequenting the Arrowhead location. 

Will we be back? Probably not, I will just go to Jason's Deli, Paradise, or Wildflower.",1

Ordered the Kokoro combo 4 which is a combo of spicy salmon rolls and dynamite roll. It didn't taste fresh at all. The salmon was ok, nothing great but the dynamite was horrible. The tempura shrimp and sweet potato in the roll tasted like it was made days prior and was cold with a rancid oily taste. The avocado in the roll was already super brown when I opened the 'made to order' box of rolls. The rice was ice cold and unappetizing. Plus they didn't provide the good Japanese soya sauce, just the Chinese kind that's super salty and not for rolls. 

Won't come back.",1

The food is like a basic breakfast menu but all with a twist. Each dish is really flavorful, wished i tried their infamous pancakes  

The decor is soo nice i even got out a good instapic of it. Definitely a place to hit up with ur gal friends !",3
2230,2,1546560000000,"The food was hit-n-miss but on the whole good. The service was nice but she seemed distracted most of the time. The noise and lack of privacy were unacceptable.

The prosciutto with dates appetizer was good but there was nothing to it. It was exactly just the ingredients, a little bit of prosciutto and 3 dates. There's no reason to order it again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because you could easily make it at home.

The warm beet salad was excellent. The farmers salad however did not fit the meal or the season. It was light and citrusy, it would be excellent for a warm summer evening, or light spring lunch at a cafe, not a cold February evening at a steakhouse

The lamb was good, just good. The filet was excellent but did not need the sauce added. It was very tender for grass-fed beef.  The beef was served with some melt in your mouth baby potatoes that were excellent.  We ordered mushrooms as a side and they were not good.  This was especially noticable because the mushrooms at Red's (Litchfield's predecessor) were simply amazing. 

The creme brule and creme with berries deserts were just ok.  The creme brule was over powered by the marmalade on it.  The creme with berries had some sort of cake or bread at the bottom that was supposed to be soaked in grand marnier but only half of it was, the other half was hard and not good.

We did not enjoy the proximity of other tables and the amount of noise from all the close tables packed into the dining room.  Adding to the din was the kitchen, located in the dining room with all the banging and clattering, it was hard to enjoy a quiet conversation.  

It's the best we'll find in the SW valley but no one should drive out just for this restaurant.  In the end the quality of the main courses and the salads saved the restaurant. so A-Ok.",2

Our waiter was terrific, took time with us, and talked about the recipies and the different items on the menu.  Since we were so curious, the Chef also stopped by to explain the food came from the Gulf area of Mexico.  Salsa smokey, drinks were excellent, and the flan was different from what we get in LA.  

If we were not leaving the next day, we would have gone back.  If you are heading down to Freemont Street, or if you are looking for an excellent meal, go to La Comida.  I think you will enjoy it.

Since I am from Southern California we decided to check some dealers there that would offer some deals.  We did find a Maserati we liked in California but it sold before we could talk money.   Went back to Wynn and met with  sales Mike Shiffman.  Well, he went above and beyond to  help us find the Maserati we would be happy with at an incredible price.  There were some challenges but Mike went to bat for us and we ending up driving away with a  new Maserati.  The follow up to make sure we were enjoying our car has been incredible.

I had been looking for a good sports bra in addition to some pretty bras because I have had a bit of trouble finding my size. I happened to show up at the store at around 5:40pm and they close at 6pm. Keep in mind, I didn't know what time they closed and I didn't even know the name of the store because my husband forgot to write it down. I knew where to go because of it's location. As soon as I walked in I saw the ""what the heck?"" face from the sales person, yeah- I'm calling you a sales person not a bra fitter consultant, because your job is to sell. Anyhow- she was pretty rude off the bat and let me know that they were closing at 6pm and that she would ""try"" her best in finding me what I needed. She put me in the room, measured me and went to grab 3 bras and none of them fit. As soon at the clock was close to six she was literally trying to get me out of there. She said she couldn't find anything my size and that she would call me. I pointed to her a bra color I would also like for her to look into for me and she was very quick to respond that the bra I was looking at was for women that underwent mastectomy's. I wasn't asking for that bra! I was telling her I wanted that color. Anyway- guess what? It's been 2 weeks and I'm still waiting on that call. It's sad for the business owners because they leave their business in the hands of people that don't really care about customer service or to actually sell. I'm never going back there again.",2

I love bacon but my Benedict was overwhelmed with bacon. The bacon was extremely well cooked, thick strips that were more hard than crispy and quite salty. There were also bacon bits on top of the tasteless hollandaise. The bits were equally hard and salty. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked with runny yolks and the avocado was, well avocado. This was the first time bacon actually ruined a meal for me. The shredded hash browns were still soggy and white and could have used a few more minutes to brown. The other dishes also looked uninspired. As for the decor, lots of distressed and reclaimed wood with unique works of art. Some of the distressed wood like the floorboards looked more like a product of lack of maintenance than intentional.

2290,1,1546560000000,"Thank you Phoenix Yelpers for leading me to this awesome place! What did we do before Yelp was born?! 

My family and I decided to road trip to Phoenix for the new year. Since we have never been, it sounded like a fun idea. We were staying off of Camelback Rd, which appears to be a popular place for most of the cool places we found. I Yelped some restaurants and even though we were looking for Thai, I was excited to try Cambodian. My husband and I honeymooned in Thailand almost 5 years ago and I have heard the food is similar.

We trekked out to the place and upon arrival, we were leery of the location, but from experience, I know that most of the best ethnic foods are found off the beaten path. I kinda dig that, but in a new city...you don't really know where you are. Putting that aside, we walked into Sekong by Night and were greeted by two dining hipsters. They were so nice and just randomly decided to say hello as we entered. I like it already!

The place was set up with cool picnic-style tables and the front had some Cambodian furniture and decorative items. I like the authentic look of this place. The tables had books about Cambodia on them, so you could get educated while you waited. The young waited greeted us promptly. He was a friendly guy and was always there when you needed something.

I ordered the Red Curry, since there weren't a lot of vegetarian options. There were 6 items that could be made vegetarian. We also got some jasmine tea. I have to say, I have had many red curries, from many places and this one was one of the best! It was bringing back flavors from Chiang Mai, which was one of our stops in Thailand. I seemed to recall the food being this good there and I was happy to consume again!

I wish we had this place in San Diego! Go to Sekong by Night if you live in Phoenix! Even if you are visiting...go! You will be pleasantly surprised and so will your taste buds! It made me want to travel again!",2

The good
- drinks specials
- central location to financjal district
- dead so you'll get a seat

The bad
-washrooms are not the nicest
- crowd is so so
- Food looked only ok
- drinks cheap but wine but pricy
-overall place uppity for what it was

They asked me a few questions about my pest problem (scorpions) in particular, showed a great deal,of concern, and set me up for an appointment at my convenience(nice). They told me who would be here and what to expect. My technician, Brandon, was prompt and courteous, and told me what he was going to do, what chemicals he was using, and any precautions I might want to observe, if any, around those chemicals. He treated the inside of the house, the outside, the perimeter, pretty much every square inch of the property. 
He then came back and told me what he found and what to expect to see over the next few days.

That really should've been my first clue.

After two visits over the course of two days where I found out the pool was less than spectacular and a number of their cardio machines need maintenance, I decided I was fed up and took advantage of the cancellation window and thought that would be the end of it. Of course, it wasn't and I got a lovely surprise this morning when I discovered that, despite cancelling within three days, they still withdrew the $30. Classy.

The one bright side of this entire mess is that I'm supposed to be refunded my $30 in 7-10 days, so here's to hoping that will actually happen.",2

My boyfriend and I shared the scallops, ribeye and Hakka noodles. The portion sizes were large and my favorite part was the scallops but once again nothing super special.

We barely made it to happy hour in the vino lounge, but the server was very friendly and even gave us a last call 5 minutes before 7PM so we could order a second round.  for $45 we shared 4 glasses of wine and 5 tapas, which ended up being the perfect sized meal for two girls who'd just eaten about a pound of chocolate. (see seven sisters review!) 

the yucca frites with argentinian chimmi churri were a highlight for us. much denser than potato fries, they had a creamier texture and the chimmi churri was delicious.  we also tried 3 different cheeses all of which were excellent, and the eggplant cannelloni which was good but nothing to write home about. 

the wine lounge is an outdoor deck draped with white curtains and white couches and ottomans, it is very chic but unpretentious and we had a great time! there wasn't a crowd of people outside, which was nice, but of course it was only a wednesday evening.  we hung out until 9ish then walked around the strip mall before heading out.

I go here every time I visit- which is almost bi-monthly. My family has become friends with the waiters we go there so much. Make sure you have a reservation- else you are not eating trust me. 

The food is ROCKIN'! I have tried almost everything, it is ALL AMAZING. It's hard to believe food can taste so good.

Appetizers:Tiger Shrimp and Roasted Corn Tamale, 
Blue Corn Pancake

Dinner: Pork Tenderloin (best in the world), Grilled Mahi Mahi

They used to have tiger shrimp blue corn nachos, but I think they took them off the menu. It is worth special-requesting this appetizer. They might make it for you. Homemade tortilla chips Bobby Flay style. Can you even imagine?",2

We went to this store, received nothing but attitude from the associate, Bianca when we were trading our phones in for the $200 credit we were promised by the GM himself. This credit was part of a promo given when we renewed our contract two weeks before, which we completed with the GM. We came back two weeks later to get our iPhones that were out of stock the first time we went in. Instead, she wanted to give us $38 (where that number was from, couldn't be answered from her either) for our trade. After telling her, her own boss promised us the full $200, she said that we were wrong. We asked to speak to someone else, she refused. We confronted another assoiate and told him that she said $38 and he even disagreed with her. We asked to speak to her manager, then magically she came back stated that her manager on duty would override and give us the $200 credit.

2381,2,1546905600000,"We had a good experience. I met up with some friends and we split three dishes family style. Unfortunately, I arrived after my friends ordered so I'm not sure what each dish was called.

The building can be easy to miss but there is plenty of parking, which is nice. The restaurant is tastefully decorated and the service, while a little slow at times, is still pretty good. I liked that our server explained what each dish was and how to eat it; I'm new to Cambodian food so his explanations were really helpful.

We had a beef noodle dish, which was really tasty. I like the texture of the noodles and the beef had a wonderful flavor. We also had a beef dish with a sour, crunchy sauce, raw vegetables, and rice. The beef was good, and the sauce was very interesting. Our last dish was fish - really great flavor. Again, I didn't see the menu so I can't list the names of the dishes - sorry! :(

I did feel the portions were a little small for the price, but I do realize that the ingredients are probably expensive to purchase in Phoenix, so I can understand the justification for the price. It wasn't outrageously expensive, so I was fine with the final cost of our meal. Overall, very nice food and very cute restaurant.

I would have given this restaurant 4 stars but I decided to only give 3. I love Yelp, and I depend on reviews, good and bad, to help guide my decisions. I do agree that the customer is not always right, but I think the high and low ratings for this restaurant are fair because everyone has a different experience, palate, expectations, etc. I'm fine with the owner defending the restaurant against poor reviews, but many of his replies mock the customer, contain rude language, and just leave a bad impression. I think both owners and customers have a duty to treat one another with respect, which I don't see here.

I am all for supporting local businesses, and I would love to come back, but I'm honestly not sure I will. I am curious to see what scathing reply the owner will leave to this review (if any).",2

We ordered their:
Tokyo Scallion (salt) - quite good
okra (salt) - it was ok, but might be better with ""tare"" instead
chicken tail (tare) - very good and nicely charred
chicken skin (salt) - it was ok, wish it was charred more, so crispier and less chewy
chicken thigh with scallion (salt) - juicy thigh and sweet scallions
chicken wing (salt) - crspy exterior and juicy interior (wished it came with 2 wings)
jalapeño tsukune (salt) - juicy but bland :(
cheese tsukune (tare) - juicy and much tastier compare to jalapeño tsukune
wagyu beef (salt and wasabi) - juicy and nicely charred but lacking beef taste
yakionigiri (konbu kelp) - the best of the night, the exterior is nicely charred like the ones you get from clay pot rice, while the interior was still pillowy soft and tasty

They had some great choices for wine but all three of the entrees we ordered were dull and flavorless.  We ordered the zucchini appetizer which was nothing exciting.

No doubt in my mind that Baguette probably had some fine sandwiches, quiches and the like, but I severely doubted that it was worth a trek from UNLV or my house in the Southeast to experience.  If I could turn back time to September of 2009 I would most certainly be Duke of this joint raising my Yelp cred.  Unfortunately I don't have time travel abilities and am stuck with a paltry 8 check-ins here and non-elite status for '16 which I wear with Scarlet Letter-like shame.  

The food here is really on point.   I especially am in love with most of the salads they offer.  In particular the Ham, Prosciutto and Tuna varieties just blow me away every time.   In perusing the reviews I saw a random 1 star review which made me pause, and saw the reviewer complaining about the length of time it took for his salad, and wondering why (I'm paraphrasing) ""it took so long to throw some meat and greens together"".   I, for one, am happy that it's not that simple for the staff here to lovingly put together what very well might be the best salads in Las Vegas that I've had.  I've actually stood, drink in hand, watching them prepare my salad-to-go order (yes, that's just as creepy as it sounds), and there's a lot of attention to detail and, dare I say, culinary love going into these.  All of the ingredients, from the meats, cheeses, veggies and herbs always taste fresh and no component seems out of place or unneeded.  

I can only put the highest of recommendations on those three salads, as I tried the chicken salad once, as well as the greek salad with chicken, and found the chicken to be bland in comparison to the other protein options.  

I haven't really delved into the sandwich options much as the salads demand my attention every time.  Preferring salads to sandwiches is something I would've once only thought a Bizarro version of myself would say.   That's the power of Baguette Cafe.",2

It turns out they had no recollection or proof of any double charge because it was made erroneously and then quickly refunded.

I can't say it wasn't annoying to have to run around and call and go to my bank etc. But i am so happy to see that they did what was correct. I added a star because I couldn't make it a 3.5...

I wholeheartedly regret that decision after coming here during my burger binge week visit!! They were offering the Smokehouse burger for $5 for the Yelp GTA Burger Week, and at an original price of $13.50 it was such a goood deeaaaal. It had caramelized onions, peppercorn sauce and smoked cheddar. For me the peppercorn sauce was the star of the burger. So flavourful without being overpowering or salty, the sauce really brought the whole burger together for me. I also really like the fresh veggies in the burger for the simple fact that they actually tasted really fresh and made me feel less guilty about the state of my narrowing arteries. The buns were also awesome and did not dissolve into messy oblivion with the peppercorn sauce!

The #bestbossever also treated me to some sweet potato fries to share and THEY WERE THE BOMB! Sooooo crispy on the outside, and the sauce that came with it also had the perfect kick of cinnamon and spice to compliment the taste of the sweet potato.

2577,1,1546387200000,"One of my faves in Madison! The menu resembles a lot of Thai dishes and for the most part tastes very similar. I've eaten here so many times I can't even keep track. They are pretty timely with the take-out and the portions are always generous. 

Dishes I would recommend: 
1) The mango curry dish with chicken. So goooooood. It's sweet almost like a dessert but it is savory and delicious. I always get it ""native lao"" spice but I have a pretty high tolerance for spice so I would not recommend this for everyone.
2) Tom Yum soup, the flavor is great, some of the best I've ever had. It's got chili paste, mushrooms and lemongrass in it. 
3) Khua Mee, resembles a pad thai, basically rice noodles with tamarind,eggs, brocolli, bean sprouts and topped with peanuts. I am a huge fan of rice noodle stir fries so this one tops my list. 

This location is pretty small and intimate but I think that adds to the charm of this place. Not a great place for large groups but I hear the location on Atwood is a lot larger. I haven't tried any of their speciality dishes yet but I'm sure I'll be making another stop here soon.",2

Should have written a review from my first visit several years ago, it would have been better. 
We liked it so much the first time that we planned on eating there when we went down to Boulder City.

 We stopped in at dinner time and only a few people were seated outside. 
We ordered an antipasto salad, spaghetti & meatballs and a small cheese pizza. 

The salad came out first, it was some cold cuts and cheese sliced in strips on top of iceberg lettuce that had seen better days, tomatoes were mushy from being cut early that morning, lots of ripe olives, banana peppers and oregano. Not too appealing to the eye and I've had better. Silverware would also be nice instead of plastic forks, if you're paying almost 9 bucks for a salad, it would be better not to eat with plastic

The spaghetti came with one meatball. The meatball was very flavorful, wish there was more.. The sauce was also very flavorful and thick.

The pizza, although again not eye appealing the crust with the sauce did have great flavor.. If you like tomatoes, you're going to like the sauce. The cheese kept sliding off but it was good & chewy. 

Eating outside was nice, no atmosphere inside, and appeared that it needs a good cleaning.

The leasing office staff is always helpful, happy, and accommodating to me and my family. The area around elevations is filled with locally known family owned restaurants, ice cream shops, and coffee shops. Lastly, and for most important i always feel safe in my apartment as well as in the parking garage area while walking to my place. All I can say is that I am beyond happy that I chose to live here! if you decide on elevation on central you won't be disappointed!



update!!!!
July 7th, 2017

i am updating my review because much has changed here at elevations after graystar sold to pillars. the management team is MUCH different than when i moved in, not for the better. i was not concerned with safety at all when i first moved in because i had never run into anyone or anything shady and things seemed to be secure. however, when i came into the building about 3 months ago and their was a poster posted on the doors notifying residents of an assault on property i was shocked! apparently, the intruder came in through a breeched exterior door. since then i have obviously been a lot more cautious and alert. the most recent scare happened about 4 weeks ago when my fiancé and i were approached in the parking garage by a man yelling at us to let him in the building. i hated to be the apartment  police, but we didn't feel comfortable letting him in knowing that if he did really live here like he said he did, then he would know to go down to the leasing office and get a new key. it just didn't seem right so we told him we were sorry and to go down to the leasing office which he was NOT HAPPY about. we then got cussed at and flipped off as we exiting the parking garage and all the out onto highland as we tried to make a left onto camelback. i could not believe we were being verbally accosted in our own living space that we pay high dollar for. i then called elevations to let them know what had happened just in case the person was planning on repatriating and they didn't seem to care. after reading some of the other reviews, i cant help but to agree. it is really sad to read my previous review when i first moved in and see how i was obviously happy here. you would think pillars would care enough to fix the wrongs and help keep their residents feel safe and happy here. in the end, we are the ones who keep their units rented, yet they don't seem to care.




UPDATE! august 14th, 2017

after taking about a month to tour and look around at the latest and greatest apartments in the central and downtown phoenix area, it became very clear that for the price, square footage, location, and amenities, elevations is definitely the best bang for your buck in this area. the more toward scottsdale you go, the more $$ you will pay for less. I know that in my last review i was very disappointed in the level of security at elevations, however, since touring many other communities and making security one of my main questions, it appears that every other community has the same level of security if not less than elevations has to offer. 
as far as square footage for base rent, elevations has the best deal including a private parking space that is no extra charge. I looked and looked long and hard trying to find something better but, truth being told, i couldn't justify all of the headaches of moving for something not significantly better. 
long story short, i have decided to stay at elevations and since then i feel great about my choice and could not be happier here! after lowering my stars to 3 star, i am bringing it back up to 4 star now. no community is perfect, but elevations is very good for price & location!",3

The moves- JLO danced during the entire performance. No wonder she's in great shape! 

The voice- I don't recall her voice being as beautiful as when I saw her live. I think it's gotten better over time. 

The costumes: When Vegas meets JLo, you'll get sexy, sparkly, colorful outfits from head to toe... although some outfits barely cover anything at all!

The set: The stage, sound, lighting, and production were beautiful and flawless... It looked like there were a couple million bucks flying around making every song feel more magical and making JLo look hotter than ever. 

Our seats were $200 and were worth every penny. She sang all her hits, not in chronological order, but according to her different styles. She went from Brooklyn street swag to Puerto Rican Diva, to beautiful mother of her two Coconuts. I loved every minute of it, especially because photography was allowed!

However, I guess with the new job's dress code, it's become too casual for me. Even the dress clothes that the Gap carries looks more like something more suitable for a club in my opinion. And for the young too, which I'm not anymore. 

Anyway - it's ok for casual clothes I guess when I can find stuff that isn't for the skinny or slim fit kind of guys. I like my clothes comfortable, which means not fitted and it's getting hard to find them for me these days.

I was excited when I saw it first opened and couldn't wait to try this east coast staple. We ordered the Smoke Shack burger, Shack-cago dog, cheese fries and a drink. This all came out to about $20. 

Pros: the fries. Omg the fries. I would come back for the cheese fries alone. The burger and hot dog were also both pretty good as well. But the fries were the standout for me. 

Cons: we came on a Friday night around 6:30pm and they only had 2 out of the 3 registers open so we had to wait in line for quite some time before ordering. 
Next would have to be the size and pricing of the food. I was shocked when we picked up our dinner at how small the portions were.  Like I said, the food was good but if I'm going to pay $20 for cheeseburgers and hot dogs dinner I would at least like to get my money's worth. We were hungry again by the time we got home. :(

I get it, and have no problem with it, IF, the service and product remains consistent. For instance, you used to get all drummies when you ordered wings, now you get a mix and only 10. They've started using chips and now up-charge for waffle fries. The quality in the food product continues to decline while demanding more from the consumer. 

I made a to go order and after driving 20 minutes to get it and get back home I find that it's wrong (wrong type of wings) and one of the items was horribly made. I called and commented on the experience and although they reversed the charges (what they should do) I have decided that there are too many options with more consistency and care for the client.

2751,1,1548633600000,"Salty Seniorita is an old town institution. I have spent many spring training afternoons and mornings at Salty's. It has been a favorite of my friends and family and we've developed an affinity for their friendly service, good drinks and great food. However, over the last few years, the service and attention to detail has deteriorated to an extent that I won't be taking my business here any longer. With so many new options in old town that actually provide some level of competent service (including RnR across the street), it doesn't even make sense. 

Yesterday, my party and I were seated after a 15 minute wait (not bad for a spring training afternoon) but the service was just terrible on so many levels. We started with two orders of the bacon guacamole which the waiter said would ""be right out""'after a 20 minute wait. They turned out to take 20 more minutes. When we finally placed our food orders and 45 minutes had passed, the waiter came to ask us how we'd like to split the check BEFORE we even had the food on our table. Truly egregious. We had an outdoor table and it was kind of ironic to look across the street and wonder how much better the meal would have been at RnR. Again, the waiter and restaurant had clearly failed any measurable service standard and instead of trying to make amends, he simply tried to accelerate shuffling us out of the restaurant. Unacceptable way to treat long time customers. 

The food did eventually show up and as always, the tacos did impress. Salty's still does a great job with the food. So my advice: if you want great Mexican food with terrible service, Salty's is your spot. But if you want decent food with some actual service--there's 30 other options in old town alone. Bring back the old Salty's atmosphere!",2

It has a lot to do with the customers attitude as well. Customer service can be tough, people can be ruthless with their down right ugly attitudes.... Over donuts????#wtf...

The selection was small and it was often difficult to get at the food because it was not set up in the tradition buffet style. It was more like a cafeteria. The pasta section had a chef that would make you whatever you ordered. I ordered some pasta which ended up tasting like the pan he cooked it in.

When the server came back she was incredibly arrogant and impatient with taking orders. 

The bar staff was no better and made us wait for another half hour because they apparently ran out of glasses. Given the fact that the restaurant was barely at half capacity for a Saturday night, I think the overall operations of this restaurant need a huge overhaul.

I walked in before class to grab a quick snack. I ordered two siopao (pork buns) and a mango juice. The service was really quick. And I got everything within minutes. The siopao came with a bit of the pork gravy to dip it in. Oh man, it was drippy, sticky and oh so good. It made me miss my mommy's cooking.

Food: 
We ordered the ""Big Red Po"" tea which is not usually offered at other dim sum places which was nice.  I like this tea flavor a lot.  The dim sum menu selection is average but the quality is nice.  Dishes were unique and the taste was wonderful.  See pic for some of the unique items that I enjoyed.  For savory dishes, I especially enjoyed their seafood pancake and sticky rice. For the sweet dishes, the dumpling was very unique sitting in a tart with a pineapple bun on the top.  The pink leaf wrapped dessert tasted as great as it looks.  The Napoleon cake was huge.  It looked nice but I wouldn't order it again.   

Service:

If you want to try on the cheap, look out for their LivingSocial deals, which I don't understand as it's already pretty popular.

2871,3,1548288000000,"Asian King is OK. I've been here a couple of times, for family dinners and such. I like their sweet and sour pork (or chicken) a lot! I've been to many chinese restaurants, and I find that Asian King is my favourite place for this specific dish. They use really good quality meat cuts in there, and the sauce is just right... not too sour or sweet.

The fried rice however, always comes unevenly seasoned... It's really weird. Sometimes I get a spoonful of rice in my mouth that's super salty, and then another spoon that is bland. This happens every time I order fried rice here... Not too happy about that... I've had their lunch menus and they're good value/affordable. It comes with corn soup, I've never had this type of soup before. It was alright.

I find that everything else on the regular menu is pricier. Especially their dimsum...main reason why I haven't tried their dimsum.

The comments about the servers careless service is consistent with all of my visits there. It takes a while before they get on with what I ask for... like asking for another bowl of rice. I also get the feeling that they dislike Canto-speaking customers... They usually give me a blank face or irritated face... I have yet to see a smile when they serve me.",1

Told my sister about it... we went there... she also yelped on the same matter... Pho was warm, almost luke-warm when we got it.  Basil didn't wilt in the soup.  Not a good thing at all.  Service was slow, but as expected as it's family owned and the place was full. There is somewhat of a language barrier with ordering...  for the most part...MOST of the order came out right... but we had to ask for alot of things that should've just been done already.  So, I have to give this place 3 stars.. 1st time there..PHO was hot.  2nd time there PHO was not.

2876,1,1547596800000,"I'm basing this review on the happy hour menu. We had a team outing here last night and decided to check this place out. We hadn't initially anticipated doing happy hour, but since we got here before the 6pm cutoff, we decided to order a majority of our meal off the menu. They have plenty of appetizers, drinks and rolls for $5 or less on the menu. We ordered a number of different things to share. I started with a Strawberry Bangkok to drink. It was pretty refreshing, nothing amazing, but good for the price. Here is a rundown of what we ate. 

Hamachi kama - Not the best yellowtail collar I've ever had, but it was a nice size portion and at only $5 I can't complain. 

Shishito peppers - A little oversauced, but the flavor was nice nonetheless. 

Candy cane roll - My favorite of the night. Flavorful and refreshing. I'd definitely order this again, despite it not being on the happy hour menu. 

777 roll - Not a fan, despite the $5 pricetag. The flavors were just off and I probably wouldn't order it again. 

Squid legs - Chewy and overcooked. Really not a fan, wouldn't recommend. 

Salmon poke - This dish was just ok, although there was a little too much sauce and it was a little vinegary. 

Eggplant fries - Second favorite dish of the night. I'm not really a fan of deep-fried food but this was light for fries. The eggplant was really tasty and well-seasoned. Skip the mayonnaise dipping sauce it's served with. It was not good. 

We tried a few desserts as well. No standouts, but mochi is always a safe bet. 

This was a 3 1/2 star experience rounded up for their happy hour value. Most of the food quality was just ok and I don't think I'd be too interested in paying full price for most of the items. Definitely a great value and worth a visit for happy hour. They accommodated our large party quite well and service was good until the end when it was time to order dessert and we couldn't find our waitress for a while.",2
2876,2,1546560000000,"My car died while I was driving to work, and a search for nearby auto repair places turned up this shop. It had good reviews so I decided to give them a shot.

I had my car towed to their shop using my GEICO roadside assistance, and the guys at 25th Street Automotive had it up and running again within the same day (I had a busted alternator). Their free shuttle took me back to my home for the afternoon, and then they came and picked me up later on when everything was ready to go.

When I came to pick up my car, they took the time to point out the fact that they had noticed that my radiator hoses were almost completely worn out (which I could see to be true), but they didn't insist on fixing it right then or there. They took the time to educate me about the issue and the potential costs, but they left the decision entirely up to me.

One other thing I noticed was that as part of the alternator repair, they had completely cleaned up my battery terminals and painted them with an anti-corrosion treatment. This was an unexpected attention to detail which I really appreciated.

Summary: Top notch, prompt service from friendly, knowledgeable, and skilled mechanics. At no point did I feel like I was being scammed or upsold things I didn't need, and the price I paid for this level of service seemed fair to me. I'll definitely be coming back!",2

To my surprise the place was completely crowded, I wanted to leave but my friends insisted we tried it because they were really hungry. We went in and we were seated in a couple minutes since we had about two parties in front of us. When we were handed our menus, this guy named Jose I believe asked us for our drink order and told us our server would be right over. We got our drinks and then this young man named Juan asked us if we had any questions about the menu and that he would be our server for the night. I couldn't help but notice that there were only two servers in such a frantic night. Even my friends that are from out of town asked me what was going on. To our amusement our food came out in a timely manner and even though we could see the place packed, our server was running back and forth like there was no tomorrow, but he was always attentive of us and surprisingly never lost his cool.

My husband ordered the Montreal Stack and they brought him our a stacked burger instead. I asked for the Milestones Trio lunch with garden salad- I specifically said ""no Caesar salad"" when I ordered. So then my lunch came out with a Caesar salad on the side for some reason. 

The poblano soup that came with the trio appeared to be curdled.  I think they put lime into a cream based soup and it looked grainy and not very appetizing. 

It's a little in the pricey side. ($25-$28 plate for lunch) For the price you pay here, they should at least make sure they get the order right the first time.  The servers were all very nice and apologetic, at least they seemed sincere about the mix-up.",2

No seriously. It cost... a million sheets of funny Canadian monopoly play money but I clearly remember sighing a huge relief after converting back to what was then ""real"" greenbacks. Chiado was a haute Portugese? joint I found thru the friendly folks at http://www.lthforum.com . The fine foodie in Chicago claimed it was the best thing since Ponderosa. With that vision of grandeur, it was the one fine meal we hoped for while road tripping.

The food was just meh. From the pix, it looks well plated, we had good bread and I got the grouper. To this day, I usually default to grouper if nothing from the Osteichthyes class looks interesting on the menu.

Thinking back, I shoulda knocked out a few more drinks at Alto Besso and checked out the local ""talent"" with the wad of cash I had. 

BTW, is it ok to tip $1 coins? Do the strippers mind when you throw dollars at them?",3
2894,2,1546300800000,"I had never heard of Conn's Home Plus until a couple years ago when I received a mailer from them. I went online and checked out the website, and then I decided to complete the application just to see how much I was approved for. My credit limit was $2000 with 10% down at time of purchase. My budget was a little tight then, so I clicked away from the site and went on with life.
Two months ago, I received another mailer. I tossed it in the trash, figuring I didn't need another monthly payment on something. (I already have 3 credit cards and 2 charge accounts elsewhere.) But then, a couple weeks ago, I decided to stop in at the Conn's on East Tropicana since I was in the neighborhood running other errands. I can't remember the name of the salesman that helped me, but he was nice, approachable, didn't seem pushy at all, and as soon as I gave him all my info he said I was approved for $5000 with no money down and 1 year no interest.
Long story short, I needed a new mattress, and I chose a Sealy Posturpedic queen size for about $1,050.  The salesman did his job well. He tried to upsell me on box springs (to which I said no, I already had a nice set). He also tried to upsell a pillow or two, but I also declined that. He accepted my refusals, didn't get pushy, and I was walking out of the store less than an hour later, with a guaranteed delivery date on Tuesday. (This was a Sunday).
My mattress was delivered on time, and it's been almost a week, and I love it! I no longer wake up with kinks and and aches in my lower back, and I sleep like a baby. I have no complaints whatsoever with Conn's, their products or their salesman. I'm very happy with everything from start to finish.
BUT...here's the reason I'm only giving 3 stars instead of 4 or 5:
Conn's would not haul away my old mattress. Seriously??? Why would this service not be included? What the hell am I supposed to do with my old mattress? I live alone, and I have no pickup. I have no friends that have trucks or trailers. Does it really cost that much to a company as large and as profitable as Conn's to not provide this simple, reasonable service as part of the sale??? C'mon guys, give me a break.
Other than that, though, I'm thoroughly pleased with the product and service I received from Conn's, and I'll probably be financing my next MacBook Pro with them in the next year or so. (Unlike the mattress, I won't have to worry about what to do with my old laptop afterwards.)",2

The nights here are very warm, and it's supppperrrrr crowded. My mother was left with no words when she saw how many people were bundled together in the same walkway, hardly any room. 

Each look and corner, there are several hotels popping out, being the castle one always impressing me. The shops are all super thrilling, there are many people there waiting to pose as fake celebrities, strippers, dancers, you name it!!

The first experience was less than ideal. Had a 10:30 movie to get to, so I arrived early, 9:45 to order and eat. My friend and I order from a menu that was not complete. Granted the store was less than 14 days old. Ordered the PB&J and when I got it, 20 minutes later, it was the most delicious sandwich I ever had. The peanut butter was sweet as was the raspberry jelly. The powdered sugar was a bit much, but I ordered a sweet entree so that was I got. My friend's order was just as delicious. The fries I ordered were forgotten at the time of delivery. I went back and asked for them. They were ready very quickly.
Here is where I now talk about the reconciliation the manager initiated. He asked about the experience and I dodged the question. I really liked the food but the service was not great. He recognized that fact and made no excuses for it. I told him it will get better because he is actively working on it.
On the next visit, the service was great. The food was just as delicious and the entire order was correct. The manager and server made sure we were taken care of and had what we needed.

The second time - there was no one at the counter. Just a phone number to call if you happen to show up. I call them and wait ... and wait... and wait... I actually waited for about a full 15 minutes, feeling extremely stupid - how can they advertise 24 hour service, if no one's at the counter and no one shows up? I ended up just heading over to another car counter and booking a car there. After the end of my booking (another 15 minutes), I looked over, and STILL, NOBODY HAD SHOWN UP!

At the end of the day, that's what matters to me.  I will agree with some of the comments on Yelp being that you have to wait for a long time during your office visits.  This is really the only negative that I have encountered.  Additionally, I will say that Diselle, Dr. Grade's OB nurse, is phenomenal.

Pros: decent selection and okay prices, decent hours

Cons: 
Staff are frustrating to work with, it's apparent commissions and the bottom dollar is the first priority.  

Appointments are rushed, crowded with lots of people, and they wont document your information so remember what you like if you go back. 

Customer service is very poor.
I had to call three different times to request my dress to be shipped to me, which I told them when I ordered it and they said they put it in my order, since I am now living out of state (I still dont have it a month later after it arrived in the store). 
 
They give the run around to honor bridesmaid discounts.
Be specific when you order and before you pay, sales are final which they won't always say that it can take 8 or even 12 weeks for some dresses because they are ""made-to-order"" dresses, dont be pushed to buy 6-9months out, for their sales goals to be reached.
  
Go there for a decent selection but it is not a good experience for your happy occassion.

I can understand getting busy, but why would anybody even want a pizza that's been sitting there for more than 2 hrs?! And we're less than 5 miles down Durango from them.

Yes, bit not at the same level Paul's Ace Hardware does in Tempe. If I need help, they are ready and willing to help me in every aspect of my project.

The store manager Bras personally went out if his way to assist me in gathering all the materials I needed for my current project. He knows his store, bounced around to show me all options, and seemed to have recommendations on each project. This guy must love what he does because he knows everything in the store (or he is a constant do-it-yourselfer).

I am a person who thinks typical ""American"" portions are unnecessarily large and wasteful. But all of the people who say they left hungry after eating here were not kidding. I think most people would need to either get 2 items or add a protein to their salad or bowl to feel satisfied. At that point, you are looking at $20, and sorry Flower Child, there are so many wonderful restaurants in Phoenix where I would rather go and get a lovely sit-down meal for that $20.",2

The drinks were fairly alright.  My friend ordered the Skinny Bitch which tasted like cough medication.  URGH..for ""under 250 calories,"" I rather just drink water.  But when in a place with an alcoholic name, one must order a drink. I ordered the Mango Mojito, and enjoyed it!  It was served in an over-sized snifter; and, surprisingly, I actually finished the whole thing.  From what I remembered, I don't think I tasted any mint (hence, MOJITO). That was ok because it was sweet enough for me not to taste the alcohol but still get a buzz that would last me until I got to the airport.",2

I came here with a group for New Years Eve because simply put, PT's is the only bar around offering a happy hour all night long on NYE in Vegas. I cozied up to the bar and was immediately seen to by the bartender - I had a big boy Coors Light ($2.75 HH) in my hand in no time. 

I loved that this PT's had a crazy diverse playlist. Any bar that plays ""Stillborn"" by Black Label Society is fine by me. There's quite a few pool tables here and even shuffleboard! Service throughout the night was great. Employees cleared empty glasses from our table multiple times by the pool tables and asked if we needed anything else. As midnight approached, we were handed small cups of champagne and party favors.  

My only complaint is that I smelt like an ash tray after leaving the bar. :( Most PT's bars I frequent do not have this residual effect. All in all, I had a great time here for NYE.

While I found the fried clams to be a bit on the salty side, the lobster roll and buffalo shrimp were really good! They didn't skimp out on the lobster for the roll, and the Yukon chips exceeded my expectations. The music was a bit on the loud side, so I noticed that I had to raise my voice a bit during conversation, but it wasn't a big deal.

The house and the rooms are exquisite, beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean. Being the end of January and the age of the house my room was warm and cozy without any drafts or chilly spots. My bed was so comfortable I was sad to get out of it each morning. Peggy, the owner and innkeeper, was priceless. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to enjoy breakfast while there (due to early appointments I had scheduled) but her coffee is scrumptious. She is welcoming, gracious, knowledgeable of everything Madison and eager to make your stay as wonderful as you want it to be. By the time my stay was over, I felt like I was saying goodbye to an old friend. Unless you are committed to a chain hotel for accommodations, do not miss this gem of a bed and breakfast.",2
3103,3,1548806400000,"This place reminds me of some health food market you'd find in Asheville. I think you end up paying a premium shopping here simply because its the only one even close by where you can get this kind of quality in vitamins. You pay for what you get. However, should you pay a few dollars more here for the same product you can get at Healthy Home Market? Yeah - save on the gas if you live this way and have no earthly business being in Charlotte. 

Navigating through the world of holistic isn't easy. You will find a tremendous amount of people that are willing to give you good advice. I'm thankful when they can pick up on me with my deer in the headlights look. I have my usual items I get, but just about every time I go, I have questions. I believe the store ratio of staff to typical people shopping is more staff to customers. This isn't a huge store (maybe 1500 square feet tops if I had to guess). If there's not that many customers, you theoretically can have a customer service person with you the whole time to spend however much time you need to answer questions. Top that Whole Foods! 

Selection: It all boils down to square footage here folks. You might be SOL if you're looking for all the cut meats and things you would find in the big grocery store like health food places. I come typically just for the holistic, vitamins, and homeopathic remedies. I have found things here I can't get any where else (even special ordered once from Healthy Home Market).

Algobertos reminds me more of the Roberto's in San Diego! The place was clean, the food was great, the staff extremely friendly and the food came out quick.

My go to is a medium pizza with pepperoni, pineapple and tomato but this time I decided to try out the pizza and wings combo. Fridays are busy and my wait time was 45mins. Previous visits were a 15min wait. 

A steady flow of customers would walk in to pick up their order and they all greeted the owner by name so I guess they are regulars. Another thing I noticed was that a customer that came in and ordered 15mins after me received her order before me so I don't know if she received special treatment because she's a regular or that my pizza just took longer to cook lol. 

The pizza here have always been perfectly cooked and the crust crispy and this time it was no different. The wings on the other hand were disappointing and lacking. They were on the smaller end and for a couple dollars more, I would rather get wings at All Stars.

Great service and we met the owner/chef. The daily special is written in a chalkboard which is located near every 50 ft of each table. 

Lobster Pho - Mkt price at $40. It was literally presented with a whole lobster over a bed of pho. The lobster meat was already deboned. The broth was fairly light in flavor and hearty. I ate the extremely spiced shrimp prior to consuming the lobster pho, therefore it was difficult for me to truly taste the pho.  It was good, but not mouth watering amazing. I probably won't order this in the future. It was a good experience and plain cool to try a lobster pho once in a lifetime. 

Oxtail Pho - It was a very generous portion of oxtail with pho. Once again, the beef broth was very light in flavor and in color. I've had oxtail where the soup was very thick and oily from the oxtail. I would order it again. 

razor clam - It was seasoned and stir fry, then it was placed back in the razor clam in a sizzling dish. One of my favorite dish and very tasty!!

Shrimp with the District One special sauce - Sorta of like the shrimp from Hot n Juicy, but served in a plate and nicer presentation. The shrimp was a good size (bigger then hot n juicy) and the sauce was mild spicy and bit tangy. Will definitely order it again.

Combo plate with Short rib with fried egg and kimchi - nothing special, it's good and average like any other good platter. The Short rib was tender and had a charcoal taste to it.

Fish taco - hamachi sashimi with avocadom, cilantro, cherry tomatoe - Comes with 3 tacos that is about 2 bitesize. The fish was very fresh! Good flavor. 

Beef on asaparagus - pretty presentation with a large portion of beef wrapped on a full size stalk of asaparagus. Very generous portion and the meat was tender and tasty. 

Things I want to try in the future: the oxtail rice, belly bun, and slow braised pork belly in young coconut juice.

Overall, the menu sounds very appealing and this is a very casual joint for an asian fusion cuisine. It's reasonably priced.",2

We've eaten here maybe 10 times, the last visit was last month. 
That order was the best one yet, I actually think I got the owner's order or CE saw their Yelp reviews and fixed the problems.

Anyway... I think I got the owner's order because the broccoli beef was mostly beef and only 3 broccoli, usually it's the other way around. I'm a huge broccoli fan so I never complained, but was in total shock when I opened the paper box.
The fried rice had egg in it..... what???? I've been here how many times and this is the first time egg ever slipped into the fried rice haha.

So we just got up and left. For such a fancy looking place they really can't step up when it comes to serving dishes on time. Also this place is very expensive.

We sat outside on the deck under the soft, magenta bulbs strung over the street. It was a warm, but pleasant summer morning.

The menu of Cacao 70 was extensive. There was a regular menu, a dessert menu, and a hot chocolate menu! M was deviant and ordered something that had nothing chocolate: coffee and a Europa crepe. She didn't like it. She thought that there was too much ham on the crepe. Even the server asked if there was something wrong with the food and if M would prefer something else.

I made up for that. I got two different kinds of hot chocolate: the darkest called the Equator and the lightest the French Cream. I also got the Illegal Chocolate Waffle and a side of bacon. Everything was on pointe. M kept eating and drinking all of my food and beverages also!

The Equator and the French Cream were huge contrasts to one another. One was mature, rich, and seductive. The French Cream was indulgently sweet and creamy.

My Illegal Chocolate Waffle was served with caramelized bananas, whipped cream, and chocolate sauce. I love caramelized bananas. It was a well put-together dish. I am thankful that I had some crispy bacon to cut through some of the sugar though.",2

They have lots of unique toppings, including different flavored bobas. They aren't really bobas, more like round balls shaped like boba that burst with juice when you pop them.

I was given a referral to Nannies & Housekeepers by the Aria Resort where we were staying. They were able to make very last-minute arrangements for us and we had a great babysitter that night. Our son was only going to be sleeping while we were gone, which always lessens my concern when considering a sitter, but Fe Cooper arrived, bright eyed and bushytailed (considering it was like 10 p.m.) with a bag full of age appropriate activities for our 16 month old, which was awesome. 

It's not a cheap service, but given the amount of money you're sure to spend in Vegas anyway, why not enjoy a night out? You can pay the Visa bill later. 

I believe there is a one-time admin fee for booking and then it's $45 per hour, with a minimum 4 hour commitment. Well worth it, I think, after spending 40 hours driving, making up songs about the desert, enduring shitty motels in Omaha and eating every meal sitting in a car seat.

It almost seems out of place mixed in a quiet area with almost all Middle Eastern restaurants and bakeries.  There is only one waitress barely caring for all of the customers and she does not have time for your needs.  

A complimentary pot of tea is served.  I also appreciate the namesake specific dinner wear that is served with the logo.  There are different condiments on the table for you to mix together as your own sauce recipe.  I recommend 1/3 ratio of each.  The dumplings here are served in large quantities per order, which range from $9-12 CAD.  Some previous reviews noted that they compare with soup dumplings, or Xiao Long Bao.  From the appearance of the crescent shaped pillows, this did not appear true.  However, once you bite into the skin, your mouth will fill with hot, delicious soupy goodness.  After eating XLB a multitude of times in NYC, this familiar experience was long overdue.  The skin is thicker and has more chew to it, but that is actually what I prefer.

I ordered the shrimp and pork dumplings, which were perfectly seasoned with a sweet and salty balance topped off with a ginger fragrance.  My only complaint is that the shrimp inside were not deveined.  One order is definitely enough per person, and more than that would be overkill.  I do regret not ordering a vegetable based appetizer to break up all of the meat intake.  Maybe the cold cucumber salad would be a good pairing in the future.",2

Normally I am not a fan of ""steakhouses"" so I was pleased that my parents wanted to go to a seafood/steak place for their 35th wedding anniversary. I've been to City Hall in old town for steaks before and have always been pleased, so I think I knew what to expect from Ocean Club.

We arrived and were seated right away (with reservation on a Sunday night). They have a very large bar area (well known in the area as cougar hunting grounds) which looked nice and fully stocked. I think the bar area is actually larger than the dining room. The cocktails on the menu were expensive, far more expensive that the average for the area (approx $20 each), and they weren't that fantastic. But the wine and beer selection was fairly good.

Now, on to the food - We started with oysters which were SO fresh. I am always hesitant eating any seafood in Arizona (or anywhere landlocked) but you could really taste the ocean. Our server informed us that they fly in their seafood daily so ensure freshness. Not good for my global footprint, but I will accept the freshness none the less. Both the boyfriend and I got steak and lobster tail. I got mine with the small filet (6oz) and it was lovely and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend had the New York cut and seemed to really enjoy it. My father got the Mahi Mahi and also enjoyed it alot, I was surprised at the large portion of the Mahi. They offered to cook it a variety of ways, he chose to have it grilled with lemon. We also had the lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. The lobster mashed potatoes had huge pieces of lobster in it, but was under seasoned. In fact, everyone put salt on their steak/fish/sides throughout the evening and we aren't big salt eaters. I suppose I would rather my food under salted vs over salted but you'd think when you pay so much money they would get the balance right for you.

3230,3,1546560000000,"Came here a few time, and it's been my go to place lately because it has pretty good prices, a lot of specials, and the food is decent and always up to par. I've had many dishes from Portuguese chicken rice to various noodle dishes. 

This place is always busy around lunch and dinner, and is fairly popular. Parking is also pretty hard to find in this plaza. This restaurant is kind of small too and you'll be sitting pretty close to other customers, but this is common in this type of restaurant.

I think the rating doesn't reflect how great / fine this restaurant is, it's not bad at all. It's what you would expect from an HK style cafe. I'd definitely come back here again, because I haven't been here in a while!",1
3234,2,1547683200000,"This place was my favorite until mid last year.
It feels modern and upscale with prices still being reasonable. Perfect for gal pal outing. 
But off late they changed the staff a lot and you see the difference. I went for waxing, the lady assigned to me was doing it so slowly and delicately making it painful. Also the pricing for waxing is inconsistent. They charged me extra $5 for no reason, and when I asked about it they said we'll waive it off! disgruntled right there. I would recommend this place only for nail jobs and nothing else.",2

Nor do they bother to tell you there's a 40% coupon for full-price items as an alternative. I was buying picture frames today, and there were sale signs ALL over the frame department (in EVERY isle!) that read ""Buy 1, Get 1 Free!"", but then I was told at the register the ""Home"" frames weren't included in the sale. Huh?! What's the difference?! Pretty lame way to lose a customer. I had to wait in line again and, thanks to fellow shoppers who clued me in, I used the coupon. Annoying.",2
3245,2,1548201600000,"We were looking for a good sushi place in town, and we found this place on Yelp...sounded good so my friends and I decided to try it.

Its a little far off the strip, about 8 miles, and when we got there around 8:30, we had to wait about 20 minutes.  It was worth the wait and drive tho!

We decided on their $29 all-you-can eat sushi and drink for 1 hour.  Usually I wouldn't consider an all-you-can eat sushi place, but the fish at the sushi bar looked pretty good.   Besides ordering Sushi, you can order their special rolls (Dragon Rolls, Spider Rolls, etc), hand rolls, side dishes (seaweed salad, miso soup, etc), and even green tea, red bean, or plum ice cream.   You can pretty much order any kind of sushi except for maybe some of the more expensive ones like Sweet Shrimp (ebi), and there's some items that you can order only 1 of, like Snow Crab Sushi, Saki Shooters, Fried Oyster and maybe a couple more.  Everything was very good and the fish was very fresh, almost melting in my mouth.  Probably the only thing I wouldn't recommend is the Yum Yum Scallop Sushi.  I love scallop sushi, but this was actually baked scallop with shredded imitation crab meat mixed with an orange colored mayo...wasn't that great in my opinion.  So other than that, the fish was great....salmon, albacore, tuna, etc., The Snow Crab and Fried Oyster were excellent, and even the ice cream was good.  And they didn't put huge blocks of rice with the fish to fill you up either :)

Service was excellent.  The japanese waitresses were very nice and prompt.  Sushi was served very fast and they didn't rush us out after an hour, even though they said there was an hour limit and we were stuffed by then anyway.  We easily ate over $200 in food (according to their a la carte prices). I was also happy to spend $38 on sushi rather than on a Vegas buffet.   I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for sushi in Las Vegas.  They also have a dinner menu so you don't have to order all-you-can eat if you don't want to.",1
3246,2,1547251200000,"This studio is ""Stich'n'Bitch"" personified. 

Like many people, I have phases in which I decide to improve myself by learning a new skill. I collect skills, in fact, and a few years ago that skill was knitting. It is really cathartic, but I did not at the time actually know how to do it. Which was where their handy knitting classes come in handy. They are friendly, knowledgeable and thorough. They are also very honest, which was pretty useful.

The owners are young, hip and crafty, and they know everything there is to know about yarn, knitting and crochet. They have clientele of all kinds, from young hip ladies to grandmas because they offer some very fine yarns. This stuff is not cheap - if you are okay with the sweatshop route you can probably buy mittens for cheaper than it would cost you to knit them, but it is quality. Also, you have access to the extensive expertise of everyone in the store.",2
3252,3,1546300800000,"Although I've only been to Krave twice, I have yet to be disappointed.  I have a suspicion that a place like this would fair well in SF, but what do I know.  Although the cover here is $20, it's definitely worth it.   I have yet to experience a wait at the door here longer than 3 minutes.  The staff is friendly, and I feel everyone has a good time.  The only odd thing to me was the magic performance that took place randomly during the night.  It was alright, nothing special, but it's not why you come to a place like this.  There is a large dance floor, stage, many tables and seating (although many of these are reserved).

The first time I didn't have to pay cover because I had our hotel concierge contact the host and they added us to the guest list.  The second time, the concierge was lacking in skill and so we paid the cover.  If you don't want to pay cover, I recommend getting to know the staff, or if you are a big spender do a bottle service, which ranges from $250-$750, after which they waive the cover.

My second time here was a blast.  I ended up partying with some people from Arizona, and I had a good time getting to know one of the bartenders.  Although, he still charged me for my manhattan after it took him well over 10 minutes to track down the vermouth.  Whatever...he was hot.  ;-)

My only complaint here is that some of their male dancers are terrible.  I mean, why hire buff, obviously straight, guys who cannot dance.  I mean, sure they look nice, but they can't dance.  I think one of them used steroids, which didn't look that nice.  The gay guys on stage were awesome and looked like they were having a good time.

If you come to Vegas and want to hit up a gay, errr, alternative, club, then this is the spot.",1
3269,3,1547683200000,"I attended this show last night and was under the impression that it would have more of a concert appeal than the typical Vegas show. I've seen JLO in concert twice and was looking forward to a more personal experience with my friend who accompanied me. However, this was not the case. The crowd was BORING. I understand that not everyone is a huge JLO fan, but I really wish they would've considered those who are. IT IS A CONCERT! People are entitled to stand, dance, and sing, when they have paid money to enjoy their time. My friend and I were in section 103 and a few rows behind the VIP section. I was one of the few who were standing and was told three times to sit, one woman grabbed on my arm twice to make me sit, and another even smacked my backside; apparently hoping this would make me sit. 

That was the final straw. I had been playing nice and even ignored the first attempts to keep me seated, but after being hit in a more than personal area by a complete stranger, I decided I couldn't take the harassment any longer. I was willing to forfeit my tickets just to avoid a situation from progressing to something worse. I alerted security who confirmed for me that dancing IS allowed and thankfully allowed my friend and I to change seats. They were not nearly as good as the seats we had, but I was grateful to finish the show without any further disturbance. To say the least, I didn't enjoy my time; especially because my trip to Vegas was FOR JLO and my birthday. Unless you're able to attend this show/concert willing to pay for 6 tickets at VIP table, beware of the crowd.  

5 stars for JLO! She is a dedicated performer and has endless energy that unfortunately didn't rub off on the drab crowd. The costumes, lighting, music, choreography, dancers...etc was fantastic! I absolutely love her and plan on attending again in the future at a VIP table.",2
3273,1,1548288000000,"This place has been getting so much play lately I'm starting to get a little jealous.  With the professional volleyball tour now located there and Jordin Sparks shows there every other day - it's really turning into a hub for the Westside. 

I went over there to meet a friend (from Surprise) to hangout as this was decided to be a good meeting point.  Westgate sports that whole faux-town square thing that is all the rage in American suburbia.  You'll find a grassy town square (with baby trees offering little to no shade) that kids and families actually hang out in.  You'll find actual middle class shops in contrast to Kierland Commons.   This place isn't exactly my cup of tea, but people at the center seemed to be enjoying it as it was quite busy.

It's a loud bold monstrosity in what seems (at least now) to be the middle of nowhere - like an oasis in the middle of one GIANT parking lot.   The huge AMC movieplex and Renaissance Marriott hotel are the centerpieces here and chain restaurants abound here like Yard House, Gordon Biersch and soon to be built Gardunos.  

It's like a smaller version of Kierland with retail on the first floor and office on the upper floors, but more isolated, with not as many stores and with huge Times Square-like billboard ads EVERYWHERE.  It looks really TACKY.  I think if you even stand around long enough you'll find a billboard on your back.",2

It was regular food at best, the flavors were not unique and the presentation of the food (except for a vegetarian meal specially ordered) was ok at best.

3302,2,1548288000000,"When you drive up to this place, no amount of four and five star reviews can dispel the innate dread that is uniquely conjured up when you're visiting one of the seediest-of-the-seedy-looking Phoenix strip malls. You know the ones, bleached out by the sun, faux-gold-trimmed red letters blaring at you. The instinctive feeling that there is no way you're going to make it from your car to the door without being asked to loan a few dollars to a guy down on his luck but somehow inexplicably blessed with a handgun down his waistband.

Then you walk in. And it's like you're in a dainty Asian bistro in Scottsdale. Except there's one big screen TV and it's tuned to CMT. Ha ha, you smugly think to yourself - there's no way a TV would be tuned to CMT in Scottsdale! But then you are just taken with how lovely the place is. But WTF? Do you seat yourself? Two Asian women dressed as servers are fliitting about, but don't seem to see you (as it turns out, this is an unfortunate recurring theme here). 

Eventually, one does see you. ""Two?"" she pantomimes, holding up two fingers but not actually speaking. ""Two,"" you say, acknowledging. They then seat you at the only table in the entire restaurant that is made for two. Neatly tucked right behind the kitchen's microwave, which you will hear beeping incessantly during your meal. I am being jocular, of course, but seriously, we looked around and we were both like ""wow, this is the only two-seater in the whole place. They must not get many parties of two!"" While I am trying to be funny, I'm not at all kidding about the microwave beeping.

During the remainder of the meal, the wait staff can only be described as ""oddly distracted and negligent, considering there were maybe ten people in the whole restaurant."" There was no rudeness, and once our orders were in, food came VERY quickly. The thing is, it took fifteen minutes (and a pretty decent glare on my part) before a waitress came to ask us what we wanted to drink. Well thank you, since I've been sitting here for fifteen freaking minutes, I know not only what I want to drink, but what I want to eat. So we ordered.

When the food came, and it came fast, it was a blizzard of BRILLIANCE. I had the hot and spicy fish (hot), my wife had the pad thai (medium).  Both dishes were unbelievably delicious. I had mine ""hot"" and it was agreeably hot, I will try the ""thai hot"" next time just to see how much they can make me sweat. Both dishes were absolutely wonderful. The appetizer of ""thai eggrolls"" was delicious, if meager.

During the meal we were asked if we wanted refills this many times: 0. We were asked how our meal was this many times: 0. We were approached by our waitress for any reason whatsoever this many times: 0. Once we were done with our meal, we flagged our waitress down (clearly, she was having a rough night, what with the 6 or 8 people left in the restaurant) and managed to get a check. 

As bad as the service was, the food is so stupid good that I'm giving four stars anyway. Do yourself a favor: if you like Thai food, give Siam Thai a shot.",1

2. Scallops - smoked cauliflower, peas, nuts and oranges...incredible balance of citrus, smoke and crunch that is all ridiculously fresh letting the flavors work.  If you like technicality the scallops were a  single-side sautée and were PERFECT!

3317,1,1548115200000,"Update: Updating my original review because I had rave reviews about this place, but after tonight I have to seriously downgrade my rating. The service was awful, our server ""Brian"" started off the evening with a superb and arrogant display of his English knowledge and proceeded to tell us that their wine ""special"" for the night was cheap crap when I inquired.... Then why is it on the menu??? Then, I ordered my favorite dish - the mussels and there was a spoiled one in there. Have you ever tasted a spoiled mussel? I have never ever tasted spoiled seafood at a good restaurant. It tastes like rotten eggs, but you can taste it in your mouth for hours to come... and hopefully you won't puke it up later. NASTY!!!  The server barely acknowledged this and the manager stated that ""that's mother nature for you"". Excuse me? I understand the risks of eating seafood, but you should never handle a complaint like that... an ""I'm so sorry,"" would have been the minimal acceptable response. Finally, everyone was getting free mini desserts (some chocolate cake thing) and our server never brought ours.. very obviously... and never comped us for the mussels... not even a 10% discount... If they treat their loyal customers in such a manner, especially on their first anniversary, then I think there are other restaurants where I can become loyal instead. ***********************************************************************
   Original review:   Addicting! Roasted mussels are to die for!!! I keep getting this. The appetizer menu could use some work, but the desserts make up for it. Chocolate bacon s'mores and the pint of Guiness desserts are fascinating. Service is excellent and atmosphere is inviting. It's really busy though, so you better have a reservation.

Part of this was our fault, we were not really feeling the crazy, fruity, enormous cocktails. But I had heard their bartenders had won awards and such, so I figured a basic Manhattan would not be a problem. I was wrong. It wasn't disgusting, but it took some work to get it down. After that, we switched to frozen margaritas, which were far better. I would have gone with 3 stars, but the service was just plain bad. We were sitting at the bar, but were often forgotten and the time between drinks was just not OK. We likely would have had another drink or two in the same amount of time had we been given the chance. But we had somewhere to be, so we left with only a mild buzz and feeling pretty happy to get out of there.

What to get: Mango Milk Tea w/ Pudding and Lychee Jelly.
What not to get: A drink much better than your friend's because it might make them jelly.
What else: Where did that cute Mango?

How to improve: Offer small sizes in bubble teas, and make them a slightly better product.

Erryday Noodles is not the kind of place I'd come erryday, especially not for Bubble Tea because, well, I don't want my stomach to be the size of Pittsburgh. I have yet to try their food but one of these days, I shall.

At first I was going to give them 5 stars for bubble tea, but over the year or two since I first tried it, I've had a thousand bubble teas and my taste has become somewhat more refined.

Speaking of Bubbles, the tapioca itself in here is a bit rubber and tasteless even though the drinks are pretty good.

I have tried the tuna sandwich, corned beef hash, and chicken and waffles and all were packed with flavor to tantalize your taste buds.  You can't go wrong with a Thomas Keller restaurant.",2
3409,3,1546560000000,"The best part about Paramount is the extra bread & coffee. I love the garlic paste, hummus and Manakesh. Though, I feel the bread (khubus) is too thick. 

Recently, they have increased the prices of many items. Also, they have decreased the garlic container and the quantity..

I would have given it 5 stars if the prices were good.

Paramount is a good place for family and friends. They don't take long time to serve and have friendly and nice waiter's..

The portion size for mixed grill, sandwiches: chicken, beef shawarma's and kofta sandwich (is large)...Rather two can eat in one sandwich, as it is quite filling!

My best thing, would be just bread and garlic sauce! But, ALAS! the small portions of garlic sauce has really made me REALLY unhappy!",2

3436,2,1546387200000,"While recently visiting Cleveland and looking for a good place to enjoy a nice meal on a Saturday night with an old friend, she suggested we check out what is apparently the hottest new spot in town. I was of course intrigued when she mentioned that they had Mexican food - as I am a huge fan of anywhere where there are margaritas and chips and salsa. 

We called earlier in the day in hopes of getting a reservation, but were told they were booked and we'd have better luck simply arriving and waiting for a table. When I got there around 7:45 I was told the wait would be about an hour for a table for three, so we promptly posted up at the bar and got ourselves a cucumber and spicy mango margarita - both of which could not have been more different or more phenomenal. The cucumber marg was cool and refreshing, a delicious summer beverage and the mango was spicy - seriously so - and delicious - the perfect pair with their guac and chips. 

We were seated in a little under 45 minutes from the time we walked in, which wasn't bad and went fast while seated at the bar, enjoying the first drinks. Immediately when we sat down we began perusing and knew we wanted some queso and guac. It took a few minutes before a server appeared and when he did we promptly ordered some cucumber guac and some chorizo queso. The queso and guac were unusual - the queso in an amazing way - it wasn't so cheesy and contained a very generous portion of sausage and onions and was served with tacos. The guac however wasn't really my jam - I didn't love the cucumbers in there and found myself eating around them. 

We got the gouda dumplings which were unlike anything else I've ever tasted and were amazing. We also tried the shrimp taquitos which came in a sauce that was literally unreal - seriously I was dipping my chips in it and would have eaten it with a spoon. We also go the brisket tamales which were good, but a little sweet for the mood I was in that night and not enough relleno sauce in my book. We also got a side of beans and rice and I rarely say this, but the rice was heavenly with some lime on it - seriously the best white sticky rice I've ever had. 

The prices for the quality and portions were great - for two apps, two drinks, three side dishes and two mains we paid $90 and took home two large to go boxes because we just couldn't finish everything. This place is 4.5 stars, just can't give it the full 5 because the service was a little slow and I didn't dig the cucumber guac.",2

Was a lot of food (good portion sizes) The osso bucco was pretty good, and the foccacia for soaking up all the sauces was amazing, but the highlight we all agreed upon were the crespelles. Soft pillowy texture surrounding silky cheese. It is really loud on account of the high ceilings (This used to be a bank of Nova Scotia, but it closed after getting robbed too many times) but not so bad that I couldn't hear other people at the table. Great atmosphere with cool artwork and dim lighting. Service was attentive and on point.",2

Definitely too much for 2 people (the menu does state for 3+), but we were greedy and indecisive and I thought this was a perfect choice. 

We liked everything on the 18+ inch tray, but our favorites were the doro wat (chicken), key sega wat (beef), tikel gomen (cabbage), and misir wat (red lentils). 

Their iced teas are yummy and service was informative and attentive! The sampler was pricey, but now that we know what we like we can order more cheaply. 

Definitely worth the unique experience. We'll be back!",3

3470,1,1548806400000,"I am from Florida so Publix is near and dear to my heart.  This store is shiny and new.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  At the deli if you order the ""all natural"" turkey, they clean the slicer thoroughly before they slice the turkey.  I've never seen that anywhere else, and it's great for those with food sensitivities who don't want cross-contamination.  Favorites we buy there are the vegan bites (they have been re-named oatmeal bites) near the registers, the fresh fried chicken at the deli, and the organic Jim's coffee, which is available in bulk or bags.  There is a surprising variety of high quality vitamins, supplements, herbs (such as Gaia herbal formulas) and protein products (including Quest), and I have bought them there in a pinch when I run out of something I really need.  This is the only store in Mint Hill where I know I can get these quality supplements so that I don't have to drive over to Matthews.  An area where you can improve, Publix, is to get some better fresh coffee offerings.  There's something special about walking around the store with a cup of fresh coffee.  You linger longer in the store, and buy more food.  That pitiful machine at the front of the store isn't getting it done, if for no other reason than the powdered ""cream"" offering.  No coffee lover will use powdered cream.  You likely don't want to be a copycat of the place across the street, but something has to be done, preferably before the weather turns cold.",2

We also tried the kidney, love it! The chicken in hot wok, love it! The steamed whole tilapia, you HAVE TO try it!!! Super delicious!!!

The water-boiled series are a little bit turned down for me. The taste is weird and there should be way more vegetables in the soup.

 It's my favorite place now! 

PROS:

Perfect location near the strip (two thumbs up)...No Resort fees :)...Check-in is quick...The rooms are very clean (I'm real OCD so I check everything)...Rooms have nice kitchenette area also floor to ceiling windows....Smoke Free (Yaaayyyy)...It's connected to Miracle Mile (double plus)...Fat Tuesdays (gotta have)...Earl of Sandwhich (the Best)...My list could go on and on about how GREAT this place is. 

CONS:

$15/a day valet ;( (but you can park free at the mall if you don't mind the walk)
Check out time is 10 a.m. :( (REALLY  Elara...who even gets up that early in Vegas)
No Noise Policy (1st=Warning 2nd=Guest Must Leave 3rd=You get kicked out with NO refund)..This didn't really bother us though because we're hardly in our room, but think twice before booking if your planning on partying in your room or you don't know how to be quiet.  
No Casino in hotel (but I don't gamble so that's not a problem for me)

We were lucky enough to snag the last available table in a cozy corner against a comfy leather banquet infront of a high table with the Leafs game playing on all the flat screen tvs.

Our cheery waitress comes over to greet us and gives us time to go over the menus. She comes back to take our drink orders. Fionn is one of the few pubs that carry the only beer I drink so I felt the need to indulge.

Fruli - Strawberry flavoured beer is served up cold in the bottle and is fruity & refreshing 

For Appetizer we decide to go with something a little different

Buffalo Chicken Meatball Skewers - Chicken meatballs tossed in our medium wing sauce, blue cheese drizzle. Served with celery sticks, medium wing sauce for dipping
Three plump tender meatballs with a distinct chicken flavour not quite as juicy as a beef meatball but I loved the wing sauce. Just the right amount of heat and tang I couldn't help but dip every morsel in it. 

For main I decided to keep it Irish

Corned Beef & Cabbage
Lester's legendary corned beef, Montréal's favourite since 1931, cabbage, mustard,
buttermilk mashed potatoes
Huge portion, Tender corned beef, on a mountain chunky homemade buttermilk mashed potatoes. Great flavour, a true to stick to your ribs hearty meal!

As soon as I saw the dessert menu I knew what I had to have!

Red Velvet Donuts - Icing sugar, white chocolate sauce.
This is a MUST have! These warm & plump sweet little donuts were simply heavenly! I'd take them over tiny tom donuts any day! 
*Don't forget to add some french vanilla ice cream for the ultimate hot & cold luscious finish to a fab meal

We visited Bob just a day after their grand opening. I waited a long time to order, not because of a long line, just super slow service. I waited even longer for my beverage, and while I waited I watched as the counter person forgot to give customer after customer their baked goods. The London Fog I ordered was very tasty, but I have no idea why it took so long to make. We also had a drip coffee, it was so acidic we only drank a third of the cup before throwing it out. 

There was a female barista, and a female counter person. As they worked, an unsmiling, unengaged man stood behind them and watched. He made no attempt to speak to any of the customers. I can only assume that he was the owner, supervising - but shouldn't the owner, on day two of business, make an effort to smile and say hi?

The unsmiling management only heightened the overbearing masculine energy of this place. It's all very smug, as if they are planning on franchising into the next Starbucks. I think it's supposed to be gritty, but it just seems contrived? Boring. Functionally, those metal shelves are at just the right height to put your kid's eye out. Despite this being a family heavy neighborhood (indeed, Bob is right across the street from Action Potential Lab!), there is no change table, not even a hook for your bag or coat in the basement washrooms. The ladies room had no toilet paper at all. Overall, the whole vibe was unfriendly. I like my coffee shops to be warm, cozy, welcoming, and inviting. Bob is not a place that I want to spend time in.

She brought my mother's beverage, but not mine. I had to ask again. My mother had to ask 3x for sugar for tea and eventually got up and got it herself. Lauren saw her and turned the other way. We waited a long time for our appetizer, eggplant pie, it was barely warm. My mother did not want to complain and ate some of it. We waited even longer for our first course from the pick 2 lunch specials. We were there close to an hour before we got our salads.

1) $16 cab ride from Encore, which is already on the north end of the strip
2) neighborhood itself is very seedy and impossible to get a cab AFTERWARDS. Ended up going to a gas station and a local pizza delivery guy gave us a ride. (Note: order from Prima Pizza!!)
3) bartenders and cocktail waitresses were both yawning multiple times! It was only midnight. Not a great tone to set for patrons. 
4) I asked for a Moscow Mule and they were 'out of' ginger beer. What kind of speakeasy doesn't have ginger beer. 
5) I settled for their 'House Speciality' drink the 'Expressionist', which was okay, but the bartender didn't even know the ingredients so she had a reference her cheat sheet. Lame. 
6) I asked for a Kir Royal for my wife. A very basic and simple drink but bartender said she didn't know what it was and made no effort to ask. 
7) $14 per drink for all of the above is a joke.

The mofongo is scratch made while you wait and positively delicious! I highly recommend the shrimp mofongo...well worth the extra four bucks.  I tasted the wife's carne guisado mofongo and, while tasty, didn't rival the garlicky shrimp mofongo (think shrimp scampy). I am in love! My wife was raised in Puerto Rico and she said this is some of the best mofongo that she's had. She pointed out that the yummy crunchy bits in the bowl were chicharrón (fried pig skin).  That gave the mofongo a nice texture, with a little bit of crunch every couple of bites.

My daughter's chicken quesadilla was also fresh and off the hook good.  

Their house made hot sauce was tasty too.  Can't wait to try other items.

Killer mofongo!",2

Met with Sherry who displayed very little professionalism! Red flag signs throughout the interview as she indicated that the person who I was on the phone with was ""let go"" and interrupting me as I explained my current job position to comment that the insurance industry that I work in is such a terrible industry. Irrelevant comments/opinions that she did not need to share with me! So unprofessional! She said she would communicate with me during the process and reach out to other offices to help find me a job in my desired state. I had not heard from her for about 2 weeks and no response after I sent a followup email. The degree of professionalism as well as courtesy is at its lowest here.

I'm guessing this place must have high turnover rates. And also heard that appleone is the lowest in the tiers of recruiting agencies. Wish I knew that before wasting my time with them! Word of advice, avoid this place as there are much better recruiting agencies out there.",2

However, the service is extremely slow. Luckily we were the only ones in line at the time we ordered so it wasn't so bad for us, but right after, a large crowd came in for the dinner rush and it was SO. SLOW. The poor guy was bombarded, and didn't have help, but he could have also worked faster!

Server was fairly attentive and friendly enough. Ordered the Fat Cat (iirc) burger - this is the ""CNN Top 10 burger"" they tout - I guess I buy that if they ranked only 25 or so. It was a good burger but not extraordinary at all. 6 oz patty (just right) was medium well but pretty moist, somewhat greasy. Sweet potato fries were ok and in a pretty large portion.

The workouts are very intense but you can still go at your own pace. I love this place but I would love it even more if rates would stop raising and if somehow classes were to be limited to a smaller amount of people or the owners open a new location.

No call, no apology, not able to contact the delivery man to see when/if arriving. Had planned to cook that day so the meat could rest a couple days in the fridge, having company and a tight weekend so had to re-arrange everything because of these incompetents.

Service wise, it's a chinese restaurant. We don't have type for politeness. Just wave em down and get to business. 

The downtown location gets a 3 star because of the venue itself. 
It's loud and noisy. And cramped. Sitting on the bench (no cushion) we were really close to the next table. Everyone can hear my conversation and I can here there.

We were not able to check in until 4 pm. So we went to another hotel for the night. The Best Western down the strip was able to accommodate us immediately. And for the same price.  The next day we finally checked in at the Flamingo and went to our room. It was a king bed. There was a great view of the pool from the tenth floor. I also liked that they did not have carpeting. The room seemed to be renovated recently.  Although, my husband thought the lamps were from the 60's. Lol. We did not spend a lot of time in room except to shower and sleep. There were a few things that needed attention though. 

The bathtub faucet continually ran. Not dripped but ran. We put a towel in the tub so we did not hear the constant drops.  The wallpaper above the window was peeling in the corner. The lightbulb in the bathroom was not working. I couldn't figure out why it was so dark. Until the second day. The drain in the sink was very slow going down. My biggest concern was the outlet next to the bed appeared to have a prong broke off in it. I did inform the clerk when I was checking out. I told him it may be a fire hazard. He did note that in the checkout notes. But nothing else. 

When you stay here, at least in our room, there is no refrigerator there is no microwave   You need to pay for the shuttle to and from the airport, about $7 a person. That is about the same as a cab. 

It is a beautiful hotel.the only problem with walking the casino or going sightseeing is the people who stop you constantly to purchase shows and stuff. It gets really pushy at times. If I wanted tickets I would get the or ask how to get them. It's not just in the casinos or hotels it's everywhere. The one concierge was extremely helpful  was named Ron. The self check in kept telling us to see the clerks. He was able to explain what we needed. 

You can also check your luggage before check in if you are early. Then , they will deliver it to your room when you get there. The people working the luggage check in were great. Very helpful. Gave recommendations for sites and where to eat. 

Would I stay there again? Probably, if I went with my brothers who are high rollers. They get comps and upgrades all the time. This was our first time. My daughter gave us a tip, to get the three day bus pass. Unlimited ridding. Use the phone App. You will need to update every day the app.

Better cleaning services that notice things like liquor bottles/caps under the table and bloody kleenex re-stuffed in the tissue box (that was a nice surprise).

Honestly, I think we were both impressed with the food. Nice portions, tasty sauces (I had the pepper mayo, she had the garlic mayo) and the fish was fresh and the fries were awesome. She went with the Trout, the fish itself wasn't super flavourful, but the batter they cooked it in added quite a buttery compliments that we eaten together (as you should) really brought the fish alive. 

As for me, I went for the Scallops. Honestly, I have to say, I really, really enjoyed them. The batter was nice and crispy, but not to the point of hurting your gums, the seafood was soft and very flavourful. Adding the dipping sauces, you really get the full effect. Pepper mayo + Scallops = happy taste buds.

It took me several messages and two weeks later to finally get this tech to come and ""fix"" the problem, only to find when I returned that he left the ground wire still out and exposed to weather and moisture.  I contacted the company right after that, which is now a month ago, and am still waiting for them to respond and fix this problem.  I have two air conditioning units, and the unit not touched by Air Pro has absolutely no exposed wires.  Ground wires and any electrical wires should not be exposed to weather and moisture outside of any protective casing. This is lazy and sloppy work.  I have attached three pictures.  The first pic is of the first terrible job, the second pic is of the second horrible job, and the third pic is of my other air conditioning unit and how it is suppose to look.  I hope that I can update and let you all know that Air Pro did the right thing and fixed this problem, but considering they've yet to get back to me, we'll just have to see.",1
3810,1,1547683200000,"I felt like a VIP.  The atmosphere was not stuffy but really chill we got seated we were soon greeted by the executive chef Yoji, that gave us a tour of the kitchen.  Which was not expected but well worth it. The Kitchen  was clean and organized which got us more excited about the food.  

Yoji recommended the Japanese Ox Tail Curry... Yummy... Authentic Japanese Curry with tender ox tail that falls right off the bone served over rice... This was the first dish that came out and it was so delightful.

We also had sushi the Blazin Tuna, was one of my favorites, Spicy tuna with a bit of Cajun tuna topping it off.  All the sushi was great and was fresh.   We had about 5 more rolls and the Cajun Albacore Sashimi ... They all left us wanting more to bad we were full..  

The Service was great and was checking in with us. They made us feel at home.  

We took my cousin that lives in town and she says she told me this place will be in her eating rotation from now on.  

We will definitely be back and will bring more people too....

Its worth the the stop at South Point Casino.",2

The DanDan Mien is flavorful with just the right amount of spice, the BBQ platter was cooked perfectly - pork, duck and chicken all juicy and delicious.

While we waited for our entrees, we snacked on a couple of crunchy egg rolls for a appetizer and my husband had a cup of egg drop soup that came with his meal. All was delicious, nothing unique about the appetizer, but as expected. I ordered the daily ramen and my husband ordered the teriyaki chicken. I like that they offer white or brown rice as a option. 
The ramen was very good- brothy and full of fresh veggies and chicken.  My husband really liked his chicken teriyaki as well. 

The whole meal was about $30 before tax and tip.

There is no reasoning with the people who own this operation.  They recognize me from my oil change visits, yet seemed OK to insult me and simply act in an explainable way.  My suggestion to anyone who visits this shop/carwash is to stay away! They do not deserve your business. AND THEY DO NOT REPRESENT FAIR AND REPUTABLE BUSINESS PRACTICE.  STAY AWAY!",2
3838,1,1546387200000,"Best coffee in the Scottsdale area. 

A bit pricey, and if you're looking for Starbucks-type coffee the way YOU like it, go to Starbucks. These guys won't ice your espresso because it gets bitter, and won't put your espresso in a paper cup to go. It's unlikely you can order a caramel macchiato or the other weird sugar bombs people seem to like from Starbucks or Coffee Bean Tea Leaf. But you know what?The drink that comes over that counter is REALLY GOOD. 

Also, great selection of beer! Glad to know I can go somewhere on the weekend to have a latte then a beer while I work -- or maybe a couple beers, until I no longer feel like working. Plenty of space to work, excellent interior design (I believe the owner makes the really functional and comfortable industrial-modern furniture) and luckily, the crowd in the Scottsdale location turns over pretty quick, no one is sitting around for hours or needing to get kicked out by the baristas. 

It's a little unclear what food they serve, there's always a couple things in the case next to the counter, have never tried any of it. Too busy trying to figure out if I want another cup of coffee or a beer.",2

The cook took 5 pre rolled tacos out of the freezer, literally dipped them in hot oil for about 3 minutes, packed them up and gave them to my mom. She took one bite and was completely unsatisfied! She said she will never go there again! I personally think that her expectations may have been a little high when it came to this place and it's food. Try it for yourself.

In the meantime, 4 cars who were 100% behind me in the line (based on the white marker on their window), finished before mine. A young man who had 2 cars there, a Cadillac and Mercedes, took about 4 guys to clean his two cars, which left one guy to man the remaining 6 cars that were in line to be dried. 

I then get in my car to find out the interior was still not cleaned, which I paid for on the Works package. $16.99 to get my car washed on the exterior, with a mediocre interior wipe down, and waited 41 minutes for it all.

3854,2,1548201600000,"Dos Juevos is still wearing the hand-me-down clothing of former tenant Julio G's.  The sign has changed and that's about it.

The Good:
To my surprise though, decent food at very good prices (had the beef burrito w/cheese.. take out).

Drink prices are affordable considering it's Old town Scottsdale.. be advised you'll need to drink a lot to endure the atmosphere so it's probably a wash.

Bathroom was clean so points for that, BUT... out of paper towels.

The Bad:
Slow service with a bartender that has no interest in the business, bored and inattentive wait staff.  No propane for outside patio heaters.  

The Ugly:
Something fresh is needed for decor.  Bad mojo leftover from amateur that last decorated the place. Cheap black and white tiles at a Mexican restaurant? Looks more like 50's style diner. 

Recommendations: 
Hire new staff or try to train existing on good service procedures.

Perform a total remodel or tear-down/re-build.  

If the owner is a cheapo tightwad type, at the very least, tear down all the wall tiles and throw up some drywall (yes, paint it also).  Paint the outside also and remove all traces of the Julio G's failure.

For locals, suggest take out for now...  well, if you can find someone willing to serve you. 

For tourists, run away as fast as you can.. there are dozens of better choices in the immediate area.

Wrap up:
Great potential for a profitable restaurant. Missing fundamentals though.
It really takes some juevos to run a place like this. This is not typical of Old town Scottsdale restaurants.",2

A previous reviewer was correct:  the chicken liver pate/ the amuse bouche was the best dish of the evening. The staff were bland, left the used dished sit a long time before clearing and the room was half empty.  The hostess was strange.  The ceasar salad which they plated for two was served in soup bowls and it looked and tasted on a par with Denny's.  The onions rings were floury, doughy and greasy and served in a peculiar small dish as a spire.  The steak was disappointing in taste altho cooked well, and was served in a warm, not hot, cask iron pan.  The sauces were uninteresting and served again like at a coffee shop.  The hotel is great and the room is nice with a very nice chalk board mural but the food and service left me cold.  I hear that Katie's Kitchen is a much better choice in the Camelback Hotel.

It's sad when a business like this isn't taking care of their own product. Food is great, the Servers are not. There are a select few servers that have their heads together and ones I do enjoy having around, some even go as far to make the guest feel like they are worth being there which I do Enjoy. Young Lady Sahara she is an outstanding server, Another Alonzo? If i remember right, went as far to make my child birthday a day to remember. None the less the place seems like a cesspool of drama. Bad when you hear the employees talking bad about one another calling each other vulgar names behind their back. that's just sickening and very unprofessional, even worse when the managers don't respond to any calls going out or giving you some BS excuse, Doesn't help looks like a few of them are under the influence of something. These are things that make me wonder why is this place still running or why haven't they got a change of people. You walk in the place, you can feel that there is something going on, Don't get me started on that Dark Ride game, That was just a huge mistake.

Will I be returning here, high chance I will not. Should others be cautious on what's going on there? Yes! Do understand this place is suppose to be family friendly, That place is by far not as ""Family Friendly"" as it seems.

Same with the bell service. The front desk lady was nice and accommodating. The slot hosts Michelle and Jamie were great. 

The restaurants were excellent. Went to Baja Miguel's which was great.

They have a good selection of food for omnivores, and their vegetarian selection isn't bad--I think they'd be happy to make substitutes as well. The takeout menu is small--I have no idea why--but if you know the menu you can order whatever. As others have noted, they have great egg rolls. The also have pretty awesome fortune cookies.

- boneless fried chicken with green onion

I don't tend to veer towards baja-Mexican cuisine, but was with a group so Cabo it was...and I was excited to try because, well, simply said, I'm a tequila girl. I was ready to get my hands on a nice blanco on the rocks...until I didn't. Why? Because I couldn't.

I asked if they had cazadores? Nope. I looked quickly at the margarita menu since there wasn't a tequila menu (still scratching my head about this), and ended up with El Jimador, which I took approximately 2 1/2 sips out of because I couldn't do it. No no, I wasn't going to let this ruin my tequila.

The girls' tacos looked fabulous but I went with a salad for two reasons: 1. I don't love soft shells 2. gluten and corn-free. The options for dietary restrictions aren't terribly limited here, but they aren't great. Nothing on the menu is labeled, so you definitely need to mention to your server specifications. You very rarely hear me complain about cost in reviews, I'm fine with spending on quality, but I thought $7 upcharge to add chicken was VERY high so considering my salad was over $16.00 but their other salad that happens to have chicken on it costs $12.50 and the salmon salad was $13.95.

First things first, the service here was top notch from everyone from the hostess the busers, the waiter and the manager.  They were attentive without  being annoying, fast, and pleasant to deal with.

In regards to the food, the wife and I shared an appetizer of shrimp and cheesy grits which were both cooked and season perfectly.  For the main dish I had their signature dry aged steak and my wife had the fillet.  Both steaks were cooked to our request and tasted great.  The wife's fillet was so tender that it almost melted in your mouth.

Here is the con.  The resturant advertised itself as high end charging premium prices.  Their website stated that the dress was business casual.  When I pay 195 bucks for two people to eat I expect great food, great service, and great atmosphere.  And the last thing is the reason I can't give it five stars.  I have nothing against tee shirts and cargo shorts, in fact that's how I dress normally...just not when I go to a place with a dress code.

4036,2,1547510400000,"Take note...this is probably the most honest (and longest) review of New Results Medical Weight Loss that you will read.

First, spoiler alert: New Results does not have any magic ""NR-3"" pill or magic plan to make you lose weight. They don't have a patented ""latest weight loss"" trick and they don't have their own brand of protein bars and shakes. Their medicine and supplements have been used for dieting for 40 years. You don't see a doctor every visit, but not sure you'd want to pay for that anyway. The first visit with Brett and the weight loss team comes across as a well practiced monologue and includes a 20 minute instructional video. They talk about everything you'd expect...the really hard first days where you lose a bunch of [water] weight fast, then the longer phase 2 with slower but still real loss, and then the transition period. Kind of like every major diet book out there (see? nothing new). Brett is totally a friendly, maybe salesmany personality and gives you a great ""Go get 'em!"" speech to pump you up, gives you your appetite suppressants, supplements, and meal plan and sends you on your way. The only thing missing was the ""this is a pound of muscle/this is a pound of fat"" demonstration. You could almost buy a $10 book for the same info.

And I'm still giving it 5 stars. Why? Because Brett really does seem to care. He's passionate about this topic, and it bleeds over into his staff who are fantastic. They are honestly the most encouraging group of weight support people I have ever met (and I've met a few). And cost? How about way less than all the ones you hear on the radio. Call around and check...you'll see what I mean.

Here's the deal. I know how I lose weight...I've successfully done it in the past, on my own, without any expensive doctor visits. I've counted calories, counted points, analyzed different foods, gone caveman, low fat, high fat, tracked food and weight religiously, and seen the pounds slip off over time. I've done enough fad diets that I feel I have a pretty good understanding of calorie deficits, how my body burns, etc. 

Nevertheless, I found myself now 60-70lbs overweight and the heaviest I've been in my entire life. I was borderline depressed about it and just couldn't motivate myself to get back into the pound per week habit over 8-12 months. I would get 2 days back into it and give up because it just seemed sooo looog till I'd hit my goal. I honestly felt like I had one more try in me and wanted to get it right.

This is why you go to New Results. If it's your first time trying to lose weight then they will provide tons of good education. Eye-opening education. But lets face it...most of us who are trying to lose are familiar with the drill. What I lack, what we lack, is motivation to get over the hump. 

When you go to New Results, you are not buying a magic pill or special home delivery meal plan. You are buying a weight loss education and ideology that includes great coaching, accountability, and a few little tools that help smooth out the experience. This is where Brett and his staff shine. You walk in and his staff actually greets you with a smile...it's like they are genuinely happy to see you. Brett's the first to tell you that their low sugar, low carb nutrition plan is nothing new. But he does explain why it's a really great option for fast, true, healthy weight loss and helps you understand how to do it. You get tools to make it more comfortable. You get coaching and encouragement. You get motivation to not eat that free cake and ice cream at work today because you have a weigh in coming up.

No, you don't see a doctor much. But you are initially seen by a real medical doctor who is accountable for making sure it's safe for you to use the medicine, checking your heart condition, writing you the prescription, and determining how you respond to it. I have to assume that unless he wants sued he's monitoring things behind the scenes and not just writing blank checks...er, prescriptions.

Is the price a steal? No. But it's not robbery either. Like I said...call around. I found it way cheaper than every other place out there with the almost identical plan. And you are getting a doctor monitored weight loss plan.

Bottom line: The speals at first seem a little rehearsed and the whole first visit seems pretty choreographed. The medicine and techniques are nothing new. BUT...the medicine and techniques work. The staff is crazy friendly, encouraging, supportive and helpful and it sets them apart. If you follow their plan, you WILL lose weight faster than anything other than bariatric surgery. But furthermore, you will understand WHY you are losing weight and what lifestyle changes are needed to keep that skinny body. They put it in your hands, but they also give you all the tools you need to succeed. Now it's up to you...is it time? Then go visit New Results.",2
4038,2,1547856000000,"A week after sending an email to Flamingo concerning a very disappointing experience at the resort, I have yet to hear from anyone regarding the matter.  Just one more strike against the Flamingo.  

Below was my original post concerning Flamingo.

We travel to Vegas a few times a year, and after many years of avoiding it, we decided to give Flamingo another try.  After another less than fantastic experience, we can say that location and value were the only things we found appealing about our stay at Flamingo.  Neither of factors are appealing enough to get us to return to Flamingo.  

If traveling with a teen, the pool is basically non existent because of the fact that there is a 21+ pool and a pool for kids and those with kids.  The under 21 pool is small and overflowing with 5 to 8 year olds; definitely not a welcoming sight for adults or teens.  

The dining options at Flamingo are lacking in comparison with other resorts, however, its location makes it easy to access the better food options in the area.  

The AC unit in our room was not working upon arrival.  It took us a night to realize this because we spent most of the day after arriving on Fremont St.  When we notified guest services of the discomfort in our room, ""Thanks for letting us know,"" was the response we were first given.  After prodding them, they agreed to send someone to the room to try to fix it.  This didn't happen.  When checking out, we reiterated our displeasure with the conditions and their lack of attending to it, and we were told that we didn't bring it to their attention because it was not recorded in their computer.  In the end, we were comped the resort fee for one night out of four ($28).  Absolutely an unacceptable resolution to the situation.  After telling them that we were displeased with their attempt, or rather their lack of attempt, at resolving the issue, they told us that if we have problems in our next stay at the Flamingo, to let them know right away; again implying that we did not notify them of the problems to begin with.  We quickly informed them that we would not be staying with them again, and they seemed to have absolutely no problem with that.  

I highly recommend thinking twice before staying at Flamingo.",2

I know the bunt cakes here are deliciously good and they melt in your mouth, not in your spoon or fork but! the real reason I go to Nothing Bundt Cakes is for their WHITE CHOCOLATE POPCORN!!!! It's the same makers of Danielle's Snow Popcorn! I've been getting my quick fix of these scrumptious delectable little pieces of heaven at NBC since they closed the Danielle's shop here in Vegas. 

The popcorn may run to seven dollars at NBC compared to the seven dollars of twice the size of that bag at their headquarters in Mesquite. I guess you have to weigh your options.... Drive an hour and get the popcorn twice as big for the same price or buy it at NBC for the convenience of it being in the same city. To each it's own. 

So if you ever get a chance to treat yourself at NBC please try the red velvet [because it has mini chocolate chips mixed in which is just the best little surprise when you taste it] ALONG with the white popcorn. I promise you will not be disappointed unless you are on a really tight budget. In that case, just choose one. *whispers excitedly: the popcorn!*",2

4068,1,1547683200000,"My mother read about this place in the New Times so she was excited to try this place out with me.

We came in on a Sunday late morning and the place was packed. We lucked out though as someone was leaving right when we came in so a table wait was nonexistent. The place is small (with a ""patio"" sorta), we chose to eat inside. 

It took about 10 minutes before we were greeted by our waitress. My mother tried to ask for 1/2 grapefruit juice and 1/2 orange as her drink, the waitress glared at my mom like she was from outer space. I was pissed about her behavior after she walked off without another word but she seemed to come back a few minutes later with a MUCH better attitude that she held on to for the rest of our service. But at the start, she was a total bunt (replace that with a ""c""...)

Our breakfast was blah. No flavor, no fun, no creativity. We were super excited to try the sweet potato tots and these were the biggest disappointment. They were dry, tasteless, hard. I rarely have the willpower to say no to a carb-not only did I say no to these, it was a HELL NO.

I also brought my 8 year old daughter to sign her up for lessons as she has been showing interest in archery lately. When we walked in we were greeted by nobody. Checked out the thin inventory on their wall and was finally asked what we needed by an employee. I told him I would like to buy a new bow. He said give me a minute. I have him 30 minutes and finally my daughter and I decided to leave. He watched us walk out and did not say a word.  Crazy. Afterwards I was so distraught I reached out to them with a comment on social media describing my experience and my comment was soon after deleted with no response and no message to me. No concern whatsoever. Such a shame because I really wanted to like this place and planned on frequenting there. Looks like my hunt continues for a good spot.",2
4072,1,1548720000000,"On October 6th me and my husband went to this H&M in the evening. He went to try to some sweaters in the fitting room and I followed him in there. There was a guy who was working the fitting rooms at that time and watched us walk in there without saying anything. About ten minutes later we heard a loud voice yelling at us over all the fitting rooms that only one person was allowed in the dressing room at one time due to 'fire hazards' and she was going to ""stand outside until the second person came out and sat on the bench.""  
I understand now that the policy of H&M is that only one person is allowed in the fitting rooms and I would have happily followed it had someone knocked on the door and told us that or if the guy who was working there in the first place had told us. We felt very embarrassed and disrespected. We didn't even want to buy any clothes at all. This H&M needs to really rethink the people they are hiring because we will NOT be going back to this store and I will definitely be telling my family and friends about our terrible experience.

The bento box was great for the price. It came with two small Thai rolls with a Thai chili sauce for dipping, fried rice or lo mein, a 4-piece California roll, and (I chose) chicken teriyaki. It also included a salad or soup. 

The teriyaki chicken and vegetables in the bento box were very good. The chicken seemed to be freshly chopped off of whole breasts and there was an impressive amount of vegetables (carrots, broccoli, onions, mushrooms and zucchini) included.

After a little negotiation I was able to substitute the included California roll for an up-charge. 

The salad was swimming in dressing and could possibly be confused as lettuce & carrot soup. I had to request chopsticks, and they were the absolute cheapest chopsticks they could buy.

I also ordered a Mama Roll off their 'special maki roll' menu. After I left I took a to-go menu with me and found they have a lot more sushi options than what was included on the lunch menu. If you are here for sushi you may wish to ask for a menu that contains more of the sushi options.

Both maki rolls were good. The raw fish was fresh and the rice was very good. It included a very small amount of unimpressive wasabi and pickled ginger. They did fashion my wasabi into a little leaf shape which was neat though.

I saw three servers serving about 16 people at 7 tables. The servers seemed to bounce back and forth between tables so I assume tips are shared. When my food was delivered the one server asked me if I wanted some low-sodium ketchup; he meant soy sauce, and that mildly amused me.

4175,1,1548547200000,The egg drop soap and orange chicken is great!! It seems the decor could be updated especially the bathroom. Definitely would go back!!,2

4182,2,1546473600000,"I flew in to work out at Master Toddys. I paid for a private lesson it was $100 for an hours and they also threw in a group lesson. 

I worked out with Master Wong. I believe he has moved on since I worked out with him. 

I worked basic stance, shadow boxing technique, pad work, knees, punches etc. 

I was exhausted afterwords what a great work out!!

Private parking lot with plenty of parking. They treated me like a king when I got there full run of the place. 

Very clean facility. The locker room was huge with shower, lockers and seating. 

They have a full service equipment room where you can purchase anything you may have forgot or a something with Master Toddy's name on it. 

The staff was help full, engaging and fun to talk to. 

If you are planning a trip to Vegas like I was add this in it's only an hour and man a great work out. 

The only thing bad is that I did not get to meet Master Toddy he was in Thailand. Maybe next time.",2
4186,2,1547251200000,"Food was great.  Everything was prepared perfectly and tasted delicious.  On the other hand, the service was terrible and ultimately took away from the experience.  The service was extremely slow even on a Sunday night.  The server couldn't pronounce items on the menu and I felt like I couldn't ask about anything on the menu because she would have no clue.  Also, the person delivering my dish thought my salmon was scallops.",2

4212,1,1547596800000,"It was really good, as always. We had three rolls left with one to two pieces on each and they wanted to charge us extra. I've eaten at many sushi restaurants. I get it, I do, it didn't help our third person was missing at the end of our meal and we were stuffed! We had to eat two more pieces each to not get charged. Not cool to be that stuffed!

WHAT.

Owned by Jessie Spano, from Saved By The Bell. If you Nomi, then you know I feel very Malone in the world.

Pretty awesome old style European bakery in the heart of the West Side Market in Cleveland. Service wasn't great and I had to wait quite a few minutes for the person to come back. But that's okay because I managed to give Piccadilly's Ice Cream a try while I was waiting. Once the worker did come back, she acted like she didn't like me very much... but her pastries were pretty good, so I have no reservations in awarding four stars to this cheap and delicious little Bakery.",2
4221,3,1547078400000,"This place seriously surprised me. It's in rough shape and in need of some refreshing so I automatically thought the worst. However, the old adage is true, never judge a book by it's cover. The food is surprisingly decent. The butter chicken and freshly made parathas were so good. The parathas are not placed on the buffet line, you need to ask the server because they make it to order. I'm fine with that because you can never go wrong with freshly made, buttery parathas YUM!  It's 12.99 for a lunch buffet with some good non-veg and veg options.",2
4232,2,1546819200000,Best vegan restaurant in Las Vegas! Come here every week! Orange chicken is the best on the menu.,2
4233,1,1547769600000,"Amazing!! I love the beef combo here. Great value for you money. 

We love the brisket and the prime rib!!! Tasted so good. We like the dipping sauce and my mom loves the ""breathing"" egg. LoL. 

We also really like the restaurant decor. Very hip and having the exhaust right there on top of the BBQ makes the restaurant not smoky at all. 

We will be back",2

Unfortunately today when choosing what to eat, I realized that every price on the menu has been increased by $2.

The restaurant is entirely blue with blue walls, ceiling, and carpet that gives an immediate feeling of serenity. Normal sushi rolls such as spicy tuna or california are around 4 dollars. Try the special rolls, they cost more, but they are really really tasty. Also, if you want a better deal, going for lunch is much cheaper (soup, salad, 2 rolls for 7 dollars). The service is decent, but the staff occasionally have trouble with English.",2

So since I wasn't able to use it, I told her to cancel my to go orders and she yells out to her boss who was jst next to her Oh void THIS since she can't afford to pay for it! I didn't say I can't afford to pay it I wasn't going to waste my money since I had the gift card with a balance on it!

It's very clean in the restaurant! There's lots of tables so there's plenty of space. The lighting is perfect, you can definitely see your food and even the fixtures were cute. 

We got the spicy ramen, tonkatsu, karaage, and the pork belly chasu bowl. I would say it's a 8.5/10. All of the environmental factors definitely played a role in my rating - we felt comfortable eating there. The staff were gracious and were on top of our water. The soup was a perfect temperature and their eggs were soft boiled. I would definitely recommend!",2

The first time we went my uncle got the rib-eye and it blew me away..so tender and juicy and it does come with the two sauces but the meat alone if just so good!!! That's what I order now everytime we eat here. We also tried the filet mignon which I was a bit skeptical at first because of the ""coffee crusted"" part but for some reason it works. Haha! The mashed potatoes with the creamy sauce in the middle is delicious and so is the tamale that goes as a side. The mango crusted tuna was good too if you're not a red-meat lover. The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the pork. The presentation of each dish was beautiful and all the waters each time we have gone have been kind and knowledgable.  A bit pricey but worth it!",1
4275,1,1546387200000,"Love, Love, LOVE Kumi. While always loving Mandalay Bay- the decor and ambiance of KUMI is unique to any other restaurant in that hotel.  They have the main dining area along with the Cherry Blossom room which is exquisite. We went on Friday night with some friends from out of town and it wow'd them.

We did the $55 Bachelorette Menu- which starts off with a glass of Champagne & some shared starters.  I always have to have the Crispy Rock Shrimp & Shisto Peppers, they are my absolute favorite.  Both have impeccable flavors.  You move into a couple of shared rolls and entrees. Everything was amazing. 

The best rolls are the Hot Mess, Pork Belly, Kumikaze, and of course Pop Rockin' If you are an experienced sushi connoisseur- you will soon to find out that these rolls will be remembered forever.  For there signature flavors and unique choice of ingredients. 

The service at KUMI is always great- the servers are very personable, knowledgeable about the product, and constantly table touching. Great job. 

Highly recommend everyone to try KUMI",2

Won't cheat an them with any other place and will continue to come here until I get kicked out or my nail tech Shannon leaves! She's the best!,2
4282,2,1548892800000,"This place started out great, but the quality and service have really suffered. The staff is uncaring about your needs, and unresponsive to your requests.

When seated, we were given glasses of lukewarm tap water, we were never offered refills on the drinks we ordered, coffee and iced tea.

Food was mediocre at best. Two of us ordered eggs Benedict, which comes with poached eggs. At first, we were given the wrong meals, when the correct meals were brought, the eggs were not poached, they were hard boiled. My meatball eggs Benedict was mushy, and the English muffin was like a piece of soggy cardboard.

They did comp the doughnuts we ordered, but this was still $77 that I wished I had spent somewhere else like Park Brouge in Highland Park. 

I was a regular customer, but I will not be returning.",2
4284,3,1547510400000,"Although everyone was very nice, good décor and decent service, the food was overpriced, portions small and food just generally not good.

The waitress tried to sell us 2nd portions of certain items as there were only 3 pieces for our party of 4.  After we ordered, the runner then told us for an upcharge, they would have put a 4th piece on the plate.

The ox tail croquettes were burned, the large lettuce leaves overwhelmed the pitifully small portion of Peking duck, the pot pie  balls were dry... you get the idea.

Thank goodness they gave us cookies at the end for my birthday, otherwise my party would have left hungry.

I predict that they will be closed within a year unless they bring in Bar Rescue!!!!",2

I waited for about 20-25 mins which was a little upsetting, my food came hot and fresh BUT i did not like the flavor of the baked beans there's no flavor just a bunch of Bbq sauce and beans, the Mac n Cheese is ok, and my meats were tender and not dry. This is a nice place to try and give a chance but i probably won't be back.",2

It's a very casual place. They want you to order one drink min but I haven't seen them checking up on ppl. Nonetheless I like their drink and food menu. The coffee is pretty good. They also come up with occasional twists to it like lavender or Nutella flavoured latte. They also make good panini 

The boardgame selections are not as huge as other places but it's enough. They also have an escape room but we never tried it. 

Will definitely come with friends over and over again.",2

I ordered the kimchi chicken with brown rice again really good! The service was efficient and very timely! I will definitely come back.,1

4329,3,1547856000000,"The hubs and I stayed here four years ago, back when we could still call ourselves tourists, and The Plaza was a straight up dump.  Twelve seasons and thirty five million dollars later it's more like a butter face girl with a mall department store cosmetic counter make over.  Sure it looks better, but you can still tell under all the frills it's might not be something you want.  There is a strange mix of old and new in here and you can point out right away what has been there for a while.  

I'll start with the old.  Thirty year old chandeliers stick out in a otherwise completely redone elevator vestibule.  Painted doors and hinges that stick in their frames next to poorly placed designer wallpaper.  Tiny bathtubs sit with shiny new faucets and tile.  Light switches and plates stained yellow from decades of smoke pop out from an almost completely renovated room.  There was a threadbare blanket tucked neatly between two new sheets instead of a comforter on the bed.  In the sports book you could walk between the new carpet of the casino that is a gray blend with red flowers to the old green carpet with shapes printed into it.  The buffet is now a sushi place, the layout is pretty much the same, but instead of the buffet line you have the sushi counter, but they kept the silverware.  Even the casino has mix of old barely working poker machines sitting pretty with shiny new reel games with fancy bonuses.  The worst of the old, the parking garage.  It looks like any day it could crumble to bits.

The new fabulous things are choices.  They have a sushi place, coffee joint, A Hash House a go go, a cupcake stop, Subway, a McDonalds opening soon and of course Oscar's steak house which will be arriving shortly.  There is an Italian place that is so poorly advertised that I can't be sure if it's open yet either.  Another thing that was missing those four years ago; ROOM SERVICE!!!  Yeah, it's probably not that great and is not twenty four hours but it's another choice.  They also house the only bingo joint in downtown.  Check in has moved from the second floor to a small spot right inside the domed area.  It kind of sucks having to walk from the garage all the way through the casino and then back to the tower with luggage in hand.  It would really accommodate someone who is being dropped of by taxi though.  The parking garage isn't in the best of shape, and being downtown, where you can walk anywhere you need to get to, one may not even need to rent a car if you choose to stay here.   

Overall the experience was a good one.  The rooms are still missing a few things like a remote, hair dryer, chairs for the desk and some decorative pillows.  I wish there was a extra pillows or a blanket for the bed as it did get cold overnight.  The room was basically clean and we got a great deal for the night at twenty eight dollars on expedia.com.  I have booked another stay for a friend and I as a girls' night out for a weekend rate of ninety five bucks so you can see there is a big swing in the rates.  I think the best deals are through their own website, but only if you are booking at least a two day stay.  With plenty of dining options and tons to do on Fremont street, the Plaza is a great anchor to spend your vacation checking out the cool side of town.",2

4346,2,1547769600000,"Fresh food, tasty, and amazing service are the 3 characteristics that come to my mind when thinking about this place. However price is a big downside.
Went there on a Tuesday night, did not have to wait for a table and service was quick and the staff was very friendly. The menu options are pretty limited but definitely focused on providing the most typical Portuguese experience. 
One major downside: the food portions are extremely small for the price you pay. The value for money clearly isn't fair considering they are dishes tapas style. In a regular restaurant you'd get real size dishes for the price you pay for tapas there. 
2 mini starters, 2 entrees (tapas style) shared + 1 desert with one glass of wine gave us a $90 bill and we left without feeling full. The desert was a caramel fondant with pear ice cream, probably the only thing we ate that was so incredible we would have paid twice the price for. Otherwise it was too pricy.
I will definitely go back once they revise their price!",2

I ordered takeout late Friday. I called first but they didn't pick up later found out is because their busy. The owner called me back, first time ever a restaurant called me back lol. I ordered steak enchilada, carne asada fries and chicken wings. They told me exactly when to expect my order pick up and called back with update... I know crazy right. Upon arriving I noticed the place had way more to offer than what you can see on yelp. The owner gave me samples of other dishes on display that had me drooling. They have an app that you can download which is best way to order with pics. Hands down great place for authentic Mexican food, will order again so I can try everything. Not a sit down to eat place.

They had a lot of kittens and cats when I went so there were a lot of options. And I love the fact that it's a no-kill shelter.

The only small detail is that I do believe I was misinformed about Daisy's age. The employee told me that Daisy was a year old, but her and I both doubted that. She's probably only a couple months old.

We planned on taking advantage of the 9.99 fajita-with-margarita special, and wanted to make sure it was still available. 

So we get to Red Rock and I check in on Yelp.  I have to do that BEFORE we actually enter the casino, because my Yelp app won't work on my phone inside.  We go to Cabo, and here's where the stupidity ensues:  instead of just asking someone who works there, we stand in front of it looking at the illuminated billboard that has their menu.  The fajita special had just flashed by, so we waited...and waited...as the billboard s-l-o-w-l-y cranked through each page of the substantial menu.  At last, THAT page appeared, for just a second, but long enough to see that the special didn't have time constraints like ""served from 5:00 - 7:00 p.m.  Great!  We walk past the bar and up to the desk, where the young woman cleaning menus says:  ""Oh, we just closed!""

Foiled again!

They do not. I had chicken fried steak and eggs with house cut potatoes and biscuits with gravy. Eggs were over done not over medium.
The Steak was bland as was the gravy.
The potatoes were under cooked in the middle, but brown and crispy outside? ( pieces were cut too large). Service was good but couldn't make up for poor food quality.
Parking also was poor, had to park behind another restaurant and walk through a ""hall"" then back to front door. I Won't be back for more.",1

4394,1,1548892800000,"I've had an inner struggle for a while about whether or not to share my first visit to Momocho on Yelp... frankly because I'd like to try it more than once. 

I was really hyped up about trying Momocho since I absolutely adore Mexican cuisine. Unfortunately, I think my over-excitement may have hindered me from the start because I just wasn't that wow'd with the food. It was good, don't get me wrong. Maybe I was just expecting some sort of heavenly experience. I don't know. It could also be I just didn't order the right item, which is why I'd love to go back and try some other things. 

Let me start off by saying that for such a small space with a constant crowd, we were seated and taken care of miraculously well. I was not expecting that when I walked in and saw the cluster of people crammed into the bar area, waiting for a table. The owner was at the door, taking names and interacting with the customers. It was like a little celebrity moment since I had just seen him on the Food Network! (This visit was back in the early spring time.) Anyways, he told us about 30 minutes, so we ordered some beers at the bar. Within about 10 minutes, he had a table ready for us with a great server who was just specatular. 

We started with the traditional guacamole, which was very fresh and tasty. To me, it's a little difficult to mess up guac, especially since avocados are so delish just on their own. The chips were house-made, perfectly crunchy and rather addicting. We decided to try the dish that was featured on the Food Network and also a vegetarian taco thing with portobello mushrooms. The meat seemed a little overcooked and I couldn't quite make out all the flavors that were described so eloquently on TV. The portobello tacos were good, but I don't know if I was in the mood. 

I just wasn't blown away like I though I was going to be. Mexican food can be rather simple and still be ridiculously delicious. Momocho was definitely delicious, but I was hoping for more of a ""punch"" from the modern-side of it. There were a ton of other things on the menu that I want to try, especially after hearing many Clevelanders suggestions. I mean, if most of the city and America is raving about the food, I must have just missed something. I can't wait to go back and try some other fun menu options. Maybe I just need to step out of my comfort-zone. There definitely is no shortage of unique flavor combinations up Momocho's sleeve!


Summary: Great ModMex food, awesome decor and atmosphere, staff and service. Just need to try some different things next time around! I'm open to suggestions!",2
4397,2,1546387200000,"Overall a good addition to Charlotte, since I've been waiting for a speakeasy to arrive here for a while, I've been to a few bars similar to this in other big cities and it is fairly comparable.

4397,3,1548720000000,"I am a makeup JUNKIE! So naturally I have to visit the stores of all my favorite brands. I went to Vegas on a trip and discovered there was a new nyx store. So I come to visit and I walk in, and no greeting. I'm used to warm welcomes at cosmetic counters/stores. I think the only person who remotely said hi was this pregnant lady and that was toward the end of the experience. There was a young brunette fair skin girl doing makeup and walking past me to grab things and doesn't even say a word to me and I had so many questions. Anyway I figure out what I want and I grab it and I walk to the front and there's a young African American girl minding her own business. I believe her name is Amanda, as it showed on my receipt. She doesn't say a word to me as well. I wanted to look at a gloss but there was no tester so I hand her the live product and ask her if she had a tester for it. She grabs it from me, still no words said to me, checks that there is no tester and then goes to make a tester then hands it to me. Still doesn't say anything. I'm ready to ring up and I let her know I wanted the gloss. Still no words!!! Only thing she said to me this whole interaction was, ""your total is $13.14."" And that was it. That's insane!! Give your job to someone who will appreciate it!!! I would never get away with that kind of service at my job! But maybe the difference is is that I love my job and she doesn't. Horrible service and representative for the brand!",1
4408,2,1548374400000,I had dinner at Morimoto's last Wednesday and it was my favorite dinner experience in Vegas. Everything from the ambiance to the service and of course the food were fantastic! The tuna tacos and sushi were delicious! Definitely making dinner plans here next time I'm in Vegas.,2
4410,1,1547769600000,"It's so hard to not give this restaurant more star power because their saving grace is their Chef and his/her delicious creations. However, the hostess and her overall lack of ""welcome"" made us feel like we were intruders instead of guests. All this restaurant has to do to be a success is train their employees to be friendly (main ex. hostesses...the front line of your restaurant). 

My family and I decided to check out this restaurant. The Yelp reviews weren't great, but we live nearby. When we pulled up there were literally 8 cars in the parking lot. Odd. Then, inside the restaurant, it looked abandoned... I had a ""Hotel California"" out of body experience for a second when there were 2 lonely folks at the bar and nobody else in the restaurant. They looked more like prisoners waiting for their meal than happy diners. Yikes. 

Not only did we wait a long time for the hostess to decide to stop ignoring us and slowly walk over to the hostess stand, but she blatantly ignored us until the bar tender told her to get over there and seat us. Then, she was rude and unpleasant. She sat us outside and was clueless about our concern regarding the much colder temperature. Ugh. She was just ridiculous. 

We finally made it to the table. Thanks hostess... Not a good start. However, our waiter, Marvin was very nice and served us efficiently. The saving grace of this restaurant is the Chef and his homemade pasta creations. 

I had the Spaghettini and it was outstanding. Wow! The sauce was so fresh and the pasta had just been made that day. The portion was huge, so I had plenty left over the next day. Bonus!

My husband had the lemon chicken penne and really enjoyed it as well. Good portion for 1 meal. Not splittable, which is every man's nightmare anyway! Haha

My parents had salads and flatbreads, the Margarita (very good pesto) and the 3 Meats (very salty). 

Would we go back? Yes, but this restaurant will not succeed despite its beautiful interiors and great Chef, unless they train their employees (hostesses) to be welcoming and friendly. I want this place to succeed because the Chef is very talented, so please train or replace your non-cooperative employees who aren't on board to make this place a hit because it could really be great. The potential is there!",2
4420,2,1546560000000,"First time here! We went during happy hour and the prices are very cheap, but they only have a few selections. Also take note that at this place, you have to cook the meat yourself!

Overall, everything was delicious. However, the beef toro isn't as tender as I've had before. The beef tongue is really good!

Honestly if you come to Korean bbq, order beef. The other meats aren't as good for the worth, but they are still tasty. Also if you write a Yelp review, you get free desert!",1
4422,1,1547942400000,"I was treated to a pedicure here with my boyfriend and his mother. [Yes, boys get pedicures too - there's no shame in that!] This place was different than the typical nail salons I've been to. They have large massage chairs for you to relax in while being pampered, and since it's football season, they had football playing on TV, which my boyfriend absolutely loved. You soak your feet in water that changes colors. The actual pedicure itself was enjoyable. I was worked on by Oana (pronounced ""One"") and the owner's sister. Oana was particularly nice and considerate. The foot file scares me (I can't ever look at cheese graters the same way!). The massages with the various creams are my favorite. I recognized one scent as strawberry, followed by a minty scent. Pedicures cost $25 here. My boyfriend practically got sucked into coming with us, but the staff was super friendly. When they discovered that he was in the Military (which explains the roughened condition of his feet, and hence the desperate need for a pedicure...), they gave him a complimentary pedicure AND manicure! 

Overall, my feet feel dainty and 10 times cleaner. They even gave me pink makeshift flip flops to walk out of the salon because I had not originally intended to get a pedicure and opted for closed toe shoes that day!",2
4424,2,1548720000000,I'm so glad I listened to the chatty lady at the vet! She told me about this place and how good they were with her dog. They are the best!

Everyone there is super nice. We will definitely be back.,2
4427,2,1548547200000,"I have such fond memories of Santos' pizza when I was a kid and I've twice convinced myself that this was going to be the same pizza as it was some 40 years ago. I have also now been twice disappointed. 

In fairness, I have only had their pizza on the two occasions that I visited, and am therefore unable to comment on their other menu offerings, which I should point out is a wide selection of appetizers, sandwiches and other Italian standards. 

For me the pizza just isn't anything to write home about. The crust is a bit thicker than I like (or recall from my yesteryears), and the flavor for me, isn't anything special. 

The atmosphere gives me a bit of a ""Kitchen Nightmare"" vibe. That's not in any way meant to infer that the kitchen itself is anything but, but the dated decor and the dark dining room just isn't all that inviting. 

The service was friendly enough. Not overly welcoming, but not off-putting either. All in all Santos, to me, comes off as an average, if not a bit tired, Italian Restaurant. 

With that said, I'll probably take another swing at it, and try some of their other dishes. I'll hold off on any further judgement until then. For now though, 3 stars seems fair. It's ""good enough.""",2
4430,2,1548115200000,"Flamingo is average- a homage to the days of my youth, when I used to stay at Flamingo Nevada hotels while on vacation with the fam. You get what you pay for- I didn't particularly have very high expectations for my stay here, so I suppose this hotel delivered. I quite enjoyed that I was able to get a fantastic deal on a mid-strip hotel room with a view of the High Roller, plus did I mention two complimentary ride tickets to the world's largest ferris wheel of the same name? Indeed, yes I did. 

You can tell that the Flamingo did some rennovations, yet at the same time, there is still some work to be done. Our room was on the 18th floor, and while the overall room was very nice, the bathroom was really anything but. But alas. I didn't spend a huge amount of time in the bathroom- it had running water and a working toilet, so I was willing to let the appearance pass. Also of note and on the list for future renovations is the inside panel of the elevators. So run-down, they look like they are straight up out of a horror movie.

Walls are thin, but then again, I don't think that I've yet stayed at a Vegas hotel whose walls weren't super thin. I was here for three nights, and was woken every morning around 5am to some screaming teenagers in a room who knows where, but definitely not directly adjacent to mine. Annoying. Top that off with a tapping noise coming from within the walls that seemed equivalent to Casper's friends clanking chains upstairs, and I was a pretty happy camper come sunrise. Not really. 

So, despite the somewhat negative review, I didn't mind my stay here at all- in fact, I would be tempted to stay here again. Really, a hotel in Vegas is only for sleeping at night and the occasional nap after you've eaten too much at the buffet. For all intents and purposes, Flamingo fits the bill.",2
4432,1,1547424000000,"I was very excited to see a hotdog/burger joint open up in the area. The decor is much like ... a hot dog joint's typical nostalgic decor.  We tried to go on a Sunday for dinner but they were closed, so we went today (Tuesday) for lunch.   

I didn't see any reviews on the burgers so I thought I would order the burgers just for this review.  The first thing that came to mind was that it was different and interesting.  Burger buns shaped like a hot dog bun or hoagie?   Mmmmkay....I lift the hood to see what's under it, and find that the burger patty is thin and the jalapenos are jarred. We also ordered 2 large fresh cut fries which I was very much looking forward to but disappointed to see small shoestring fries (which I don't quite care for, but at least they were fresh cut).  I was also disappointed that the large order of fries was more like a small or medium fry - maybe they gave us the wrong size?  Last but not least, the drinks were all ice so we didn't have much to wash down our food with.  

Overall this place isn't bad, but definitely not the best I have had.  I read the other reviews about the hotdogs, so I will definitely have to try the dogs one day. I'm curious what brand of hot dogs are used because I didn't see it advertised on their website or around the buliding.  I am glad there is a hot dog place nearby, but I am not sure if I would be a frequent customer. For burgers and fries, I still prefer to make the hike to Five Guys since it's still the best I have found within 20 minutes of our subdivision.  I'll update my review when I go for their dogs.",2

After they were done cleaning my car they called me over and I went to start my car and somehow my car wouldn't start and the battery was dead! When I finally got someone back to my car to tell them the issue there was already someone trying to lift my hood to jump my car and it was magically jumped within second and then the guy tells me to take the car over to their oil and lube area and they would run a battery test which they ""supposedly did"" and the guy told me the test is reading I have a bad battery and I need a new one...funny so I scheduled an appointment at the Honda dealership and see the printout below of what Honda's battery test said!

2. only steamed dumplings, not the traditional kind (boiled)
3. dumplings - 
shell is OK, not much fillings - so, if you like only the dough, they are OK.
size - neither as Bernie C. described as huge nor same look as photos in yelp

The chicken curry for the roti wasn't thick, I think that's a good combination as a dip. I also ordered the lamb curry (I forgot the exact name.. Rendang?) the flavor was good but I didn't like the taste of the meat the chicken or beef version is probably better. The lamb meat I feel tastes like lamb sweat. At least that's what I imagined it to be. I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the lamb meat and some of the items there were a bit pricey. Other than that it's excellent and I like their beverages that they have a grass jelly drink and Malaysian iced tea :). Will definitely come back again next time.",1
4504,3,1548374400000,"Note #1: They are a BYOB establishment.

Note #2: They offer free delivery with a $12 minimum order, but I have no idea what their boundaries are. I'm guessing they're limited to the Castle Shannon area, but I'm sure it can't hurt to call. They do take-out too, so you can always shoot over and get it if they won't bring it to you. 

My parents owed me a belated birthday dinner, and I hadn't a clue as to where I wanted to go. That was until they got a flyer in the mail for a new Asian eatery in Castle Shannon, right down the road from Pho Kim 88. 

It's yet another entry into the Asian Cuisine Strip Mall War. Does it stand tall? 

For the most part, yes. As it says on their flyer, Asian Garden offers a mixture of Chinese and Japanese including sushi, sashimi, and hibachi. Geez, I couldn't decide where to go eat on my birthday, and once I decide on an Asian restaurant, I can't figure out whether to go Chinese or Japanese! 

""Why not go both? It's my birthday after all,"" I said to myself.

I started out with some Tako, which is octopus and a wad of rice lashed together with a strip of nori. My sister almost fainted. I thought it was ok. You get two pieces, and I finished both without using the attendant wasabi and ginger.  The octopus itself was a little gelatinous, had texture for days, and only a mild flavor. I didn't hate it but am not sure if I loved it either. 

Now I almost got their Chirashi which is ""assorted raw fish on vinegar rice in a bowl"" as their menu states,but a ""Chef's Special"" called Seven Stars Around The Moon caught my eye.  The menu describes it as ""Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster Meat, Crabmeat, Beef, Chicken, Pork, Scallops, and Mixed Vegetables in Brown Sauce."" White rice comes with it in a separate bowl as does that famous red sweet & sour sauce. 

It was filling for sure, so much so, that I took about 40% of it home. Each shrimp was tempura battered and fried and puffy and was the best seafood funnel cake/fritter thingamajig I've come across in months. And when you dip each morsel into the red sauce, goddamn, seafood becomes dessert, candy. Who wants tuna ice cream when you can have this? The shrimp was the star with everything else becoming a huge, tasteful mishmash of proteins and veggies united by that Brown Sauce. All of the other sea critters surrendered unto the Borg. 

The Fried Dumplings the four of us shared as an appetizer were an instantly familiar crowd pleaser, the ""Detroit Rock City"" of our Chinese meals. If it doesn't happen, people go home disappointed, y'know? 

Honeyed, crispy, soft, full in flavor and mouthfeel, the dumplings were like pastries of pork. Yet again, a case is made for meat as a dessert by the Chinese, and Asian Garden isn't the only Asian restaurant doing them up like this. In quality, they were very much like Dormont's Amazing Wok, and we ate them up eagerly, each of us getting two. Dad tried to steal a third. 

Speaking of Dad and Mom, they both liked their Hibachi dinners which had a little bit of steak, scallops, and shrimp in them. Dad wasn't nutters over the Miso soup, which I finished for him and liked. He wasn't crazy about his Green Salad with the ginger dressing. I had to finish that for him as well (For what it's worth, Dad's not used to Japanese food, but he used to be iffy about Indian cuisine, and now he loves it, so...). Anyway, AG's ginger dressing isn't the creamy kind I'm used to. It was pretty tangy, a little bitter, and wasn't very sweet at all. In terms of consistency, it was somewhat akin to a cocktail sauce, and that's the best comparison I can make. 

Sis, who's almost as fussy as Dad (I had to beg her to try the Miso soup), liked her Chicken Lo Mein, and Mom, being easy to please, liked everything. 

Asian Garden's lone dessert offering is ice cream in various flavors that you can have as is or ""fried."" Considering the Chocolate Sin birthday cake from Potomac Bakery waiting for me at home and my recent date with Overindulgence at Burgatory last weekend, I figured it was time to walk away. 

Guess what else was waiting for me at home? More gift cards! Cracker Barrel (I can live with that) and...ulp...TGI Friday's (aiiiieeeee!!!)

Now officially wise to my secret life on Yelp, Dad created a ""freestyle"" that goes ""Darren can't help it, he's gotta Yelp it!"" He also wants me to review EVERY chain in Pittsburgh.  Save me.

4510,1,1546300800000,It was more than a while since we've been here.  While the place was quiet; the service was great.  The Tofu soup was good with very good vegetables (not too many baby corn - very good); wish had more mushrooms in there.  Got the lemon chicken; sauce was excellent.  Also the Shrimp Egg Foo Yung; again one of the few places that makes Egg Foo Yung like my mother; the gravy was excellent also.  Asked about the sauce and they said they are all made from scratch.  You definately can tell.  Will be back again.,2
4524,1,1547337600000,I was relieved to read some of the other reviews of this cafe and see that I wasn't the only one who didn't feel that welcome. I've tried this place four of five times now and have just decided that though I want to like it that the quality of food and service make it a challenge. On my last visit I ordered a blueberry smoothie and ham and Swiss crepe. The crepe was perfectly fine but the smoothie was bland. The bigger issue is that the layout of the front order area is disorganized with things apparently placed randomly and the place overall doesn't come across as that clean. There was shelving in construction in the main order area with no signage to be cautious. In the meantime I noticed sandwiches being made with Wonderbread and have heard comments about pastries having come from Costco. I support small businesses in this area all the time but this one needs some quality TLC.,1

I have never stopped in this neighborhood as there aren't many commercial spaces nearby. The setup is ok with a good amount of space and decent seating. They offer a few other desserts like macrons and Liege waffles other than their claim to fame. Macrons looked interesting and would be liked by kids for sure. The main attraction has so many flavors to offer that it took a bit of time to decide what to get. I had the bourbon and butterscotch. They do brulee' after the order so that's an attraction I suppose.  After the novelty of fresh brulee' wears off this place offers a mediocre take on this dessert. I think there was too much sugar on top and the base didn't impress much either. Maybe I ought to have tried the classic version first. They do use vanilla beans and from what I could tell decent ingredients. Maybe the recipe was off. At this price point and location not worth the detour,2

I typically visited Tryst for brunch on the weekends. They make a mean spicy Bloody Mary complete with bacon slices and a cube or two of white cheese, along with the traditional olives, celery, lemon and lime. Whoever said they got an ungarnished Bloody Mary must have just been there on an off day?

For lunch or dinner, the ahi salad is really tasty, and a pretty good value at $13. They don't skimp on the portion of ahi. They used to have this amazing turkey burger on a pretzel bun with Brie and some kind of strawberry or raspberry jelly, but I don't think it's on the menu anymore. The Kahlua pork sandwich is yummy too.

They don't shout out greetings as you enter but that's nice because the Kinka Izakaya does and at one point it's just too loud. The highlight for eating there has to be the sake bombs, and they have some serious triple decker setups for you to pound down and pound down (drink-wise).  The staff are totally on point service, complete with towels to wipe up any splashed drinks and flyaway chopsticks and returning everything to normal for you to enjoy your meal and drinks. My friend secretly asked them to get me a matcha green tea cheese cake because it was my bday and all of a sudden all the lights went out and then the staff start singing happy birthday much like the way they chant out the sake bomb.

4653,1,1548115200000,"This review is against the sales and finance department.  Never have I felt so taken advantage of in my life!  We have purchased new vehicles from Nissan in the past and had great experiences - this dealership obviously doesn't hold itself to a high standard.  
Lets start with the sales process - we informed them we didn't want to be in there for hours and would appreciate them respecting our time - 3.5 hours later with the ridiculous back and forth we agreed on a price - mostly out of exhaustion.

They made so many mistakes with our service plan and extended warranty that it took over 9 phone calls and an hour and a half in their showroom trying to get our issues resolved - at the end of it all we were offered an oil change and  a tire rotation - big deal!

We will never buy Nissan from this dealership again",2
4658,3,1546646400000,"I wish I could pick zero stars.....     
So dirty...the bathroom floor had hair, hair, and more hair... I did try wiping some up with a wash cloth, but without a vacuum, mop, and bucket, forget it...there was no helping this place. The bottoms of our feet were filthy just from walking back and forth between the bathroom and the bed. 
     We folded down the quilt, so it was on the bed, but wouldn't touch us, as it looked dirty. (At least it didn't have yellow pee stains, like the sheets on our friends bed, in a room on the first floor!)
     There were 2 bars of soap, no shampoo, no blow dryer. We got 2 towels and 3 wash cloths for a 2 night stay. Our bed was not made, after we were gone all day, and no clean towels for night #2. 
     The smell was, well I can't even explain it. Maybe something had rotted in there?  That is what it reminded me of. 
     I don't expect much for $100 a night, but I do expect a clean room. 
     I went and spoke to management, but was not offered any type of compensation. The new GM offered to get someone to come and clean up, but my husband was already in bed, as he was not feeling well. The girls in the office, Stephanie in particular, were very nice. 
     We would have left, but couldn't get another room, in the area that we needed to be close to for those particular days.",2

4691,1,1548374400000,"The two primary criteria for myself when evaluating a pub, especially one with a name like The Bull & Finch, is what is on tap and the service. Let's start with the beer selection, it is comical at best. There is a house brand and I thought this is a good sign but it turns out it is re-branded Black Label, and this is the good news. I would of expected some imported pints (besides Guinness) but this was not the case.

Criteria 2, service. This was also comical as it was some of the poorest service I have experienced in Calgary. There was about 2 tables per server the night I was there. Our server pretty much ignored her 2 tables and spent most of her time watching the NHL All Star game draft. The other table in her section got tired of waving at her to get her attention and could get up, walk over to her and interrupt her television. 

I did manage some food despite the beer being disappointing and horrible service. I had a beef dip and it was pretty tasty, unfortunately not good enough to cover up the other shortcomings.

If you want a decent pint or service than give this place a pass, if you want tasty beef dip and don't mind waiting than give it a try.",2

He was very apologetic and very concerned about the service I received. I thanked him for the call but told him the damage was done and I wasn't interested in doing business with Ashley's anymore. He again showed his concern and I could tell that he truly cared about what happened and was very sorry. This was Saturday August 31 st. On Sunday morning I was reading the paper and saw that the furniture I just bought was on sale at a considerable discount. That angered me even more so I went down to the store with the ad in hand. Tim Bodus happened to be there and I showed him the ad and without hesitation he said no problem he would honor the price. He was so helpful and took care of the situation right then and there. His customer service is a attribute to the company. I haven't seen such a caring attitude in a very long time. It was very refreshing to be helped in that way and because he showed such willingness to rectify the problem he saved Ashley furniture a good customer. I will definitely return to Ashley's for my furniture needs. Thank you Mr. Bodus . The company is lucky to have you.",3

It's easy to see why that's one of their most popular as all the ingredients mesh together so well. I liked that the hot dog bun actually stays together the whole way through which is not necessarily true with other places and the sauce that they put on there is just awesome.

The people working here are very friendly and came to ask me a few times how everything was. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a good hot dog in the area to come by here. The hot dogs are really great and the prices are reasonable. I'm not even sure what took me so long to try it, probably because I didn't think hot dogs would be that good!",2

4711,2,1547683200000,"My husband and I dined here for Sunday brunch after hearing so many great things about their brunch. Bouchon did not disappoint. 

We arrived around 11 and were told that it would be a 30 minute wait. The wait ended up being just shy of 30 minutes. The waiting area is very comfortable with seating and newspapers to read. The restaurant also puts out a plate of mini muffins to enjoy as you wait. When it was time to be seated the hostess offered to take our bags. We were given claim tickets to retrieve our bags after brunch.

Our waitress greeted us soon after being seated. She quickly brought drinks and told us about the specials for the day. She was friendly and checked on us frequently. The atmosphere for brunch was very lively. Tables were fairly close together so it was a bit on the noisy side. 

I ordered one of the specials which was a French onion base with flat iron steak and spinach topped with two eggs. It was a unique dish to be offered at brunch that was very well prepared. The French onion base was delicious and worked well with the steak and eggs. There could have been more steak, but other than that the dish was great. The toast on the side was a good way to enjoy the delicious mixed berry jam.

My husband had the BLT Tartine served with Pommes Frites. The BLT was loaded with crispy bacon. It was challenging to cut and enjoy, but my husband enjoyed the flavors. The Pommes Frites were perfectly prepared and addictive. 

We were offered a dessert menu which of course I welcomed. Why don't all restaurants offer breakfast dessert!? The Meringue with fresh fruit was perfect for the two of us to split. The meringue was large with a crunchy outside and soft center. It was perfectly sweet. The fresh fruit was a nice balance to the sugary meringue. 

Be aware that they do not take reservations for brunch which is fine. I only note this because the woman at the front desk during our check-in at The Venetian told us we would need a reservation for brunch. When reservations were unavailable I initially assumed they were booked and almost went to plan B. A call to the concierge cleared this up. I'm not knocking any stars since that misinformation wasn't from the restaurant. I was told that they take reservations for dinner and they are recommended.",2
4716,2,1547596800000,"Last two times here at around 8pm-10 pm. Service sucks. Orders are incomplete and I have to go back for condiments and ask employees for items to complete the order who respond with indifference. In drive thru there are signs that ask you to take receipt surveys in exchange for a coupon.  Of course this is difficult since 3 out of 3 times I have never been offered a receipt! 

Tonight , order incomplete as usual. Returned to get condiments. Discovered customers grazing food off the order counter and much to my surprise they were holding a Bishon doggie who was not wearing any identifying I'd as to beeping an assist dog. Most impressive was how the two ladies with the dog were leaning in close over the counter where food is served. Once thier order was complete they stopped eating over the order counter and went back into the restaurant to be seated with thier furry friend. 
Restaurant counter walls laden with wrappers, receipts. Lobby floors had spills that went unattended. Lobby filed with teens who are employees just off of work and thier friends hanging out by two tables near front door. Staff to busy entertaining get friends to serve adult guest.

The customer service is great and well sometimes it is very busy and other times well your in and out no wait but that is probably like any haircut place I presume.

4745,2,1546300800000,"Stayed in this hotel this weekend with my boyfriend and our friends. This hotel was located within walking distance of the bars and clubs which was nice because we were able to walk across the street for some pretty great appetizers. I cannot remember the girl at the front desks name but she said she was from Chicago and she was super helpful when it came to where to eat that night. She let us know her favorites and how to get there instead of just giving us the pre made list the hotel had. 

The next morning we were pleasantly surprised by the breakfast. Omelettes, pancakes, eggs, bacon, potatoes and the regular cereal and breads. I appreciate that they put a little more effort into their guests free breakfast and they were very fast when it came to cleaning tables as well. 

I thought about giving 4 stars but I did really enjoy this hotel so I decided to give them 5. Keep in mind that the reviews that talk about them over booking is correct. When we arrived they asked if we would like two separate rooms instead of the 2 bedroom suite we had reserved. I said no because we wanted to have an area where we could all hang and then sleep in separate rooms not be in different parts of the hotel. Other than that I really enjoyed the hotel and recommend it to everyone!",1

4752,3,1547078400000,"First thing to hit me was the awesome smell, the second I walked in the door.  Sat at the ""community table"" and took a seat near the kitchen.  Immediately noticed that the kitchen staff were having a good time, and seemed to enjoy their jobs - which is good for the food.  :)  Our waiter greeted us immediately and got water going for us right away, and explained the special... Some salmon thing that sounded magnificent.  Seeing the plates coming out of the kitchen, I was afraid we would both leave a little hungry.  The menu isn't overly extensive, but it definitely was a hard decision.  I ordered the cast iron chicken, and my gf got the chicken and dumplings soup.  Both entrees were the perfect size and WOW the flavors were just amazing.  Everything in each dish just ""worked"" together.  It was nothing short of fantastic!  The portion was just right...  though if you're accustomed to eating a much larger meal, you might want to add an appetizer or an extra side or something - no harm there.  The prices were a little more than I would have cared to pay, but the taste and quality of the food made me feel like I got my $$ worth. 

The atmosphere of the place was great too...  Our waiter was very attentive, as were the others we saw running around by the kitchen.  The second our waters approached the bottom of the glass, someone was there to top it off.  They also have some really neat specialty cocktails...  We ordered one to share just for the fun (they're a little spendy too) but I was VERY impressed with it.  It had pomegranate in it, and usually those drinks are overwhelming, but this one was just perfectly balanced.  Top notch!  If they were a couple bucks cheaper, I could have easily downed a few more.  

Overall, terrific smells, service, taste, presentation, perfect portion (for us, anyways), and a great atmosphere!

It is so disappointing that over the 5 or six hundred times I have been inside to purchase something, there is almost always a line of 6 to 8 people. Nor a big deal if there were more then one cashier working, but, if is true that one cashier is behind the counter. I'm not talking about 3 in the morning, I'm talking about 7 or 8 in the morning or at 9 on a Friday night  Its amazing how much traffic this place gets and they skimp on the cashiers. 

If there is someone else there, they are smoking, in the back doing something or just in the office... no one calls for help. 

I don't think they pay enough attention to individuals who hang out in the front. I've seen anything from beggars to a person selling watches and others eyeballing cars people just got out of... and they probably think that because it takes so long to buy a candy bar, why not look inside the car, just not a safe place at night after 10 ish.

Now I love drag queens. Ever since Paris is burning, I've been hooked. I have a healthy respect for queens who have been in the business for a long time. I know it's never too late to teach an old dog be tricks... 

Also, the show is titled after this famous queen Frank Marino... Where the heck is he? Don't have a self titled show if your not going to show up!!!

There was so much potential especially with the music choices. But when the Lady gaga impersonator did just dance, that queen just sat there! The song said ""just dance""! You better dance! I was doing more dancing sitting in my seat than the guy did in the whole performance!

I got a gyro to-go and have to say, wow. Firstly, it's a well-proportioned gyro - not small but not gigantic in size, either. Yes, this is a big deal to me; I like a gyro that I can eat in one sitting since gyros are so messy that the leftovers don't do well during a trip home. Secondly, it's an affordable gyro; it cost me all of $5. Thirdly, as others have mentioned, the seasoning used here is perfect and different, probably because the owner really is from Cyprus and knows how to make authentic Greek food.

Yep, that's a lot to be wowed about. The whole thing is so awesome that I wish I had a better vocabulary to describe it, and I'm too satisfied after my meal to get a thesaurus to try to come up with anything.

I didn't get any sides and whatnot this time around, but I'll be back - hopefully for a sit-down meal so I can explore the rest of the menu. Gyros are good and all, especially ones that obviously haven't fallen prey to American cooking styles (i.e. size, oils and seasonings or lack thereof used, ect.), but I really want to see what else the owner can do!",2

4856,3,1547424000000,"My boyfriend and I visited Bouchon for breakfast and it was absolutely amazing. One of the main reasons that I enjoyed it was because it was incredibly similar to what I've had in France. I've visited the Paris Hotel breakfast buffet in the past and it's like the disneyland version of ""french food"". This was just what I wanted, a nice place that's calm and simple. Nothing is too overpowering (like awful music) and the interior decor is lovely. 

The meal: The bread to start tasted exactly like that delicious bread only found in France, even down to the rich butter and marmalade that usually accompanies it. I had the full breakfast, the best bits being the juice, pain au chocolat, coffee & eggs. This is very simple and brought out in steps; the way it should be. 

Reading through the reviews I notice a mixture of complaints about wait time & richness of food. First off, if you're eating here after you've been wasted and filled to the brim with buffets this must seem like an unwelcome comedown. Clearly in America we're used to absurd dining experiences: massive portions, fast-eating and so on. All of it being amplified in Vegas; but it doesn't have to be. I imagine not everyone that visits Vegas wants to suffocate in gargantuan food, and can appreciate the luxury of a relaxed meal. In France a basic meal can on average last two hours, this is relatively faster than that !

I would love to say that I enjoyed my visit here even more, but unfortunately it seems the food I selected was not the best meal to order here.  

I suppose my first clue should have been that the steak sandwich I ordered was delivered with a bottle of Ketchup.  The sandwich was a sad strip of steak with two sad tomatoes and a bit of Lettuce. I opted instead for a bottle of A-1, which was promptly provided.  Certainly not the best Steak Sandwich I've ever had, and I would not order it again if I returned.  The Onion Rings though, were a different story, they were very very good and really probably saved the review from a lower rating.

I was with a rather large party and our waitress was quite attentive, so service does not appear to be a problem.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their food, so perhaps the issue is more with that menu item and less with the place in general.",2

For the three of us, we ordered a western bacon cheeseburger, regular cheeseburger, fries, fried zucchini and the mac n cheese bites. All of the food was hot, fresh and cooked exactly the way we ordered. Service was a bright spot too! Wish it was closer to my home in Sparks, NV. This will be a 'must have' anytime we're in town.

4862,3,1547424000000,"None of the restaurants in the sprawling Mandalay Bay Resort complex really need reviews given their captive audience. However, I'll call out this restaurant because of the service I received last week.

I took a staff member to dinner there for dinner. She is a strict vegetarian and largely unfamiliar with Italian food. The waiter surprised me by explaining to her the different pasta options that could be made vegetarian. Unlike most waiters in high-end restaurants, he was gracious, patient, and seemed genuinely-interested in educating her and helping my guest find something that she would be able to eat -- and, more importantly -- enjoy.

She choose poorly, and ended up selecting a salad instead of pasta. When it turned out that the salad was not to her taste, our waiter promptly removed it. My guest (finally) chose a pasta, which she found delicious. Notably, our waiter waived the charge for the salad.

The graciousness of this service was exceptional. It was generous in spirit. I would heartily recommend this restaurant on this basis alone. Being a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, you can be guaranteed of good food, of course, but the quality of service makes this establishment really stand above its nearby competition.",3

4874,2,1548288000000,"Great in a pinch! The girl that drove my two friends and I ditched us in Vegas and went home the day before we were supposed to leave. In a panic, we went to the Greyhound website and got tickets to Los Angeles for the next day and it only came out to $23/person (including tax)! That would have been around how much I would have had to pay that biatch for gas anyways!

I would recommend getting to the station early (within an hour before) because a line starts to form and if you are at the front of the line you have a better choice of seats. The bus made a lunch stop and a handful of other stops along the way to drop people off. It was generally on time to each stop, but we arrived 10 minutes early to Los Angeles! 

When we were buying our tickets, the Express was sold out which was a bummer because the one we took was I think about 6 hours to Los Angeles, but the Express is over an hour shorter. 

Nonetheless, I think it's a great deal and I might look into taking it to Vegas and back next time (Express of course!)",2

I stop by about once a week and the owner and two other staffs always recognize me and even remember my name on my last visit. The thing I like most is that they always check if you are satisfied with your food and if you want to have a bite of their new recipes, and they are always very generous on the samples! 
By the way, give the daily soup a try, I've had two kinds and both of them were good. They pair well with salads.",2

Thanks for the friendly customer service - not.",2
4880,3,1548288000000,"2 stars if only for the food (etc.) The additional star is for the wonderfully cheery petite girl working behind the bar. 

The experience started off odd as I guess I expected this spot to be a little more cool and quaint instead of situated next to a Tilted Kilt (the ""Scottish"" Hooters). I'm sure the ambiance is much better at night when there is controlled lighting versus the sun blazing in from all the windows. Anyways, my misconception and this has in no way affected my score.

Then it didn't help when I walked in on an employee standing up with the hostesses at the entrance loudly bitching about something. All seemingly in agreement. So I just interjected with an..""I'll just eat the bar"", since I was rolling solo. Followed by an awkward look exchange with a member of staff standing behind the bar that I was now sitting at. It was something of a forced smile or perhaps he was squinting due to sun coming in from the window...either way he spoke no words.

Instantly things got better as my bar server approached to greet me and offer a beverage and a lunch menu. Such a cutie pie this one and nice as nice can be. And she never let my water get anywhere close to empty and I was drinking it like a fish.

Often I have trouble deciding on what to order and like to request the assistance of my server who has undoubtably eaten everything on the menu or at least has seen it, so I ask the ray of sunshine which she preferred out of the smoked salmon and the crispy shrimp. Without hesitation she informs me, ""crispy shrimp!"", her favorite thing. Sold. And I also order the simple chopped salad ($5)

Well if that was the best thing I worry about the rest of the menu. Sure they came out hot and crispy but there was very little flavor. I actually had to salt them. ( perhaps they took Angie M.'s review to heart too soon). The sauce was good but only when used sparingly. The portion was generous but for $13 bucks that should not just be ""filling"". 

The simple chopped salad was alright but very overdressed, rather soggy and the vinegar level in the dressing made my lips burn a bit. It was also topped with a powdered ""cheese"" similar to that that comes in packets with delivery pizza.

I left full but thinking I made the wrong decision on where to eat, because it was not worth the 24 bucks it cost here for lunch. If this restaurant is smart though they will never let go of that little girl behind the bar. She is a gem.",1

4887,3,1548633600000,I ordered a small arrangement for a baptism. Naly made sure the arrangement was special and fitting to the type of event. It turned out lovely.

4890,2,1548201600000,"I have a good friend in town who has his own wood fired pizza oven and we have some really great parties over there where everyone designs their own pizza.  The oven is so hot it cooks in about 3 minutes.  The only down side is that when the pizzas come out, everyone descends on it and you might get two bites out of it.  So, you have to just keep making pizzas.

With Custom Built Pizza, I don't have to worry that my specially designed pizza is going to evaporate.  I decided to choose a gluten free crust, I mixed pesto and marinara sauces, added strips of good quality mozzerella, shredded mozzerella, peppers, black olives, basil, fresh pineapple and chicken sausage.  I was surprised at how quick the pizza was served.  I was apparently very thirsty as I drank two Arizona Teas with my pizza.  I loved this combination and it was something I wouldn't have tried on my own.  Everything was very fresh.

I had a very nice visit with Loren F. over dinner.  I was amazed I ate so much pizza but still had enough to take home for another meal.  

I have lived in Las Vegas since 1985 and so I've been around town.  This is right up there with maybe my top three pizza restaurants.  Great for families, kids, or anybody who loves a great pizza.

4949,2,1548892800000,"In town for business and excited to try out tako based on the reviews. Unfortunately, the service or lack thereof, soured our party on everything. First of all when we inquired about a table, we were told there was nothing available for the rest of the night inside. Not a big deal, we put our name in the waitlist for outside. 

Once seated, we waited for several minutes before a server came to take our order. Once we placed our orders, it was easily 20 minutes before our drinks arrived. Our drinks were simple, a house margarita and a can of ginger ale. This seemed like a long time to wait for such a simple order.

We had also placed our dinner order and when we ordered our drinks. Our server never came back to check on us or to even advise us if our food was near to being ready. We're were a party of four and We each ordered tacos. At the 40 minute mark, still no entrees in sight it began to pour down rain. 

First of all, a 40 minute wait for tacos is ludicrous. Running from the rain, We brought our drinks inside and miraculously there were tables available, when we had been told earlier that the inside was booked for the entire evening.

Our food showed up immediately, as we were seated upstairs. One of my colleagues posted a review in yelp as we were sitting down with our food, regarding the lackluster service. within minutes of it being posted, the manager came to our table to make sure that everything was okay. If our server had just been even half as quick to check in with us even once, maybe our reviews would've been much more positive. At that point, we were just happy to have our food after such a long wait. 

The true kicker though was the manager catching one of my colleagues on the way out. He told my colleague that her friend's review upset him.  What???? Many restaurants will offer some sort of compensation for such a bad experience. Maybe a free round of drinks or a coupon for a return visit. Nothing of the sort was offered. We were the ones that should've been and were upset. To be honest, my review on the service alone would be one star. I'm just bumping to two stars because the al pastor tacos were some of the best I've had.",2

4964,2,1546300800000,"Still searching for just decent Chinese food in the Valley. 

This isn't it. 

First off, I like a dive place as much as the next person. But this place should be condemned. Filthy, dilapidated, just plain gross. 

Now, let's get to the food. Meh. Very large portions. No substance. Ordered egg rolls, Mongolian beef (way too spicy), cashew chicken and chicken egg foo young. 

Mongolian beef is mostly onions and green onions. 

Cashew chicken was white meat chicken, but had no taste and like someone just tore the chicken apart. No continuity on the size of the pieces. 

Now, the disaster of all disasters. This was NOT anything resembling egg foo young. This was a potato pancake with chicken and vegetables on top. What the hell is that?  

Egg foo young is an egg patty with bean sprouts and chicken INSIDE the patty. This was nothing resembling egg foo young. 

We went here because believe it or not this was selected as the BEST Chinese restaurant in Arizona. 

On a scale of 1 to 10 it gets 0 for food, -20 for the actual ""restaurant"" and -50 for cleanliness. 

Possibly the worst Chinese restaurants ever...and one of the worst restaurants in Phoenix ... which is really saying something because the restaurants here just stink.",2

The high cost continued with the whiskey I ordered: came to nearly $9 for a regular brand - and only 1oz too! Not cool in my books.

Service was fine - although it was pretty empty when we went. 
The rear of the premises is set out for live music...it actually looks very nice! I haven't seen a band there, so I don't know about cover charges or sound quality..but I may venture back if i see a decent band listed there.

Like Vendome, this place requires you to order at the counter, find a table and the staff will bring you your order. It gets really busy and we could barely find a free table since it seemed like most people went there to meet up with friends and family to chat for a long time over breakfast and a cup of coffee. I can see why Cadence is a neighborhood gem and its a good place to try if you're ever in the area.",2

The staff was very helpful and friendly from the minute we walked in the door. There's is a good selection of beers on tap but I was happy to see that they had Franziskaner, a classic hefeweizen, perfect to quench my thirst from the scorching heat that day. Had the London broil and Cajun fries for dinner. The cut is from flank steak so it can be a bit tough but the seasoning and flavors made up for the extra chewing. The Cajun fries were the right choice to compliment the meat, not too salty or spicy. In conclusion, it was a good experience and will be back again.",3

They are located literally across the street from the old co-op that left a void in the neighborhood when it was torn down to build some pie-in-the-sky condo tower. (Which never got built and never will. We got a big, ugly, empty, useless dirt lot.)

The Tempe Farmers Market has done everything right: it's located in an old brick building that they have fixed up, they carry tons of Arizona products like fresh produce, salsa, jam, honey. (A lot of it made right in Tempe.) They also carry meats, artisan breads, milk, soy milk, chips, candy, coffee, tea, syrup, and granola. They even carry pain killer, allergy medicine and condoms. There was even ceramic art for sale. 

I could not have made this place any more amazing. They took all the right ideas and created something that Tempe has needed in that location for a long time. (Bet you're sorry you didn't listen to me now Fresh and Easy!)

We were shown to a table right away which was good. But with six servers running around it was several minutes before one stopped at our table. Gave the drink and lunch order at that time to expedite maters. Again it was several minutes until she returned with drinks less the lemon and bread. Not to long after that the lemon arrived and shortly after so did the bread.  I ordered a French Dip with sweet potato fries and a honey mustard dip. My friend ordered the Chicken Pot Pie and a salad. We ate two pieces of bread before his salad arrived and he had almost finished it when the rest of the food arrived. My French Dip was ok but my fries were not sweet potato and there was no honey mustard dip. My friend got what he ordered and we both had warmed cherry pie with ice cream for desert.

5047,1,1547251200000,"**This is a review for their lunch menu**

I brought my boyfriend here for lunch when we were in Vegas. We came here for lunch because we found out via the website that they have a much cheaper lunch menu!

We ordered the prime rib lunch special (he got the Lawry's cut, I ordered the luncheon cut). It comes with the prime rib, mashed potatoes, a side, bread, and their whipped horseradish. The prime rib was still flavorful and whatnot. The mashed potatoes weren't up to par with the Beverly Hills location, which is a huge bummer for me, because I LOVE my potatoes. We both ordered the creamed corn on the side and we split an extra side of the creamed spinach (with bacon!). They were good too in terms of flavor.

The way it works though, is that instead of them taking the order and bringing the food to you, you go to the mini carvery corner and get the food yourself. The problem with that is that the meat sits out longer because the carver cuts them for people in line and so by the time you get the table it cools down a lot. Also, the creamed corn just sits in the heated pots (like how they serve soups at buffets), so it starts to separate, bunching up on top. The server mixes it together before he serves it, but if I'm paying a lot for food, I don't want that kind of quality.

I'm sure the dinner is much better, of course, but I didn't want to come to Lawry's for dinner in Las Vegas, when we have one in LA anyways. I'd rather go somewhere I can't find near home!",2

The servers were wonderful and keep track of your rhythm. Our server made great suggestion for me to try the white sangria. The place is big but it still feels intimate. The place is famous for its freshly made mozzarella and gigantic meatball, which was great coz I was not hungry enough for a huge Italian main course. 

The kitchen is visible through a window and customers are welcome to view through a large window, specifically how the mozzarella is made. 

We had the naked mozzarella, which came with well buttered garlic bread that was just the right crunchiness. The mozzarella was warm and chewy. Very delicious.

We had the stuffed meatball, it was the size of a soft ball. The outside is slightly crispy. I don't eat meatball on a regular basis so it's a bit difficult for me to compare but I have to say that I only gave the last piece to my date to be polite.

My date also ordered some sort of pasta (i didnt pay attention to what it was because of the mozzarella) which I tried.  It was great as  well.

5073,2,1547424000000,"Very decent place for some Vietnamese fare! I've probably been here around 5-6 times now and everytime (regardless of day or time), it's busy.

I always get the Spring rolls, Egg rolls and the Seafood Pho - yes, I know this isn't very adventurous, but I'm happy w/these items. Alwlays friendly service in a relaxed environment.

Wish they would be a little more generous with the condiments - or maybe I'm just a freak who likes a lot of sprouts, cilantro, lime juice/jalapenos in their Pho? Mmmm...

All in all - def worth checking out!",2
5080,2,1546646400000,Had the beef and broccoli.  The beef melts in your mouth. So soft and juicy. The veggies perfectly crunchie. Oh and the hot and sour soup.... just the right spicey kick to it!,2
5087,1,1547424000000,"Always had a good experience here. Food is great, they don't overload the sushi with rice like a lot of restaurants do and use large pieces of fish/filling. The quality of the food is amazing, the price had been going up ever since other restaurants have raised their prices. Being the same price as other restaurants I prefer this one specifically for the quality of the fish. Raw fish can be handled poorly and cause sickness/illness, this is why I have no worries going to Yang's because every plate of fish is fresh (as well as meat) and has no odour to it. 

I have been going here since 2010!

I read a lot of reviews and many are quite ridiculous. This is a Japanese restaurant, it definitely doesn't appeal to most that aren't able to flag down waitresses. They don't check on you like many american restaurants, you have to raise you hand, look at them and get their attention! I wouldn't go to ANY asian restaurants if flagging down a waitress seems like a task to you haha!
I also don't know anyone who is stingy enough to not tip, 10% is the standard tip for a restaurant which even saves you from tipping 15-20% like many people do.",2

The menu looks fantastic and has a bunch of catchy titles, but the food can be hit or miss.  The happy hour treats make this a favorite on Eastern for me though.  Everyone does sweet potato fries, and theirs are good.  The entrees can be excellent but sometimes disappoint.  The chicken wings are OK...but with one exception that really got me going.  I told our waiter, a UNLV student, that I liked really hot wings. He told me it wasn't on the menu, but that I should try the ghost pepper wings......I was all in!   The wings came out covered in a sauce that had blinding vapors rising from it.  I didn't think they would really put the pedal to the metal, so I grabbed my first wing and devoured it.   The first bite drove me into uncontrollable hiccoughs and tears........oh my god it was incredible.  Lips burning, sweating, crying and hiccoughing, I finished the plate.  I asked how many had finished them, and he said only one other idiot had completed the plate.   They need a board, or at least a tee shirt......of course I paid for my culinary triumph that night and the next day, but if you like hot you MUST try the ghost wings.  Seriously.

I was actually shocked since it was on a 2014 rogue and I was trading in 2010 Titan (that wasn't very pretty and LOTS of miles). He worked with me and gave me what I wanted for trade in and I ending up getting a new car. I was SHOCKED at the amount of time and ability to make the deal happen. I had been to 2 other places and basically was turned away. However, Chris wanted my business and made it happen. I would recommend anyone in the market for a new car to go see him.

Im usually not off Sundays and I usually use their range on the weekdays. I had a habit of knowing they were open til 7pm. Me , my friend, my brother and his wife decided to go shooting Sunday. 

Door was wide open when we arrived, got there around 400pm. Lanes were not full , lady at the counter told us there was a wait. No problem. We waited patiently around 10mins browsed the store a bit, then got called in . As soon as we finished unloading our gear inside the range , RSO told us we have 15 mins to shoot at the range. ""?????"" This is when we realized that they closed at 500pm and their range shuts down at 430pm. We walk out grab our IDs back and paid the range fee for shooting one magazine and unloading and loading back our gear at their range. 

So I love how the lady upfront, makes us wait 10mins when we arrived at 400pm and not even bother telling us that the range will be closing soon. To add insult to injury, make us pay full price for the range fee. Am I losing sleep over $40? no, but I find it disgusting for a person to have such lack of inconsideration. 

I wish they would've told us that they were closing soon and that , our time at the range by the time the lane was open would be limited . We would've then left and came back another day. Instead , they would rather take advantage of us. 

I have nothing against people making mistakes at their job, but it seems like the lady up front didn't feel bad or even at least said sorry that she failed to mention that they were closing soon.",2
5153,2,1546732800000,Sushi was overpriced for what it was. There was four of us and we ordered a $200 platter and asked if it would be enough and they assured us it would be. We also ordered a seafood appetizer platter and told we would each get a piece yet it came with 3 pieces each and  ( 2 oysters) when we questioned why we were told they ran out of oysters but never bothered to let us know or even bothered to substituted so we all had to try and share. My cocktail was horrible it tasted like a margarita with olive oil. The only reason I gave this place a 2 star was because this place is quite entertaining. I Would only come back for sake and beer.

Three of us split the Belly Buns, Carpaccio, Oxtail Fried Rice, and the 8 Treasures (not on the menu, a special since new years eve...had fried shrimp, tofu, and some other amazing stuff). Everything was awesome...I recommend this exact order to any of you, if you have a 4th, the oxtail fries look ridiculously tasty. The drinks were a little pricey, but they are all custom made and unique...watching Tiffanie drink a mojito from a coconut was well worth it. The ambiance with the music was perfect and the wait staff was surprisingly not in your face every second asking if you liked it. I'm definitely taking the crew from work here...

I live in a condo and on the day of pick up I called and wanted to let them know I left the fridge out on the curb. The gentleman said that there was nothing on file for a pickup, if i didn't have an account it wasn't something that they do, and their bulk pickup is on Thursdays. He apologized for the false information and that they could trace the call. At this point I was frustrated because it sounded like I wasted my time moving the fridge and was lied to. I asked what the benefit for me for you to trace the call? He said to prevent this from happening again and that I could possible make an acception. They traced the call while I was on hold and apologized again for the false information the lady provided and since I don't have an account to get billed they couldn't help me.

The food is pretty cheap, 5 bucks and worth the money. (Cheap is not going to equal great food). I came here the other Sunday and it was so busy at 11pm that I was shocked and god damn it turn the music down! I don't know how people have a conversation inside. 

The staff i have good and bad experiences with. The one time me and a friend stood there and could not spot anyone working so we sat outside where there were plenty of tables only to be asked by a girl who looked like she just finished a day shift at kensington flea market, advise us we need to wait to be seated. 
So we obliged and went and stood at the front again for a few minutes until.......I said f*k this and sat right back outside where we did originally. Pointless exercise I felt.

I'm happy to say it did not disappoint.  Everyone enjoyed the dishes they ordered. The tomato bisque was very good, the beet salad was crisp, delicious and well balanced with the goat cheese.  The flounder was one of the best seafood dishes I've had in the Charlotte area.  It was very moist cooked perfectly with great flavor. On top of that, it was a very generous portion.",2

We sat near the back and the server was EXCEPTIONAL, being very attentive to our table and helpful with the ordering process. Even the gentleman refilling my water was careful to make sure my cup never went empty and I drink a looooot of water. But the food. Meh. ""Tapas"" portions but not really. The shrimp in the shrimp risotto was too salty to even consume. The filet was pretty decent but ""pretty decent"" in Vegas isn't really saying much...

Edelweiss is THE biggest German store in our city, and THE biggest I've ever seen. They've got everything from German chocolate to German tabloids. They specialize in German imports and a visit is more of an experience than a shopping trip. 

To add to their unparalleled selection of German goods, they have an in-store restaurant where you can eat cabbage rolls, Bratwurst and Schnitzel to your heart's content. They even have a vegetarian menu!!! Oh, and don't even get me started on their desserts. Seriously, just lock me in overnight with nothing but a fork. 

My words can't possibly do Kaffe Stube justice, so I took a whack load of pictures so you can get an idea of what a jaw-dropping experience it is.

5194,1,1547078400000,"We recently started using Sarah when our 11 week old puppy was just under 8 weeks.  We are a busy family with 4 children and wanted a well trained dog but didn't have the time to do it the right way on our own.  Before we bought our pup I searched for ""in-home dog training"" and thankfully found Sarah at Blue Dog.  Right from our first phone call I could tell that I found the right person.  She knew her stuff and is more than willing to share it whenever needed.  We opted to go for a full puppy program that started with helping us get ready for our new puppy (showed us her favorite products, what to do when we first brought her home, etc.).  After bonding with our puppy over a weekend Sarah did a 5 day (plus threw in an extra day free)  board & train.  After being woken up in the middle of the night to let the puppy out for a few nights we were happy to put her in Sarah's hands for awhile and were happy when she came back already having learned some things and sleeping through the night.  After having her back home Sarah came to our house to do ""Puppy ABC's"" with us going over a ton of information on training our new puppy.  This really helped our confidence in dealing with the new puppy as we were afraid that she would un-learn what she had learned with Sarah.  She effectively taught my husband and I and our children so much during that time that we have been able to use with our dog since.  We still have a two week board and train where our puppy will go stay with Sarah for more intensive training as well as more in-home training coming up.  I have no doubt that our puppy will be a super-star dog when she is done.  We were so happy that we opted to have Sarah take our puppy for weekly socialization outings for 6 weeks too because we knew how critical all of those experiences would be to her as a puppy and we just don't have the time to do it.  Throughout this time we have also received emails with information, training videos (with Sarah training our puppy as examples!!!), and fun pictures and videos of our puppy from Sarah and her husband, Andrew.  I have to mention, too, that we have always had dogs and this is the first time that I feel that we are doing it right. Buying all of these services is a bit of a splurge but I consider it a long term investment that will really pay off for the life of our dog.  It is so worth it when I see our puppy really thriving and happy and fitting in wonderfully with our family and when I text Sarah dozens and dozens of questions and know I will get thorough answers back.

5198,2,1547251200000,"Went to this restaurant tonight. Was quite disappointed.  Had heard great things from a friend and decided to bring my whole family. We made a 9 person reso for 6:45pm. When I showed up close to 6:50, they hadn't even started arranging a table. Regardless, they set up a table quickly, so that was fine.  Then I overheard them tell another table they were out of chicken schnitzel..... I couldn't believe this... How do you run a schnitzel restaurant and run out of chicken schnitzel?? Anyways, I asked the manager directly (the woman who seemed to be the manager) if this was true.  One of our party only eats chicken (no veal, etc)- and the fact that they were out of chicken meant we couldn't stay. I was assured that while they were out of chicken, they were bringing some from their other location.  So we stayed- ordered drinks and beer and enjoyed.  Then when we went to order, to my surprise, they announced they were out of chicken.  I called over the manager again and she insisted that the delivery man from the other location had arrived without chicken as both locations were now out of chicken...!  After basically asking for the bill so we could find another place to eat our dinner, she had an idea - take the chicken from their sandwiches (so they were lying when they said they were out of chicken) as use it for the schnitzel plate.... She also offered not to charge for this meal.  We were satisfied with this suggestion - tho can't understand why she didn't just suggest it in the first place.  We all ordered schnitzel and I ordered their home made perogies.  The schnitzel was delicious (I tried it and everyone finished their portions).  But when my perogies arrived I noticed there was no sour cream.  I found this weird and asked for some.  They then notified me that they were out of this too. Quite disappointing.
All in all, the food was very good and everyone enjoyed. But I can't understand how you run a schnitzel restaurant with no chicken schnitzel or sour cream....",2

I came here with my friend who is a local here so she suggested we come here after having sushi at sushi neko. I forgot what my friend ordered but her drink was so good I actually want to come back here next time I am in vegas to just try it again. I personally ordered a taro slush with fresh taro on top. Needless to say I was in love with this. I haven't had a taro slush or smoothie this good elsewhere besides from my local spot in orange county. The fresh taro on top though was a new thing and it honestly made this drink special in its own way. I would highly recommend to get the taro on top when you get this drink. Honestly if you like taro smoothies then you definitely will and should like the taro on top.,3

5210,3,1548201600000,"Went there for 2015 summerlicious dinner ($45)

Location/Environment:
Went there on a Sunday, surprisingly not too many people.  Street parking is available (but carpool would be best to avoid issues).  There's a lot of artwork inside the restaurant (I'm not too much into art, but they all look very nice).  We sat at the corner by the window, which was perfect since it was a group of 5.

Service:
Our waiter was fantastic - he was funny, friendly and really made the dinner enjoyable.  He recommended us a Portuguese white wine called Pinho Real.  It's very good - light, sweet and only exclusive to their restaurant.  The restaurant is a little bit upscale - so there were more staff available and serving you and they were all nice as well.

Food:
Appetizer - Goat Cheese, eggplant, portabella mushrooms, champagne vinaigrette
Surprisingly good.  I loved how you can distinctively taste all the flavours, and it doesn't clash with each other.  Note the goat cheese is a little strong for those who aren't into cheese that much.  But I really liked the mushroom - very soft and easy to eat. 

Main - Pan Seared Skate Fish on lemon coriander risotto
I'm not a fan of risotto - but it had skate fish, so I had to try.  The skate fish was grilled very nicely on the outside; it has a grilled chicken taste to it. The meat inside was perfect - soft, not dry, boneless. I really enjoyed it.  The risotto was not bad too.  It was a good combination with the fish.

Dessert - Molotof, flan of eggwhies, crème anglaise
This is a Portuguese dessert, which is fluffy whipped egg whites.  It was not bad first time trying it.  There was a lot of honey/syrup around the molotof, which made it very sweet - a little too sweet for my tasting.

Overall it was a very nice dinner.  A bottle of wine, good food, friends and chatting it up with the waiter really made it an enjoyable experience.",1

They also worked with me and called me when they were getting close so that I didn't have to take time off work. None of this between 8-12 or 12-4 bs that other companies pull. 

Not only were they accommodating to scheduling, they listened to how the break happened and showed up at our house with dog treats for our two dogs.  Our dogs have never been so happy to see a stranger in their home!

Not having been to this restaurant before, I didn't know what to expect.  The interior is like a strange mash of sports bar and tacky bistro - only further confusing the identity of the establishment.  

I'm typically a big fan of seafood, and the fish and chips were decent, but I was expecting a long list of butcher type items on the menu, not oyster shooters, and 3 types of fish.  Especially in downtown, middle of the freakin desert, Phoenix.

So lately I have taken to checking out the off-the-strip establishments. And I have to say I have been amply rewarded.
Case in point, Sparrow + Wolf. OMG! A foodie's haven away from the torture of the strip. Located in Chinatown, it is nouveau cuisine but totally relatable. Fresh new takes on the classics. 
The place is cozy, intimate and friendly. The fare superb. 
Tuna poke, wood fired lasagne, beef cheek and marrow dumplings and short rib (see pictures) just blew us away (my daughter and her husband from New York were my dining companions).

The lady that did my nails was very helpful, I told her I wanted the old ones off and new ones on. She suggested instead trying to rebuild around the nails on already because it would be painful to take them off one day after.

Dish was 20% eggs over med, 70% potatoes and 10% was a smattering of half raw mushrooms, spinach and chicken.  The chicken was just diced up lunchmeat chicken so yeah.

Eat With Fun is a little privately owned eatery that sells one of the best BBQ Roast Ducks in Markham.  I mean, the BBQ ducks sold in grocery stores taste bland when compared to their BBQ ducks.  Eat With Fun also make good roast pork.  I know that they make Roast Baby Pig (whole or half) by special order.  They roast turkey for customers during Thankgiving.

The breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea are so so, unless you order BBQ meat with noodle.

5365,1,1546560000000,"All right earlier tonight after driving around we ended up at District One in Las Vegas on Jones just off of Spring Mountain. We decided to give this place another try after a few months. To start we ordered the garlic fries which has fresh crushed garlic and Cajun seasoning. We  ordered the fries well-done extra crispy and they came out soggy I wasn't a fan.  We  ordered the fish tacos which was yellowtail sashimi, Avocado, cilantro, and cherry tomatoes. The tacos were delicious we were  very happy they had a unique wonton taco shell which really made the dish no complaints. Next we ordered the belly buns which was braised pork belly, Cilantro, and peanuts with a typical bun. I was very disappointed with them they need a lot of work, they are average at best. Next we tried the Oxtail  Fried Rice which had Shredded Oxtail meat, red onion, soy sauce and a fried egg. Another disappointment they said it was one of their more popular dishes but failed to deliver amongst our table. Lastly we tried the Vietnamese Beef Carpaccio which consists of beef carpaccio, citrus soy, sesame oil, truffle oil, white onions, basil and peanuts. This was very good, nothing that I would completely rave  about but very good. No complaints I would order it and the tacos again for sure.
Pros: Good food, cool atmosphere, good crowd and they're open late.
Cons: although some of the dishes are good the rest of menu definitely needs some work. They really could be doing better. The staff seemed a little distracted with each other talking and on their phones at times and not really paying attention to a lot of the tables my friends and I had to wait a few times for water and drinks. After ordering appetizers our waiter disappeared for at least 15 minutes before he came back to take our entrée order. Lastly no wifi this is always a bother considering it's 2017 and every business should offer it to their patrons.
We are leaving disappointed for a second time which is very frustrating.
This place has so much potential and they keep dropping the ball. If they step their game up and improve the menu and food quality we would go all the time. As of now they have two strikes against them and I don't want there to be a third. We will give them another chance in a month or so and we will see. As of now they get a C maybe even a C-",3

Usually just the filets are like butter, but believe me, my New York was like cool whip. The staff were fantastic, I believe our waiters name was Patrick... He was so kind and helpful, shoutout to him. We got a few sides and appetizers... We got escargot which was surprisingly good in its garlicky sauce, but I recommend eating with the pastry it comes with. We also ordered the vanilla shrimp which was so plump and fresh and probably some of the best shrimp I've ever had. Our waiter, Patrick, recommended the lobster mashed potatoes, boy was his recommendation on point, it was simply divine. And of course you have to have a green vegetable, so you just couldn't go wrong with steamed broccoli. Then after leisurely eating the main course for about 45 minutes, it was time for dessert... Their specialty is the warm butter cake, which we sadly did not get to experience, instead we devoured the chocolate sin cake. The chocolate was so rich and pure and topped with house made whipped cream and garnished with a mint leaf, but you simply couldn't go wrong with any dessert on the menu. Sadly you can't keep eating all night, it was time to go home with a big doggy bag. Until the next time, I'm sure I won't be disappointed.",2

It was really good.

We were trying to celebrate my friend's birthday, but our server was not very discrete about keeping it a surprise. Also, they charged us for the Japanese cheesecake and candle which I thought was a first for me. Other restaurants don't spoil a birthday surprise nor charge for a birthday dessert.

Other than that, the food was delicious. We first started with oysters ranging from small, medium, and large. It was a good variety and very tasty. Then we just ordered a variety of dishes to share including the Shishito with Cauliflower and Pistachio, Oyster Rockefeller, Deluxe Sashimi Combination that included the Amberjack Crudo, Kim Chi Fried Rice with Pork Belly, and Farm Egg, and the Braised Octopus. My favorite was the Braised Octopus. The dishes were tapas style, therefore, you needed to order a couple of dishes to share with friends.
Also, I think the pairing of my libation (Svetlana - Horseradish Vodka, Lemon, Ginger Syrup, Becherovka) with the oysters was an excellent suggestion from our server.",1

5450,2,1548633600000,"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!",2

There were only a handful of customers and looked like 3 employees. The wait was long for our food, or to get refills it took forever to get her attention. In all honesty I think she was helping in the back because she would disappear for a long time and reappear with someone's food. It really seemed like the staff was missing. The food was just ok but the overall experience was just off and not good.",1

Last night my pizza was just a puddle of grease, its not even edible. Their prices are outrageously expensive for the quality. Its the closest to my house but i think the pizza at the 7-11 is better quality now. This place has really gone down the tubes. Its just not what it used to be. A friend told me the one on S. Buffalo is the real Roccos to go. Something about a bad break up between then two guys. I also spent 18 bux on a veal parm sub. Seems a little pricey for the sub. It was good but not 18 dollar worth good. Their pizza is just a greasefest. It must just be really low end cheese to create that. My recommendation would be to go to Bambinos or East side for quality pizza. If you want really low end stuff that is over priced, come here and get some pizza that just sits out all day.",2

Employees are friendly/polite and quick service. The chips are good and I loved the salsa it was hot but not too hot, bean dip was good. My 1 year old loved his chicken quesadilla. I got the chimi beef steak, it was good but I thought it had to much pepper in it (if that was pepper I taste), the best part of the meal was Rice & Beans so yummy. I'd come here again.",2

As other reviewers have noted, you don't go for ambiance, unless you're in the mood for a retro-70s look (which the place delivers in spades), but keep in mind for $20 (children under 12 pay $10) they have a sumptuous all-you-can-eat buffet with an omelet bar, carvery, salad bar, dessert bar, and steak done the way you want (but you have to ask the server for it). I had prime rib, Eggs Benedict, breakfast sausage, bacon, potato salad, hash browns, and didn't try the mussels in cheese sauce. Would I go back? Yes, but not too soon because of my cholesterol count! :D",2

The views aren't that usually that great from the rooms I've been in, but that's a minor drawback in my opinion. 


All in all, I would recommend the Flamingo to anyone who can't afford the swankiest hotels, but still wants an enjoyable place to stay on the Strip (unlike crap like the Imperial Palace). And the buffet is pretty good!",2

We went here for lunch and I was completely underwhelmed by the choices on the menu and by the food itself. Really? This is what a celebrity chef comes up with? Sad.

Very few choices so you better want a pizza, a club sandwich, or a standard salad. That's it. My daughter had the cheese pizza. I had the club sandwich, which came with fries. And I got a strawberry colada swirl. $60 later, we called that a lunch and left. I could have gotten that anywhere. Why on earth would that be what Wolfgang Puck offered up? Seems crazy to me.

You can jet over to The Palms via the ""sky tube"" which is a very exciting name for something that is actually a moving walkway on the 2nd floor.   Pool closes at 5:00?  In LV during a record heat wave that is not welcome news.  This place seems to be screaming ""I'm sexy!  I'm hip!  I'm where the action happens!"" but it just misses the mark.  Biggest let down was learning that the balconies are sealed off because guests were throwing glass and other debris off said balconies at other guests in the pool.  Let that be a subtle hint to the type of clientele you may have the displeasure of rubbing elbows with during your stay at this establishment.  Plus side:  there is ample parking and the staff was attentive and professional.  If you have a car and a high tolerance for young drunkards, you may enjoy this hotel more than I did.

Residents of East Mesa are eager to have some nice dining options and I think Osteria has potential.  We had the meatball appetizer (which was amazing) and the Pesto, Ravioli, bolognese, and salsiccia (mushroom pizza).  All the food was really good.  We did request a side of red sauce for the ravioli as it is not served with red sauce.  You can taste that the food is made from scratch and everything was really good.  The pizza could have used another minute to crisp the crust a bit more, but was flavorful and delicious.  The wine list is fairly good and the bread and EVOO is good.  We requested balsamic to go along with it and they accommodated our request.  
The service on our second visit was better than the first.  I would request that the servers not refer to me as honey or sweetie.  Others might not overlook this as easily.
I hope that Osteria will continue to work out the kinks.  This is a pricey restaurant for the east valley and although many EV residents are willing to pay for a nice dinner, they will expect great service and food.  I'm hoping that Osteria will expand their limited menu to include a few more seafood and meat selections.",3

The price reflects the small size so no complaints here. We ordered the fried zucchini. On a whim, our waitress told us that the zucchini was hand cut and hand breaded. This made us happy. However, it was actually frozen, beer battered zucchini which is the norm in this bar atmosphere.  :P I ordered the triple decker BLT.  Yummy,  but the toast really tore my mouth up.  Wish I would have ordered the wrap instead. The tomatoes were ripe and juicy. Hubby left half his burger on his plate. It wasn't that something was wrong with it... it was an okay burger.

We always order the Fritto Misto + side of their housemade marinara. 
 This mixture of calamari & rock shrimp is delicious and the marinara is IMHO much better for dipping than the sauce that comes with the dish.   

This time we ordered the 14"" original crust Classic European pizza add meatball (DO THIS!).  Turns out meatball was a fantastic choice and really augmented the rich flavor of this already-delicious pizza.  

We also ordered the 12"" thin crust Wood Fired Yukon Gold + egg pizza to try something new.  It was good but I'd like it better if the whole thing had egg on it instead of just the center.   Kind of reminded us of breakfast.  Glad we tried it but will probably go back to our favorite Pavone Pepperoni again next time. 

One daughter ordered an 8"" Pesto Bianca pizza as well.  She let me have a piece and I'll say it was really, really good.  That pesto and the sundried tomato they put on there is really tasty!   I'd order this again but watch out for those nut allergies - the pesto is walnut based.

If I could dream up a perfect buffet, this would be it - fresh sashimi sliced to order, a few different sushi rolls, snow crab claws prepped and ready to eat, oysters, a couple dim sum dishes, soups (I didn't have room to partake but there were 3 types of noodles and good-looking toppings), salad bar, an entree made to order, and fresh fruit/desserts. Of note, there isn't a HUGE variety compared to your run of the mill Vegas buffets but the quality is much higher.

Absolutely everything I put in my mouth was delicious. What really stood out were the entrees - steak with a homemade mustard for hubby, scallops with artichokes and other veggies for me. The chef is really great with subtle twists and spices added to the food. Fine dining within a buffet - awesome!

They had a large variety of fruit, traditional to more exotic starfruit and fresh lychees. The other desserts were presented as gorgeous little bites, so it's easy to try multiples without wasting. All were good. Another plus, you can order a coffee drink (latte, macchiato, whatever) to go with dessert. Very nice perk, in my opinion.

My wife went with the famous lobster sandwich and I was just glad I didn't order it.  To me, the lobster didn't taste good at all and the with the big price tag on it, I thought it was a disappointment.

We did come back recently to test out the happy hour.  We thought we could try out a wide variety of dishes on the cheap and get a better feel for the place.  On the plus side, I'd go back for $2 14oz drafts all day.  You won't find a better deal than that from what I can tell.  Unfortunately, of all the happy hour items we tried, a majority I wouldn't get again.  Those included the mac and cheese bites, buffalo chicken bites, chicken spring rolls, and short rib sliders.

5723,1,1548547200000,"Back home I use to walk into Carolina Herrera just to smell the store!  The scented candles should be on your high-end luxury gift list for sure!

CH perfume which I have is lovely and also makes a nice gift. It's a sophisticated scent with hints of citrus, rose, bergamot, melon, praline and some woodsy notes, cinnamon and leather at the end gives the fragrance that slight edge. I don't use it daily-perfect for those special classy evenings or daytime boardroom scent.

I seem to come here and buy other people nice gifts.  One year I bought my mother in law a gorgeous purple stone ring then I bought my sister a gorgeous CH handbag, which at first she refused...but it didn't take her long to say, ""Thank you!""

Coming here on this trip looking at all the beautiful bags made me think, ""Why didn't I buy myself a purse?"" But with the $600 pricetag...luxury personal spending is not something this mommy can justify!  Somehow it's easier to spend on those I love.

Lovely designs and bright colors to choose from.  Scented candles, clothes, shoes all fabulous but designer prices can be intimidating...so wait for a sale!",2

The Friday special (king crab cioppino, scallops, mussels, sea bass) was sufficient, creamy and nice. for $27 it is good for one person. And the Goddess Cesar Salad is also testy and creamy, not sure if there is parmesan cheese added. We feel that both courses are a little too heavy in terms of flavor.

There was about 6 customers at 7PM on a Monday night, only taking up 3 stables and a seat at the bar, with two waitresses attending to the people at the tables. So they had no excuses for having such slow service! I ordered the Chicken Provolone Philly and it was as bland as card board. If you want good food with good service, don't go to DB's.

Luckily I remembered I needed to speak to Joe so I found his desk while I proceeded to wait while he was with another customer. When he was done he looked up at me and said ""Are you waiting for me?""  Serious??  How about ""How can I help you sir?""  Probably the worst customer service at a dealership service department that I have ever witnessed. You walk in and everybody ignores you and looks at you like what are you doing here. I witnessed a customer go stand at one of the front counters needing help only to witness HEIDI BURNS ignore her and walk away. The customer then walked to another desk to get help wondering what to do. There were 3 people at desks there who ALL IGNORED HER UNTIL SHE SPOKE UP!  Nobody said ""How can I help you Ma'am?"" What ever happened to pure genuine customer service and caring?  Everybody here works like a zombie. Everybody seems like they hate their job and walks around without a smile.

5835,1,1548806400000,"In searching for someplace new to eat in Vegas, Grimaldi's came up and had pretty good reviews. So, based on the featured ""coal-burning"" oven, it was a must-try.

The place is a pretty cool retro-modern looking, table-and-chair, checkered tablecloth, cloth napkin eatery with available(? we weren't asked if we wanted to sit outside) al fresco seating, open kitchen, and full-service? bar. I liked the ""renewable"" wine bottle chande-lights.

For the three of us, we ordered a Large Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza, a Personal Mushroom pizza, and the Antipasto, which I HAD TO TRY because of the ""house-made"" Fresh Mozzarella. The Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza was pretty good. Good sauce, adequate amount of topping, and a crisp crust, although it did have a somewhat disturbing amount of char on the bottom of it. The mushroom pizza, in my opinion, was a bit scant on one of the most inexpensive of toppings. The Antipasto was quite good, consisting of olives,  oven-roasted red peppers, Genoa salami, fresh mozzarella, and sliced bread. The winner on that plate was the ""house-made"" fresh mozzarella, with the sweet oven-roasted red peppers making a good accompaniment on the sliced bread with the salami and cheese. Oh, and a splash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar (from the leaky bottle)! 

The service could use some work, as our waiter was kinda lost. First, messing up a simple one diet coke, one regular coke, one iced tea order, bringing two regular cokes instead and blaming it on the dispenser. Whuh? And nowhere to be found when we were ready to pay our check. He also screwed up our neighboring tables' pizza order, leaving one of three women sitting there watching her friends eat their pizza while hers was re-ordered. And I don't think they put a rush on it. Having back-of-the-house experience, her order should have been re-made ""on-the-fly"", meaning  it should have been made top priority.

Aside from the little snags, I would definitely go back to try the Caprese salad and some other pizza combinations.",2

The milkshakes are fantastic, and if you mention you'll be sharing one they'll bring it out in two separate glasses, each with their own whipped cream and toppings. This is one of those little things that makes a big difference as it comes to service.

5894,1,1547596800000,"Ugh...really wanted to like this place, but the food is overpriced for the substandard quality.

We met my niece and her fiancée for dinner as they live in the area...and we opted to dine out on the patio, which consisted of wooden picnic tables on a street level patio.

When we arrived, we were seated and our waiter was over shortly thereafter.  I asked if they had lemonade or iced tea. Was told no. Asked if they had diet coke..was told yes. Waiter came back and said they only had coke and sprite. One of my dining companions asked what type of juice they had...and the waiter responded ""orange/mango, or strawberry lemonade"". Um...didn't I ask if they had lemonade? Anyways, it was $4 for something which I drank in about 4 gulps.

We were then told that wine was half price...so one of us ordered a white Pinot. A small glass of white Pinot...half off...came to $8/glass. So normally it would be $16? If that's the case, it's highway robbery.

On to the food.
Person one ordered the ""new"" burger...as its new to the menu. The person who had this said it was ok...but not worth the price. He said the fries were excellent.

Person 2 ordered the fish and chips...it came with coleslaw (according to the menu, their famous coleslaw). The fish was not identified on the menu but he believes it was haddock, a much cheaper cut of fish. The person who had this said it was over battered. 

2 of us had the pasta of the day.....lemon/bacon/onion in a cream sauce. It came with kernels of corn, which I opted not to have and my niece asked for on the side.  I don't think I've ever been so disappointed with a pasta dish in my life. The bacon, while having a nice smokey flavour, was mostly fat, so it was inedible. I could barely taste any hint of lemon....and the portion size was far too small for a $16 price point. The pasta. Fresh though.

Dinner for 4, with the above food items, with 3 glasses of wine (half off), 1 juice, 1 sprite, 6 beers, tax, tip, came to over $160. Completely not worth it. 

All 4 of us, while walking back to our car, agreed we would not be returning.",2
5898,2,1547164800000,"5 stars for the duck poutine pizza in particular just because I think it's something everyone should try at least once in their life. I loved that the pizza was made out of flatbread so it was thin, light, crispy, and didn't feel super doughy or carby. It comes loaded with toppings like fries, caramelized onions, cheese curds, very soft and juicy duck pieces, green onions, and some kind of herb. Honestly it was super rich and flavourful and delicious and is a really unique dish, which is why I would recommend trying it! Definitely consider sharing between 2-3 people though because it is pretty big - I ate half and then thought I was about to fall into a food coma. Price is also reasonable at $18 I think, especially if you split with a few people! 

Also big ups to the service, because the waitress who served us last night was super nice and friendly and added to the good dining experience :)

5951,3,1548460800000,"I LOVE this place.  It's expensive, but it's soooooo worth it.  My husband took me here on our first official date.  We've since been back a few times to celebrate anniversaries and what not's.  Aside from the creepy maitre'd at this location, who later turned into a joke, this was a wonderfully romantic first date place.  I mean come on, I married the guy!

The decor in this location is simple, with an Italian flair and enough elegance to make you think you should dress up.  You don't really have to, but you wouldn't look out of place if you did.  The first time we came here, I ordered the Tortellini Panna Rosa and it was delicious.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the meat filling inside was super tasty.  The rosa sauce was creamy and tangy, providing the perfect complement to the pasta.  Everything was wonderful.

On our second trip back, I ordered the Chicken Fiorentina.  Wow!  It is so good.  The chicken was juicy and tender, but the sauce.  OMG the sauce is incredible.  It is called a cognac cream sauce, but they made as well call it ambrosia.  It's incredibly rich and full bodied with a thick texture that perfectly covers your chicken.  Order that if you ever go there.

The last time I remember going I wanted to get something with that delicious sauce, but I wanted to try something new.  I think I was at the Glendale location, but I can't remember.  It was a seafood pasta with the same sauce and it too was just as wonderful as everything else I have ever had here.

If you want really good Italian food and you can afford to open your wallet a little wider than the average person, go here.  If you want a romantic date, I suggest this location over the others, it's much smaller and more intimate.  A great overall experience that keeps this restaurant in my top 10.",2

Needless to say, we are both adventurous and open-minded foodies...however...we were not too impressed. I ordered the spicy meat combo that had lentils as part of the order. The ""wat"" is meat that is comparable to a spicy beef stew and is served with ""injera"", a spongy version of the Mexican tortilla or a French crepe. At this point, I don't have any other place to conpare this to, but I'm not running back for seconds anytime soon. There was nothing spectacular to wow me.",2

5980,3,1547769600000,"So this place is probably the best soft serve in toronto/mississauga.  

I usually get the large vanilla dipped in chocolate which I think is the best combination.  I've also tried peanut butter dipped.  It's good, just not as good as the chocolate.  Maybe I'm getting older but I think you could go with the medium or small and still be satisfied.  

But overall, this place is consistently great soft serve.  Every year it has the same great taste.  The service is quick and I haven't had any complaints.  I don't interact with them much tho honestly.

I find most soft serve places have really runny ice cream.  I don't know how to describe this place other than good quality

5991,2,1546646400000,"When I walked in to Einstein's today there were quite a few unhappy people gathered around the check out counter speaking in sign language.  I placed my order and sat down and waited and watched and observed two very unhappy couples seated and looking at their watches.  I looked out the window and saw the drive through cars buzzing by with their orders and then observed that in restaurant customers were still waiting and waiting for their food. I spent 20 minutes waiting for my bagels that never came.  Why?  Because the Einstein's employees were catering to the drive through customers and not to the ones that had parked their cars, walked in, picked out their bagel and paid.   They actually sold my bagels twice, once to me and then to a drive through customer. The other two couples that were seated also had their bagels sold out from under them (I talked with them and compared notes!).  The hearing impaired people left after their order for a single bagel finally arrived, it was clear they were unhappy.  I pointed out that this was the second time that my bagel had been oversold by an employee at the store, and all I heard was a ""sorry"".  Seriously, have a system where this can't happen.  In this case, Einstein is a misnomer--there are no geniuses here.",2
5996,3,1547942400000,"I will start by saying that I myself was not at North York General Hospital when a family member of mine went to their Emergency ward late in the evening recently, but I am going to comment on the very poor after-care that we received the next day.

After being examined by a doctor, she was asked if she thought that she should go home or stay overnight. This seems an odd question, as I would think that the doctor should be the one to determine this. She was feeling a little better, so chose to go home, and was given a prescription to fill the next day. When I went to pick-up the prescription the following day, the pharmacist informed me that he could not fill it as it could be harmful for her due to another medication that she takes regularly (which was on the list that she gave to the doctor). The pharmacist attempted several times to contact the hospital to figure out how to proceed, but he was first told to fax over the prescription in question, then was told several more times that someone would look at it but this never seemed to happen. After almost 4-hr of waiting, the pharmacist called again before he closed for the day, and was told that the emergency doctor was not even there that day, but someone else would call him back shortly. Eventually, the doctor that called agreed to send a new prescription for an alternate medication that the pharmacist had to suggest himself. In summary, TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!! The doctor clearly was at fault for prescribing the wrong medication, and nobody else seemed interested enough to correct this mistake.

But a great thanks to the pharmacist who did his best (and I will post a positive review for him at Shoppers Drug Mart - Bayview Village Mall).",2

6014,3,1548288000000,"I really was excited to try this place. Maybe it was the lover of country music in me, the fact I've walked past it's adorably-themed exterior, many times on the strip, or because the words meat and BBQ, ring louder than other food words. Yet, the 3-stars, should have made this Elitist, think again. 
We walked in on an early Saturday night, and was pleased it was just a 10 minute wait. We were told to head to the bar, for a drink if we wanted, while we waited. 
The bar area is pretty cool, with actual saddles for sitting on, tables, a mechancial bull, restrooms, and a large dance floor. We ""saddled"" up to the bar and watched as a busboy and at least 2 bartenders paced back and forth, with no one even greeting us, despite them being slow! No joke, it took over 5 minutes before someone DID take our drink order, and once we received the beer and Cape Cod, the buzzer went off, to be sat for dinner. We headed to our table.
Now, during a meal rush, I don't expect everything to be immaculate, but it was a turn off to literally sit down with a straw wrapper, sugar packet and other table debris, right near/under my feet. I just kicked the crap aside and shook my head. It take 5 seconds with a pooper-scooper, people. Show some pride, in your establishment. 
Our server was ""pleasant,"" but not a happy lass and definitely wanting to get-through the end of her shift. She did point us out to ordering the combo with 2 sides, and splitting it, since we weren't that hungry. My boyfriend and I picked the Tri Tip, Brisket of beef, Creamed Corn, and Green Beans. The green beans were good, the creamed corn was delicious, but packed a kick (if you aren't into spicy dishes), and the meats okay. Despite them being marinated previously, they did need more and I like how there were several sauce bottles to choose from. That always grosses me out though, as I imagine people coughing, sneezing, licking their fingers and then touching the communal, plastic, sauce bottles. The jalapeno cornbread was too dry and flaky. Kinda awkward to eat and continue pinching at, after dissolving from its cupcake liner. It needed a butter and/or honey packet with it. So simple, not to expensive, but would have helped it go down. 
For the price, I likely wouldn't dine there again, but would visit the nightclub part.",2

The restuarant appeared slightly dive-y and quite small, we were seated in a booth by the window that was VERY small. 
They had imported beers for 5$ which is awesome, and we were served a basket of tortilla chips with two types of salsa.
I ordered the enchiladas and a side of refried beans. The beans were served in this cute edible cup which I liked. The enchiladas were decent but the rice was kind of stale tasting.

They were skeptical of what we said. In particular, that any shop would return a car to a customer with a NEW check engine light and not tell them about it. However, after they looked at it, they agreed and were appalled at the condition our car was returned to us. Apparently our car was the talk of the shop because all the mechanics could not believe our car was returned to us in such a way. Breather hoses left unattached, the plug in to the car computer pulled out and left dangling, and every single code on our check engine light a result of something they left undone. I've never had a shop tell me to bill another shop for the work they did, but that's exactly what happened here. DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE. THEY WILL SCREW YOU OVER BIG TIME!!!!-",2

6155,2,1548806400000,Very nice set up. I love seafood. I ordered shrimp & chips. The place only had 2 other tables being serviced at the time. When I received my food it was lukewarm. The shrimp was not fresh.  The price was reasonable. The service was excellent. The server was entertaining. Loved her ! She's the reason for the 3 star it was all about her. If you looking for real seafood this would not be my recommendation.,2

It has a weird old meat taste and the texture doesn't even resemble burger meat. I ate two bites, took out the meat and ate the bread and coleslaw. Unsure of how the menu claims its the #2 seller. Service was friendly but skip the burger and opt for a regular sandwich.",1

What the fuck!!! First did not serve what we order n than rushing to finish, did not expect this kinda behavior from them.

We just had a business dinner for our team at Fran's. We planned the menu ahead of time and it was served family style.  The service was impeccable and the food was out of this world.  Every course was beautifully plated.  The flavor combinations, freshness of ingredients and labor of love came shinning through with every bite.   

There is something for everyone at Fran's.  Her recipes are extra special.  I am passionate about food.  You have to experience it for yourself and you will be hooked.  

I highly recommend calling Fran to cater parties at your home or to host at the restaurant.  There is no other caterer who will care more about delivering the best possible meal for you and your guests.",1
6185,3,1547251200000,"Once again, per my other Indian reviews, this review focuses on the buffet only.  I love Indian buffets for the variety, the price, and the speed at which I can move curry into my stomach.  Samosa Grill is one of the best.

I have been to Samosa Grill several times (I've lost count).  We've enjoyed their normal buffet as well as their seafood buffet.  I strongly recommend both.  The food is always tasty and fresh.  It could do with being spicier, as their buffets are very tame.  This is normal though, as most Indian buffets cater to Western customers who usually don't like it spicy.

You'll find the usual favourites, such as Butter Chicken, unless you go during a seafood night.  I really enjoy the seafood buffet and would suggest going if you want to try something a little bit different.  But Samosa Grill is not without it's problems.

Samosa Grill is one of the many Indian restaurants that serve naan bread to your table and don't include it on the buffet table.  This drives me crazy, as you usually have to wait for it to be made, which can sometimes not come until well into your second helping.  I go to Indian buffets because I don't want to wait, and I'm usually starving.

The other issue is service.  This seems to be common during buffets at even the best Indian restaurants.  It's frustrating.  I've had to order my drink several times, wait patiently for water, and sit around wanting to pay with nobody in sight.  If this was my one and only Indian buffet experience, this review would likely only get 3 stars.  But since poor service has been a common and consistent experience at every Indian restaurant, but one, I have to give 4 stars.  As for that one restaurant that would get 5 stars, sadly they went out of business a few months ago.",2

Their menu has a wide variety of dishes and the portions are huge and the prices are competitive. The food is fast and the service is pretty good, besides the waiters, every now and then the owner will walk by tables and confirm that everyone is doing well, she'll even tell you that her husband is in the back cooking :)

We ordered the corn bread, which was HUGE (enough to share with four people) and came with some onions and jalapenos.  Warm and good (if you like what's inside).  Then we split their rotisserie chicken and their pork ribs.  I'm not a huge fan of pork, or of ribs, but these pork ribs were absolutely delicious.  They slid off the bone with no problem, and they were just the right amount of sweet and with very little fat.  The chicken was also pretty good, but I found it a bit dry.

It would have deserved 5 stars if the chicken was a bit more juicy and if they had a larger menu.  As it was, the menu was a bit limited.",1
6219,3,1546646400000,"My second time, and might be my last.  First time they were only open a couple weeks.  I was the only person in the place and wasn't greeted when I came in. I ordered a slice to dine in.  The employee couldn't have looked less interested in waiting on me.  I almost didn't ask about the baked goods but I wanted a cookie.  She didn't know anything that was in the cases.  I sat down and when she brought my pizza she basically threw it on the table without a word. The pizza was slightly above average as was the tiramisu cookie... So I tried again today.  Very friendly server, but a bit overwhelmed.  I needed 4 cookies and a slice to go.  20 minutes later, its ready, but 2 of the cookies are wrong.  Okay, maybe I miscommunicated so I wanted to buy the other 2 cookies for my friends and the server who is overwhelmed (1 table was leaving with 2 ladies and a single person came in for a slice) told me that the owner would take care of me. I stood at the bakery case for another 5 minutes.  The owner was discussing advertising with 2 gentlemen, so I don't know if he knew I was waiting, but 25 minutes is a little excessive for a quick to go order, so I left.  There are a lot of pizza places that are comparable or better and I can sacrifice having a cookie.  Customer service is important to me and the main reason I am a repeat customer.  Talked to people in the nail salon in the same complex and they said my experience is similar to others they have heard.  Can't say I'd recommend this place to friends and family based on my two visits.",3
6220,1,1547164800000,"Where to begin? I stayed for a week and had so many opinions during that time. I was very impressed on the drive up to the hotel seeing it all lit up and golden - it was all glossy on the outside, but tired looking on the inside.

Cons - Conspiracy to keep you gambling at the hotel.
1. Internet rate of $12.99 for 24 hours PER DEVICE. I used my laptop and my itouch and they double charged me.
2. Food is lousy (expected), but you are so far from everything that there are NO other options in the area, unless you consider Del Taco food.
3. No free shuttle to the strip - also if you try to ask for alternative methods of transportation (other than by taxi) to anywhere, but here you will get unreliable information. Taxi to the strip takes 15 minutes and costs $24-30 PER TRIP ($48-60 roundtrip!).
4.  There were small blood spatters in inconspicuous places - this is the second time that I have noticed this in different hotels.
5. Is all the astroturf really necessary?
6. No nightlife - just gambling
7. Don't assume that the wireless keyboard set on the dresser under the TV actually has a purpose - it does not interface with the TV. Also the ethernet cable for the internet is a wee bit retarded and did not work with the simple plug n go method.

PROS
1. Large rooms for what you pay.
2. 24hr room service that serves decent food quickly.
3. Huge outdoor pool area and large jacuzzi. Astroturf has weeds growing in it.
4. If you're playing in the lobby, you will never have to pay for drinks.
5. Very friendly shuttle bus drivers will give you the inside scoop and will go out of their way to get you as close to the strip for free as they can.
6. If you love NASCAR and horses, then this place is heaven for you.
7. New age BINGO with touch screen or you can play the retro version with the stampers (for an extra fee) - bring your troll dolls and wing glasses.
8. Curved shower curtain rod, blue chlorinated water, telephones everywhere (bedside, desktop, and by the TOILET!).",1
6220,2,1547769600000,The worst cafe food in Las Vegas. Seriously! $5 for a baked potato that has been sitting all day and barely reheated. The inside was light brown...possibly cooked the day before. The pork fried rice obviously had suggest in it. Steve's blood sugar skyrocketed to almost 300 after eating 1/4 of a bowl. I tasted it and told him to stop eating it immediately. I could taste the sugar. $40 later for rice and a potato.,2
6225,1,1547769600000,"The best service I remember getting from a hotel chain in a while. They made our family feel like we were staying with neighbors or close friends instead of in a random sector of Clark County Nevada.

Accessibility:
We checked in at about 6pm after having a buffet lunner at the Rio. It's quite a drive from the Las Vegas strip, and I think considered a different city altogether. (Summerlin, NV?) The check in email will suggest you take 215 to Sahara, and then drive north to around Fort Apache street (if I remember correctly). 

Would not recommend if you're out of town and flying in, as it was a 15 min drive even at 11pm at night. 

Service:
Everyone is so friendly! I consider myself easy going on the level of service I require- Chinese restaurants with rude as hell waiters? No problem if the food is still good! But when the service is good, it definitely enhances everything.

The 6pm front desk clerk (I'm so bad at names, doh) made personable small talk as my dad checked in- how's the drive, what are you in town for, etc. I found it cute how she reminded us twice that they bake fresh cookies nightly at 7pm! About half an hour after check in I ventured out to request extra blankets and toiletries and she laughed and said she'd ""give me the better stuff"" LOL. She handed me a giant stack of Loreal volumizing shamppo/conditioner in lieu of the hotel standard stuff .Well, she definitely had the goods, and it was definitely good shampoo hahaha.

At breakfast the next morning the employee who managed the area was also sweet. She kept the coffee and eggs refilled and also took plates away immediately as people finished. 

The same goes for express checkout. I'm not sure if this is an executive suite only option though, because we were able to choose it but had a suite. This place apparently lets you simply call the front desk with your room number and tell them that you'll be checking out, and just pack up and leave. I dialed for the front desk when we left and a bright young lady immediately quipped ""did you enjoy your stay? Please come back and see us soon! :D :D"" This may be standard for many other hotels but from my limited travel experience she sounded very genuine and made me feel very welcome.

Room Amenities:
As I noted above, our family rented a suite. We were on the first floor in a corner. The suite had a king bed and a sleeper sofa, both of which were rather comfy. It also had an HD tv, which made for a good hour of HD Dodgers game viewing.

A minor to moderate quibble is that the AC and in room fridge sounded like absolute tractor trailers at night, going off at intervals. But eh, hotel appliances, what can you do? No complaints otherwise.

Not sure what I'd be back /for/, but if I do ever need a room in the area again I'd go here. :D",2

There are a few areas outside for walking the dog, but really, just some parking lot medians not a dog friendly area. It was adequate though. They even provided a free poop bag dispenser, for obvious reasons. When they cleaned the room, they even vacuumed the dog's bed. Nice touch. Traveling with pets or not, this is a good location.

Once inside though, any preconceived notions of this Tavern/Sports Bar will be gone. The décor is really nice - lots of dark burly, manly wood and a copper footrest at the bar. A couple of enormous flat screen TVs. Tons of seating indoors and out.

We came here for a little day drinking (it's a real hobby - look it up).  There's plenty on tap and in bottle, including seasonal brews from Birdsong and Triple C.

My friends ordered a bottle of Piper Sonoma knowing that it wasn't cold yet. The bartender worked her magic, with a huge tub of ice, some salt and about 10-15 minutes.

The reason I can't give 4 stars is because jcp always makes me ponder.... Were those knee high boots really $90 and you magically dropped them down to $65?

Even Madmex is a little better even though that seems non-authentic.  I also had a quesadila roja (beef tips, sour cream, lettuce, a single slice of tomato, and mexican rice.  It was tasty but I felt I was still hungry after eating it and I'm pretty petite.

Pretty easy to order, the menu is up and you can decide while waiting in line because that gives you PLENTY of time considering how long the line was.
Choose your cookie, then your ice cream, then toppings (optional but $.50 each), then you can choose whether you want it hot pressed. I highly recommend because who doesn't like a warm cookie?!
I tried a butter pecan ice cream sandwich between a peanut butter and snicker doodle cookie. AMAZING. My boyfriend got a brownie bear bowl with cookie dough ice cream. That was also to die for. I love brownies and that hit the spot!
Only reason I docked a star is because of seating. I hear this place is always busy, but the reason I'm docking is because we went at 10pm at night on a Saturday and there were hardly any settings. We ended up sitting on a bench and let me tell you, it is not easy eating a cookie sandwich on a bench. You need TWO hands for those lol

The way the tables are arranged are a little awkward and close together, but it was no big deal. I love the drink area with the spritzer bar and you can't go wrong with a re-charge station with touch screens! Though I'm not sure I want to touch public screens while eating.

Unfortunately, Sue didn't feel like any were up to her standard to sell, so she just gave us the two dancer lily stems she had, without charge. She cleaned them for us and then wrapped them with beautiful tissue and ribbon. Sue had no idea we were in mourning and has no idea what her gesture meant to the both of us.

6370,3,1548201600000,"111 degrees.  It's One Hundred and Eleven Effing Degrees, and you're in Scottsdale, Arizona, for a meeting.  

It's 111 freaking degrees and you want a little heat in your food but also something refreshing and tasty and a little southwesty.

You are thinking to yourself, Arizona, your first time, they must have some good southwestern, Tex-Mexy type stuff, right?  You've heard they have all sorts of chi-chi (but not Chi Chi's) little restaurants down here to feed and entertain the people who live here in the 111 degree heat with all that money to burn off before they die, right?   Look at all the fancy landscaping and toney zoning controls that keep everything adobe and tasteful;  the food MUST be good, right?  They probably zone for that, too, right?

Well, this is basically Chevy's with money and a little attitude.  It's a Chevy's that's moved to Scottsdale after winning the lottery.  It's enchilada combinations with your beans, your rice, your enchiladas, and yes, all the ingredients are fresh, but it's still just a fancy Chevy's.  It's not like there's a chef back there expressing himself.  What's back there is a Corporation that borrowed the Chevy's concept, tarted it up, slapped it into a faux Mayan ruins via Spanish Colonial burbling fountain super duper atmosphere building, jacked some prices, and made sure there was plenty of tequila behind the bar.

Mind you, I didn't have a Margarita.  It was before the meeting.  If we had stopped after the meeting in the 111 degree heat, after I was all sweaty and relaxed having kicked meeting ass, and I'd ordered a really good Margarita, it's entirely possible I would be singing this place up and down the 202.  It's the Margarita factory, after all.  Which is weird--why would I want a factory-fresh Margarita?  So maybe I wouldn't be singing it's praises.

I frequently eat at Pei Wei, and have eaten at multiple locations without ever having a problem or confusion about ordering gluten free. My fiancé and I visited this location because it was close by, and ordered online to pick up our food. When we showed up, they said they had ""never received our order"", so we ordered our food for eat in instead. I specified with the cashier that my meal was gluten free when ordering, as I have a serious wheat allergy and will be very ill if I eat anything with wheat in it, or cross contaminated with wheat. When the server brought our food, I noticed right away that my chicken looked breaded, and not like the regular gluten free chicken I order. I asked the server to confirm that it was gluten free, because usually GF meals are served on a black plate at all Pei Wei locations (mine was a white plate). The server told me ""oh, we don't do the black plate thing"".. really? Because every other Pei Wei I've been to knows what I'm talking about. I asked him to go and double check that my meal was gluten free, so he goes back to the computer and looks at the order (doesn't ask the chefs) and comes back and tells me ""Yes, it is gluten free"". I take a bite and notice that no, it is obviously not gluten free. I look at the receipt, and my order was not even rang up gluten free! So our server basically made that up (without it saying gluten free on our ticket, order receipt, or asking the chef to confirm), and came back and told us it was anyway. My fiancé then goes and gets the manager (I believe Miranda) who refunded only my food, and not my fiancé's as well, even though we both now have to leave and cannot finish our lunch. She looked at my food and said she wasn't really sure if it was made gluten free or not, and it was never even put on the ticket, but since she didn't know she would just remake it. Then, she proceeded to lecture my fiancé and I was to how you can tell if it's actually GF or not, as if it's our job to know the difference, instead of her staff being educated about how to prepare basic menu items without cross contamination, or even making them with the right ingredients. Maybe if you spent a little time training your staff about proper food handling procedures, you wouldn't have problems like this happen. The entire time we were there, the manager never asked the server about it or asked him what happened, showing she doesn't really care if this happens again or why it was even an issue (he straight up lied to our face because he was too lazy to care or ask someone to double check).

With each table that ordered after us, they were out of something different. First chicken, then beef, then glasses, then small pho bowls.

A friend of mine and I rented a car for an event in Northern Nevada back in late October 2015. Upon our return, I dropped the car off after a look-through in the evening just minutes before they closed. My friend, bless her heart, decided in her unclear mind that she was going to leave her wallet in the side pocket of the passenger side door. Now, mind you, when I had dropped her off at home she was in terrible but hilarious shape. Stumbling-on-air sloshed, I mean truly wrecked. Don't get me wrong, I was the friend and somehow that made me responsible for her and all of her belongings. Sooooo... I get back to the house, unaware of the oblivion I am about to walk into and she's just sobbing, hysterical. Oh man.. I could feel it. This was going to be my fault. After a drawn out, slurred explanation, she says, ""You don't understand. My green card is in there."" OMG. Turns out that she had an appointment to get citizenship in just a couple weeks, a replacement card would take much longer.. You ever tried to gain citizenship without your green card? Me neither, I was born in California. Anyways, the hunt begins. Where did you see it last, when was the last time you had to show your ID, have you used your debit card, etc. Who freaking knows.

I call everywhere. The Northern NV event venue, the bar, the Uber from the day before, everywhere. Because I thought I had checked the car pretty thoroughly, I never thought to even call. Then it dawns on me: my luck? It's in the car. I call Hertz and these guys are so funny. They calm me down cracking jokes and then break the news: the car has already been rented to someone else. HAHA. Anyways, they were able to track down the person renting the car and we were lucky enough to get in contact with the renter ourselves. The people at Hertz were amazing to help us track all this stuff down, did I mention I left my garage door clicker and makeup bag in the car too? Boy, did I feel foolish.

-Service was so bad that I eventually walked to the counter to get the bill and ask for refills myself. Not once, not even twice, but three times.

Overall, that was the worst service I ever received and you could see that other customers were frustrated too. As soon as we sat down, we knew that we just wanted to hurry up and order and get the hell out of there!

Now onto the food. My mom is a vegetarian, and a damn good cook, so I was hoping to surprise her and she was pleased. 

-enoki mushroom balls were amazing
-bbq pork was very good
-har gow and dumpling was DISGUSTING. They put way too much horse radish that I was practically tearing up. In the har gow they put too much bamboo that it was overpowering. They didn't taste anything similar to the real thing at all.
-the sushi was ok.
-menu was all scambled and confusing. For example it would go from apps, to combos to main entrees, to lunch, to tea, to dinner combos. 
-fried rice was good, but way too salty 
-portions were small for the price
-food was warm, it wasn't sizzling hot or fresh, and you could tell. 

Overall I'd never come back here unless it was paid for by someone else and they really wanted me to come.",1

What I like about this bar is that you can order out, get delivery or bring your own food because they don't have a kitchen! So if you get hungry ask them for some delivery/takeout menus!

6511,2,1548547200000,"Decent burgers, really friendly service, and a very basic, straightforward menu.     I was interested in trying this place out after reading all the rave reviews from all over the country so when it finally opened up in Phoenix, I decided to give it a shot.         The burgers are definitely good, done very well, the fries are great tasting too and they give you A LOT of them, if you go and order the ""large fries"" you're going to find a whole paper sack absolutely filled to the brim with them.          


  All in all, Five Guys is a nice place to grab a quick lunch, a little bit on the pricy end for fast food but there is a difference in quality between this place and the McBurgerBarns out there, that's for sure.",2
6512,2,1547769600000,"I came back from Vegas this morning and stayed here. I had no complaints with my room whatsoever. I was very satisfied with my room, I will get to in a minute why I only gave it 3stars.  Well first I stayed on a smoking floor, (25) and I was on the side with a view of Caesars palace. I stayed in a deluxe room. My room was very clean. I saw no sign of cockroaches or I would have check out immediately, The bathroom was clean.  If you want to nit pick the glasses had water spots on them but I didnt use them anyway, but i would have if i needed to.  I got a double bed room even though it was just me and I had booked for one queen, but who cares, the ice machine on my floor was not working but once again, who cares. i mention that because i am a no frills kind of person and some people are really nitpicky and want everything just so and things like these REALLY bother them, me....not so much.  I thought my view was awesome from 25. Standard tv, there was no flat screen, plasma deal going on but i didnt care. now onto why it only got 3 instead of 4 stars.

3 stars: I felt like the powers that be at the flamingo are just assholes about their late check out policy.  When i booked this room back in august i asked about late check out and was told to ask once i checked in. Ok cool no problem.  So I get there, check in and the man tells me i have to call in the morning to request that.  Ok I found this EXTREMELY RETARDED and annoying.  It seems to me that if anyone running this hotel had a speck of common sense, they would know that you are requesting late check out so you can sleep late and not have to worry about getting out of there at 11am, so why would I want to wake up to call downstairs and then go back sleep, everyone isnt like that. I for example am an insomniac and have NEVER been able to just go back to sleep like that. (it was a horrible experience for me and one of the reasons my trip was so horrible having to lug my stuff everywhere). so I get back to my room about 2am and call for a late check out and what is it...a freaking AUTOMATED MACHINE/VOICE, saying sorry we have to late check outs today.  I happen to (thank God because i didnt want to be charged more) wake up at 9:30am and called again and got the same automated voice, couldnt get a live person to save my life so i gave up.

Overall, would i stay here again...probably not but here's why.  Everyone has to go where they are most comfortable, which is why I put in my review the parts about the spots on the glasses, the lack of flat screen because for some people THAT is whats important. For me, I need sleep, that is whats important, so I need to find a hotel that is more accommodating to late check out because THAT is whats important to me. but hell i had such a miserable time in Vegas, i will not be returning to that city for a while hopefully.

ps i was truly miserable in vegas so i was kind of sad to read someone's review saying the flamingo has a natural habitat for Flamingo's that is something i would have LOVED to see and i only saw the pool when i was walking to that wack monorail, it looked nice tho. They should advertise these things a bit more",2

Good enough service to where I definitely want to go back soon and try more burgers or maybe just more sweet potato tots since they were the most amazing sweet potato tots i've ever had. Especially with the marshmallow dipping sauce that you do have to ask for.  They have some pretty good specials on weekdays which is why I would like to return soon so I can become more familiar on what days to be a regular. :)

As far as price, take a look at any of the ""name brand"" hotels and it's not that expensive. Entering our room you feel like you've taken a step back into a time long forgotten. Stone walls that have been there hundreds of years, a beautiful four poster bed, fireplace and non-contemporary furnishings. Its really quite beautiful. The bed was oh so comfortable and we barely made breakfast!

6547,2,1547078400000,"I had not been into the ""old"" Avenue in probably 15 years, so I was excited to go check out the new and improved Avenue Club. My husband and I came early on a Saturday for some pre-football brunch. It wasn't busy, and we were seated on the bar side. I meandered over to the dining side to get a look. Personally, I love the decor.  The waitress shared that they had a lot of asbestos clean-up and obviously they retained what they could of the original structure and decor.  I totally understand people's aversion to change, but in this case, I really think change is a good thing.

There were so many appealing dishes on the brunch menu, but I had to try the Peach Cobbler French Toast. It was delicious!  The toast was cooked perfectly, which is more than I can say for a number of other French toasts I have tried at various Madison restaurants. The topping was sweet, but not sickeningly so. My husband, who perhaps the most unadventurous breakfast eater ever, chose The Standard with eggs, sausage, toast, and potatoes. He enjoyed it all. I wasn't a huge fan of the spices used on the potatoes, but that's such a personal preference that I would never hold it against them!

My favorite part of the experience was right near the end of our meal when a much older couple, decked out in their Badger red, walked in with their cane and walker and sat right in the booth right behind us, which apparently had been reserved for them. I can only imagine (and hope) that perhaps the Avenue keeps tables reserved for the folks who have been coming there for years, which is so incredibly thoughtful and respectful.  I hope that some day my husband and I will be those old Badger fans frequenting our favorite spot and that they will take care of us as well as The Avenue Club appears to be taking care of it's long time regulars.

I can't wait to go back and try some more items on the menu and maybe even bump this up to a 5 star review. :)",2

I then quoted the individual prices for the items that I ordered and he said ""Well, the delivery charge is $2."". I then asked him why the delivery charge on the flyer that they send out says delivery is $1? Oh, ok, he says. He then quotes me a price of $21.01. ?? Where are these prices coming from? I quote him the prices on the flyer again for the items that I ordered and he then says ""Ok, well $20.!!"" Are you even adding this stuff up? If so, why are you constantly going down in price? BECAUSE YOU'RE TRYING TO RIP ME OFF ORIGINALLY WHEN YOU QUOTED YOUR FIRST INFLATED PRICE!! I finally just tell him to forget the order and hang up. Do you think your customers are stupid?

The 2018 Yaris is a vast improvement from the previous models. I looked at the 2017 but found that it was too basic inside. I love my new car. Only $35 to fuel up a full tank of gas.

When I arrived at the shop an hour later, the man behind the counter said he was overwhelmed with iPad repairs and that it would take three days instead of the 90 minutes he quoted on the phone.  The guy would not budge.  Needless to say I did not leave my iPad there and after lying to me they will never get my business.

We did a test drive down the freeway, and because I still wasn't sure if the noise of the soft-top wrangler would bother me, we did another big loop. He offered me a great deal, and I felt like he was on my side. He didn't pressure me to buy the car that day. I returned the next day, and he even helped me check the inventory of other nearby dealerships to see if they had a jeep that was a closer fit to the one I wanted. He was very transparent, and I appreciated that.  

I wasn't a huge fan of the managers I met, or the man who seemed to be rushing me through signing all the paperwork, but I liked Chris, and I love my new jeep!

I use the ""..."" quite often. I like it.
But, Saturday night we finally visited the new Park Rd. Shpg. Ctr. (Charlotte) located business,  ... (Dot, dot, dot.) 
We had paid our membership months ago (only $10!) and had patiently awaited the opening of this private establishment that billed itself as a sort of ""Speakeasy"" atmosphere specializing in classic mixed drinks and tapa-like dishes.
Our excitement was extinguished as we were first told that we would have a 20-30 minute wait (outside), but were then escorted inside immediately to find an extremely LOUD atmosphere. There were 4 of us, so we tried different ""Classic"" drinks. Overpriced for the quality, some were good, but a couple were really bad! (That is their specialty?) We ordered almost every item on the food menu: Arrancini, Tempura veggies, Pork skewers, Charcuterie and Shrimp. Quantities were very small (and we KNOW tapas) and just average flavors. I WILL say that they did a good job with the decor; rich colors, nice lamps, pretty bar and attractive ceiling and wall designs, but our corner booth was too warm and the noise overwhelming. I was expecting white tablecloths, candles, ""Crooner"" music and good food/drinks.

I took a bite into the chicken alone, and had a hard time swallowing it down due to the excessive richness and butter. I threw the entree away after my third bite (I ordered through UberEATS) because all I tasted was cilantro. Cilantro tastes like soap to me, and I would have asked for them to leave it off if it were listed in the ingredients. Worst sandwich I've ever had.
At that point I was thankful that I had ordered the pork face dumplings as well. However, they were served with sriracha rather than a broth/dumpling dipping sauce. All I could taste was sriracha.

First off, the wait on a Saturday was a bit long for a cafe like that, but at the same time, not surprising considering the location. Upon sitting down, they moved us to another table. A bit annoying, but okay since we moved to a more comfortable table.

We ordered the BBQ Pork and Curry Beef Tendons, but both were a bit off. The BBQ was all overcooked, making the meat a bit tough. I personally like my BBQ pork tender with some fat on it, so it was a bit hard to eat. The curry was too sweet, as the balance of flavours was off. With too much sweetness and not even saltiness/spice, it made the curry unbearable. Thankfully, the Milk Tea was quite good, making it the best part of the meal. 

Service wasn't all that great either. I understand working quickly/efficiently to have a faster turnover rate of customers, but you can also be a little nicer. One server was just kinda bitchy when she took our orders.

6719,2,1548806400000,"Alluded to this place in my review of Luxor. Expanding on it here.

Keep in mind I have never been to a spa before so this is a first time experience for me.

We were staying at Luxor so entry to this was only $15. They offered many services like massages and facials but we decided against them. The areas are gendered. Male side had a steam room, sauna, two hot tubs (larger and smaller), cold plunge, locker room, showers, and lounge area. I found out it was clothing optional. Some men are nude. Others are not. But then again it is Vegas.

I was having back issues so the hot tub was SO helpful. The facilities were clean. I felt very relaxed there. Would go back for sure.

I should also add the staff in the front at the register were SUPER nice! Nicest people I had run into so far in Vegas",2

The shrimp was so delicious, I could barely stop myself from eating the whole meal, even though I was stuffed!  The macaroni salad is the best I've ever tasted!  I ordered passionfruit juice in a can as well, and it really hit the spot with my dinner!  We also treated ourselves to a little cup of poi, which was authentically delicious, to the best of my knowledge.

My veggies were hard the meat didn't taste fresh kind of ... Dusty almost, the wontons themselves we're fine but I didn't see much value in the soup at all. 
Sorry Wonton King ... I tried.",2
6730,3,1548720000000,"Super, super noisy.  It's a stand-up kind of place for the most part.  Limited seating and plenty of groups of people creating their own little klatch of clamor that you have to wend your way through to the bar.  

A little confusing about where to walk up and order even though it's a long bar.  I guess that's it...it's a long bar that extends to the entry and you have to figure out how to get in and out.  It's also interesting to see how as your trying to get to the bar and order how the people that have staked their standing space really get an attitude about you trying to get in.  

I'd almost like to see wait service available even if you are a standing group.

Food truck on tap as well as the great assortment of ciders.  They also have a water station set up which is a nice touch.

I'm not sure if they do this or not, but I'd love to just get a couple of growlers of cider and be able to take it away from the bedlam and really relax and enjoy.

Parking is ok but limited.  I'd carpool if you're going to get together with friends.",2

6757,3,1546819200000,"Pretty good food. Been wanting to try this place for some time now and I'm happy I finally got the chance. I was also lucky enough that there were a few tables available so we didn't have to wait at all. Another bonus was how accomodating they were for kids. It was spacious enough to have a stroller go through and they even had high chairs available. The staff were all very friendly and knowledgable of the menu and could provide feedback when questioned.
Their chicken was very moist and flavourful. Although, the chicken on my dish was a lot saltier then the fried chicken in another dish. But the flavour combos were very delicious. The portions were huge in my opinion as guests from my party were unable to finish their meals and some had to pack some up. Their mashed potatoes were very good and the poutine upgrade was definitely worth it. BONUS - their gravy is vegan and very delicious at that (coming from an everything eater). I'd come back for sure but know now to share dishes versus trying to finish one on my own. HA",2

6773,1,1546819200000,"If I didn't have a Wonton Chai Noodle by my house, I may have found this place to be delicious. However, it definitely pales in comparison to Wonton Chai!

The prices are cheaper by approximately $0.50, and the noodles are noticeably thinner. However, they're also not cooked as al dente and, although not very mushy, definitely lack the springy bite characteristic of Wonton Chai. At the same time, their broth is not as rich and may contain MSG (having consumed about half the bowl of soup, my mom became quite thirsty). Moreover, there is some alkaline taste to the noodles - although this is very slight and minimal. Finally, the portions are smaller - and an extra $1 provides two toppings but there's only one extra topping given, whereas Wonton Chai Noodle offers the same additional portion for an extra $0.50 only.

On the other hand, I didn't find their broth to be as salty. The dace fish balls were also not as salty, and the wontons were very tasty as well! I have slight gluten sensitivity, but wasn't very affected by Jim Chai Kee. 
 
Overall, a decent place, and I liked it! However, it's just that when compared with Wonton Chai, my family enjoys Wonton Chai more.",2

6778,1,1548374400000,"I haven't been to this airport since college. After moving out west, nothing compares to LAX. With that being said... from the moment I touched down to when I left was an easy process. Everything was labeled accordingly. The TSA's & workers were quite friendly. I was even driven in one of those golf carts to the baggage claim by an employee. Some random guy working as a janitor remembered me from my football days. He even called me by my last name and that made me feel really good. The airport has tons of places to eat and dine. I've taken a few pictures for reference. There are places here that the west coast doesn't have which can be kinda cool if you want to experience something different. Obtaining a rental car is fairly easy. Trams/shuttle service available to take you places just like any other airport. Parking seems not to be an issue due to the population differences I'm assuming. Pretty clean airport, nothing bad to say. Just a 3 because there was alot of construction going on in the front were pick up/ baggage claim was. Plus it's sorta basic and nothing jumps out at you here. Maybe I'll change my star rating once I depart next week since it'll be a different process.",2
6779,1,1546819200000,"Great food and value

Visited with employees to celebrate one's birthday. We all opted for bentos and it's amazing how much food you get for the money.  We all waddled away content... once we managed to pry ourselves from our chairs.

Tomo's has the usual variety of bento options-- all have some tempura and a ginger-dressing salad, some maki sushi, and meat options. Our group had the A, B, C, and E.  They offer one of the best bentos around and the sushi was surprisingly good.  I'm used to very hit-and-miss experiences with sushi in the Valley.  Truthfully, much more miss.

I also compelled the young men to sing Happy Birthday to our birthday boy. You could tell it wasn't their thing, but they didn't hesitate to give it a go.  It was a sad, off key rendition by all of us at the table.  Not a lick of harmony, but scored a 25% tip for earnest effort and fried ice cream with delicately placed candles!

Will be back to try, again.",2

I hope all my future experiences here are just as good as today! :)",2
6797,3,1548201600000,"I live in the Ballantyne area and rented from this location since 2000 - so I think I can speak to their history. Back in the early 2000s I thought this location was staffed by employees who walked on water - I rented regularly and they treated me extraordinarily well. On-time pickups, short waits for drop off, etc. Over the years my job has evolved and I don't have to travel/rent as much. I've tried to remain loyal to this location, but I'm at the point where I can't remain loyal any longer and I'd really struggle to find  much positive. 

Enterprise uses the tagline ""We'll pick you up"" except for when they won't. I've lived in my current home since 2003. The Pineville location has picked me up at this address without any issues in the past - I reserved a car, called them an hour or so before I wanted a pickup... clockwork. In the past year or so, I've started running into issues. I'll reserve, call, get a ride, and they won't have my car. I'll reserve, call, and be told ""we're too busy to pick you up."" Or ""We can't pick you up this morning, but can pick you up this afternoon."" Or ""We're too busy you should call another location and see if they can help you."" etc. So, being a relatively loyal client, I asked ""what do I need to do to make sure that I get picked up?"" I was told - ""Be sure to call a couple of days in advance so that we can put your on our pickup list."" So I tried that today, now I'm told that I'm more than 3 miles away (7.4 m door-to-door) and thus they can't pick me up. You might note if you go to Enterprise.com, their policy is the nearest branch with availability within 10 miles will pick you up. I've got 5 locations within 10 miles that show up on the website AND Pineville is the one their website defaults to for me... I especially loved calling their number and being told I should just get an ""Uber or something"". If I wanted to take an Uber to get a car, why the heck would I choose Enterprise? At least with some of the other vendors, I'd actually get the car type I reserved, it would be relatively clean, and they would hand me the keys with it on full-tank of gas (vs. waiting forever to be handed keys with the empty light on and the out-of-range light flashing. Yep, that happened!) 

I haven't even started down the path of the kinds of issues I've run into while waiting for rentals and/or returning rentals - I'll not bore you. At the end of the day, if you end up using this location, I sincerely hope your experience(s) are better than mine.",2

I was pleased to see the Mac & Cheese and Baked Brie appetizers come out quickly (remember, hangry). I pride myself on making an amazing Mac & Cheese but this one blew my mind. I don't know what magnificent witchcraft they're performing in that kitchen but I'm HOOKED.

The last few years, especially summers, I would be here at least once a week; and anytime my friends from out of town would come, I'd take them here because they couldn't wait to come back. The service is usual fine, giving the high popularity and associated longer wait times. However, I give a 3 Star review today because of the menu change. The chicken, which has always been the most amazing part for me has been tweaked to be of a lesser degree in my opinion. My enjoyed Widow shell is gone, replaced with a redundant stoner shell with bacon. The chili spiced sirloin was fine, but still not as good as the sirloin. My girlfriend LOVED the shrimp tacos, however the shrimp flavor has also changed to a jalapeño version to which she is not amenable, and stated that the fish of the day taco was ""fine."" As long time advocates and patrons of the Lakewood, Tremont, and downtown Barrios, this visit is the first that has not left us longing to come back when less full again.

The tech didn't introduce himself (I finally shoehorned his name out if him which was Alex), already had a solution in mind without assessing the issue properly or listening to what I was explaining to him the symptoms, finally he was very rude and attempted to speak down to me and talk over me.  One of the first things he said was well if I take this pipe off the water will go all over the floor....  My response was simple.  ""Your a plumber and didn't bring a bucket with you??""  From that point on he did everything he could to not work in my home.  In fact I think even if he decided to begin work on the issue, I don't know if I wanted him to since i really didn't have the confidence in him that he knows what he was talking about.

My friends and I waited for over ten minutes - no menus. No water. No server. No SERVICE. and it's really not that busy. The server in the section looked absolutely miserable and didn't acknowledge us once until after the manager came over (35 mins after already sitting there and ordering drinks off a bus boy - who forgot and I ended up just ordering from the bar) The manager then forgot our second round of drinks - remembering once we waved him down. 
The food ... not up to O&B standard .. calamari tasted like frozen calamari .. the tacos were (in lack of better terms) slop. And the wings and crab cakes .. they were ""alright"".

Oh, and the owner (sorry forgot his name) gave me a ride back to my hotel. 

90 minutes later they came back to the hotel with the car done. It looked 100% better and no hassle at the rental car agency.

Sadly, I had the same experience with employees that many other people had. They would be off in areas that customers are obviously not supposed to be in. I like to be generally left alone when shopping, but appreciate a greeting and being asked at least once if I am looking for anything in particular.

7081,1,1546387200000,"This is Nook's second location, located within the Hilton Garden Inn in Downtown Phoenix on Monroe Street. I originally reviewed their Indian School spot and gave them a solid three stars due to having respectable but somewhat pricey foods, with lots of hits and misses with their menu. And honestly, in terms of the overall experience, I'd say that this location is more or less the same. The restaurant itself has a cool setup and unlike the spot on Indian School, also features an outdoor patio. 

We started with a half-order of their fig bruschetta, which includes fig jam, prosciutto, asparagus, and a bit of goat cheese. This item has always been consistently good, while their polpetinne (fried risotto balls) were fine as well.

We've experimented with their menu before by trying their bolognese and being disappointed. I assume their chicken marsala is still very good, while I'd imagine that their poutine (gravy fries) also delivers. We decided to skip these options, however, and just get a diavolo pizza.

Nook's pizza is a bit weird. Ingredients are fine and crust has always had solid flavor, but their pizzas are always served incredibly dry and floury, in stark contrast to what we're used to at most places. I guess it's more of a subjective thing, but I never find myself to be impressed as much as I wish I could be.

For dessert, their options are a bit different than what we remembered. We decided to order their buttercake, which seemed more like a cheesecake than anything else. The dish heavily incorporates graham crackers, including a ganache and an actual miniature graham cracker itself. The dessert was good, but if you're familiar with buttercake, you might be a little thrown off.

Our server was incredibly slow - and I mean painfully slow in comparison to the usual quick service we receive at Nook. The place wasn't very busy for a Saturday night, so I'm not sure what that was about.

Prices are a bit high, which I've never felt are fully justified. Overall, I'd still recommend Nook as a place to try out. Although the food isn't quite as impressive as I think it could potentially be, it definitely has its fair share of fans.",1
7087,2,1546905600000,I've come here very often and in the past it was great and I loved it but it seems like things have changed a lot.

7089,1,1548374400000,"I've only really looked through the video games and music. There is a large selection of newer video games, but not so much for old cartridge based games. As I've noticed recently in many video game stores the old school games are locked in a case, with prices hidden. I find that annoying. The record selection is ok, but they are not organized, and are in sealed plastic sleeves. This means if you want to check the condition, you must first peel the flap back to slide the record out. You also need to be careful not to get the jacket or inner paper sleeve caught on the sticky part of the plastic sleeve or else you can damage the item. I was also not impressed with the pricing of the records. Way overpriced.

First of all, when I was originally going to ask for help, she was the first in sight, but she immediately ducked away and avoided eye contact, so I went to the cashier and asked for help with pick out the goldfish that I wanted. Well guess who came to my help... the First Lady... She looked totally unwilling and was even having arguments on her headset and laughing. This isn't so much the part I'm upset about. What irked me was the way she handled the fish. MY FISH. She scooped out the first fantailed goldfish in a fast swoop, then when she got to the second (a black moor) she ended up pinning him between the net and glass, pinching the left side of his tail fin. Now it has a sag... which it didn't have before. Roughly tossed them in the bad and was sloshing them around when writing the sku. I kept quiet the whole time as the fish were still in her hands and not yet my fish. Fancy goldfish are slow swimmers. The fins in fish are also a bit delicate. None of this was needed. I wish I knew her name. I'm so glad I got these guys out of there, but can only imagine how else they've been treated. That person is bringing down the rep of the store.

Non yelping friends have been talking about this place for months so we decided to join them on a Wednesday night for some Philly cheese steaks.  JVG is located inside of the MR G's bar and grill on the corner of Sandhill and Desert Inn. Mr G's is an old school dark divey hole in the wall type of setting with a grill operated by JVG. Upon arriving and seating in a very uncomfortable booth we were quickly greeted by John whom we told we were waiting for two more to arrive.  After sitting for a few minutes we realized that you had to venture to the bar to buy your drinks.  So we opted for the $8 pitcher of Bud Light.  Once our friends arrived John realized they were regulars and greeted them by name.  He advised that the menu was out dated and they no longer had a few of the items. We ordered all the fried goodies and cheese steaks and ate away.  The food was great and the service by John was top notch.  I can't wait to try a JVG burger and the Italian sub on our future visits as we have added this place to our list of Fav's.
 If you have a problem with smoke Do not complain as this place allows smoking in the bar and while we have no problem with it I am sure you will read in the reviews people complain about it.  They have a couple pool tables we might take advantage of next time for some added fun with our fantastic food.  They seem to do a heavy take out and delivery, so, give it a try.

The salad I had had a metal brush thread innit and when identified to the employee, she brought it to her manager who never even bothered to come talk to me. I have given this place many chances and the only thing that is consistent is it fails miserably to impress me. Especially when the employees empty out the iced coffee in front of me for their own consumption and then just walk away with it empty. I had to ask to have more made. And when they made more, my meal was done. If I owned this place a major change in management would occur quickly to maintain the customer base I can maintain. Very disappointing!",3
7185,2,1548806400000,"I've been to Lee Cafe twice. The first time was just for lunch and I ordered off of their regular combo menu. The garlic chicken was very good and the sauce was light and did not seem to contain tons of corn starch like most Chinese places. 

On my latest visit for dinner with my dinner group, we ordered a bit of everything from the traditional menu.  For appetizers the Szechuan Wontons were amazing! I couldn't get enough of the sauce. The tempura shrimp was also good as well as the steamed dumplings.

For entrees we shared the chili chicken, Szechuan beef, salt and pepper tofu, a pork dish and a triple protein dish whose names I cannot remember. The highlight for me was the chili chicken. It can smothered in chilies but the sliced ginger is what made it phenomenal.  The tofu was the surprise! It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. 

The staff here is amazing, very friendly and spot on service wise.  Prices are very affordable for huge portions.

This has now become my favorite Chinese restaurant I the Charlotte area!",2
7188,1,1547942400000,"Took my gf here this past weekend for a nice little dinner in Vegas. The worst part of this restaurant experience is finding it- we walked around the casino for 10 minutes trying to locate it, but after asking 2 employees where it was, we finally found out it was right near the main entrance to the Venetian (which we had entered from 10 minutes prior), tucked away to the right of the check-in desk and up 10 floors in the suites tower. 

Once we got there it was a great experience. I can't say how much of Thomas Keller's influence is on this place (he obviously does not cook there, and we're still planning a FL visit) but if he had any effect whatsoever, it had to have been good. 

The restaurant has a casual yet elegant feel, and the service was impeccable and not in any way obtrusive. That's exactly the service I like- help us out when service is needed, but stay out of the way for the most part. Dishes were promptly cleared, water was filled at just the right intervals, and the pacing of the food was on point. Our waiter was informative but not pushy.

We started off with the parsnip soup and mac and cheese side, which were both excellent. I choose the roasted chicken based on our waiter's recommendation and my gf had the steak and frites (basically a really nice version of steak with fries on top). Her steak was one of the better steaks we've had in a restaurant, and we've had alot. The chicken was tender, moist, with just the right amount of seasoning on the crispy skin. 

I was pleasantly surprised with the portion size, we couldn't make it to dessert because we were so full off of our appetizers/entrees. We probably could have done without even one of the entrees and still would have been full. I actually felt a little sluggish after, but I don't think I'm used to all that butter and cream in my diet. It's definitely worth unbuttoning your pants for though.",1

The queso is slimy and generic. Overall, there is nothing worthwhile about the food. The only time I eat it is when it is getting late and I need to grab something quick, because there is a Panchero's right near my house and they are open until 11pm.

I placed my order to go yesterday. I had the pick two combo for $7.99: Italian wedding soup and 1/2 of a prime rib sandwich. The Italian wedding soup was delicious and was perfect for this cold weather. The prime rib sandwich was probably a 2* item. The meat was good but they've got a horse radish spread that wasn't very good. I think they could make it into a french dip sandwich or give a small container of au jus sauce to complement the sandwich.

Cons: no mini-bar, fridge, or other amenities; only one chair; a couple of broken lamps, and shower curtain rod broke while we were there. I did like the workout room and spa, but do NOT visit the salon (Uno) as they're rip-off artists. The rest of the hotel -- casino, stores, restaurants, etc. -- were all fine but not great.

Two kids spaghetti and meatballs was disappointing. Noodles were cooked fine, the meatballs were small and bland, and the sauce was runny and wasn't nearly enough to coat half the noodles let alone the entire plate. And for $6 each that's ridiculous. 


We order the Mama's Supreme pizza. The order took well over 30 min for the pizza. Half the crust was burnt. The toppings were limited and the flavor was blah.

Mushrooms or spinach, 15?? I have been eating prime rib at the place in NYC since I was a child. When I found out that this location had no prime rib and was given a business lecture to explain why, I should have left. But I wanted to give it a try. Today, steak is all over Las Vegas, so it really boils down to personal test. These over-the-top marvels of the modern meat-lovers havens are sometimes more show than go.",2

Stage 1.  (The Kevin Bacon). 2+ beers.  A couple beers in my feet start twitching and I get the sudden urge to hit the dance floor.  Footloose just got unleashed!  People are eyeballing but I tell myself they are just jealous.
Stage 2.  (The John Travolta). 4+ beers.  Yeah I'm feeling the Saturday Night Fever kicking in hard.  I can't be stopped.  The people previously staring are now trying to compete!  It's on!
Stage 3.  (The Patrick Swayze).  7-8 beers.  Sweat, bodies bumping, my wife getting me all hot and bothered and now I'm Dirty Dancing to Hip Hop, 90's Pop!????  Wtf!  I'm losing my groove but can't figure it out!  
Stage 4.  (Back to Old John Travolta). ???  Beers.  At this point I'm trying to Stay Alive.  My body is not in coordination with my mind and I'm doing some crazy moves I may or may not realize are happening.  I didn't fall!  I'm inspecting the dance floor people!

Plenty of tables for seating.  Multiple bars, outdoor relaxation area and not far from public parking or a parking garage.  When the bands break, we head down the street and check the other locales.

We stopped in for lunch today, and made it in a little before the typical lunch rush. I went with their three cheese melt and a cup of their spicy crab soup. It was perfect for a chilly December day in Charlotte. Do not be alarmed by the ""spicy"" in their crab soup, it really is more a subtle heat, and I am one that is a wuss when it comes to spicy foods, and I gobbled it up! It really is a very mild spice that just warms you up right along with the rest of the soup. The chunks of crab in here let you know the soup is the real deal too! Simply delicious! 

My husband went with the burger and pasta salad. I had a little bit of plate envy when I saw the size of the burger, and totally stole some pasta salad. Ask your server for some of their house vinegrette to put on the pasta salad, if they don't bring it out already. It's good!",2

They have a good selection on their menu but it's seriously overpriced... Yes the food is good but I don't think it's worthy of its high price tag. I ordered the albacore tuna which was really nice and light. My friend got the vegetable Samosa which was so so. It definitely was not a traditional samosa since the skin looked different. The atmosphere was nice and not too loud so I didn't have to strain to hear what my friend was saying.

We ended up dining at STRIPSTEAK and Bouchon for our main dinners, and STRIPSTEAK took a notable second place for me out of those two experiences. The food is delicious and the service is great -- there's not a question there. I had the tuna and it was cooked to perfection. My fiancé had the bone-in ribeye and seemed to be in heaven. We split the bleu cheese scalloped potatoes as a side and started with the hamachi poppers, both of which were exceptional. Aside from that, we each had a couple of cocktails and noshed on their complimentary trio of fries (the truffle fries and aioli -- nom!). Still, we somehow managed to tally up quite the bill, which is where my uncertainty lies. Around $230 for the two of us. Again, no wine. Just a couple of cocktails each (sub-$15). We did have a restaurant.com gift certificate which helped, but we were still both a little surprised by the cost of the meal. It was good, but not so memorable where it was worth that investment (at least not in my book). 

The ambiance wasn't totally what I expected either. I was expecting something a bit more Bouchon-esque (a little more closed off, dark wood, etc.), but instead the space was pretty modern and open. It's a place that you could go on a date just as easily as you could make it a guys night out. Not overly intimate in its surroundings, though still very nice.

All in all, I thought it was a very good meal. Not exceptional, and -- for me -- not worth the cost when there are so many other exceptional restaurants offering something bit more unique and equally delicious for the same price point. Still, I'm happy that I've checked a Michael Mina restaurant off the list. I just think I'd have been happier giving that money to Bobby Flay at Mesa Grill. :)",2

I went in for a trim, nothing dramatic (I'm going through the slow burn of growing out a pixie cut). Tomomi and I were the only two people there, she gave me a good hair wash and cut, but what really stood out was that I had mentioned I'm not good with styling hair (that was the reason I had it short for so long) and after the cut she took the time to show me how to put waves in my hair with a curler and gave me suggestions on how I could style it with accessories and pins for fancier occasions.

The second time I went in, I requested Tomomi again for another quick trim (same deal as before, just making sure I looked neat while I grow out my hair). The salon was a lot busier on this visit, but Tomomi still took the time at the end to show me another simple way to style my hair -this time with straighteners.

Lots of toppings to choose from but does not necessary mean to chose them all. One tip, keep it simple and neat. You want to be able to taste the burrito and not a whole bunch of different toppings.

7389,2,1548288000000,Never shopping there again after two recent terrible experiences. First was an employee wouldn't let a mom in front of me in line exchange a pair of kids shoes for a smaller size. She didn't have a receipt but all she was asking to do was get a smaller size. She ended up leaving in tears and the employee did nothing to help her. Second experience was we bought a lawn mower in 2014 and got the extended 3 year warranty. The sales associate assured us that if we canceled within the 3 year time frame we would get 100% of the warranty price back. Well here it is almost 3 years later and Sears will only refund $44 of the $249 price of the warranty. So the sales associate just lied to our face and management will do nothing to refund the full $249. Never shopping here again.,2

We needed a new mattress and I was concerned about the pressures put on by salespeople but stopping in Best Mattress was different.  Best Mattress was the 1st place we stopped and Brian, the new store manager, was there to greet us. He welcomed us, asked us what we were looking for, and showed us what we wanted (WITH NO PRESSURE).  We had not bought a mattress in a decade and were unfamiliar with the new technology was and Brian was very happy to tell us all about his products he had. In the end, we liked a mattress but wanted to see one other brand that he didn't have and Brian didn't try to make us buy before we walked out of the door.  We worked out the details of our deal and I told him I would be back the next day and we stood by our word.  Overall, Best Mattress had great deals right off the top and they had a great sale going on at the time we purchased. I recommend this place to anyone buying a new mattress.  Also, we needed the mistress delivered and they offered delivery for next day and will take away our old mattress.  Thanks Brian for your great salesmanship on this sale.  We will come back!",2

We went in and I swear the guy at the door looked at us like he didn't know what we were doing there. I had to explain to him that we needed a table so we could eat. So beyond odd. He looked irritated but sat us down. Food was bland. Alfredo sauce tasted very watered down and their bread is like bread cake or something. Very different. WAY too expensive for bland food. It's a cute place but there's a reason it's so quiet. Oh, and some older lady (Assuming the owner) kept walking by and just staring at us.

And it is topped with rainbow sprinkles, caramel popcorn and a pocky stick to hold the cotton candy on top, serious sugar overload. It is really large and good to share. 

They close quite early though, I have tried multiple times to go here but they are either closed or closed by the time I got there. The staff was alright, not super friendly and I asked about their social media discount on their in-store chalkboard and no one seemed to know about it.

He gladly took my Groupon information, logged all of my clothes, inspected each piece for any stains or areas that would require more attention and sent me on my way.

I wish I can say I got an estimate so I could have an idea of how long things usually take here. He tried to give me one but I told him I'd be back in on Wednesday (it was Thursday).

Fast forward- I went in early on Monday (three days later) to see if my things were ready as I wanted to do a last minute skiing trip and my skii clothes were there. They were ready, and while it was a different lady behind the counter she was just as friendly and helpful! I had about 11 items, some of them bulky, most of them silk, a little wool.

I have finally found a spot (without having to drive to Scottsdale)  where I can get a truly wonderful Old Fashioned with a large block ice cube.  The décor is awesome, hip and elegant with beautiful lighting.  They have a very long wooden bar that I haven't been able to move past so I can't really comment on the dining room. 

I am not sure why everyone keeps mentioning small portions... I have had several dishes and I didn't think they were small. Quite frankly I think Americans are overfed and used to large portions that could easily feed 3 people from one plate. Either way I ordered the ham steak and eggs and my friend got the KFC Sandwich and they were both HUMONGOUS!  In fact the ham steak  was the size of the entire plate!

2 pound lobster tail stuffed with crab and shrimp - excellent - I thought they would over cook it but it was perfect and extremely juicy. 

We also had a special steak topped with gorgonzola cheese that was amazing (I think the steak was almost 2 pounds) - medium rare.

7577,2,1546905600000,"As you wander down King Street- you might miss the decorative scroll work that is the entrance way to Patria- a wonderful restaurant tucked away behind another building that serves authentic Spanish Tapas in a contemporary, thoughtful environment.

It is here that no detail goes unnoticed . . .from the interesting wall art that frames the wall by the stairs, to the marble bar to the copper accents and even the narrow restrooms with beautiful appointments- this place is a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.  And it is almost like two restaurants for there is an energy and noise level inside the restaurant that is totally opposite from the serenity that you might find with a table on the patio.

We sat outside and had just a wonderful time.  Our server, Leticia and the manager, David, went out of their way to make sure that everything was just perfect on this visit . . . .and it was.  We started with some of their sangria as well as drinks off their specialty cocktail menu.  We were very happy with Leticia's suggestion of a full bodied wine as we were less familiar with the Spanish choices on the menu . . .so much so that we drank two bottles of it!

The food is tapas and meant for sharing so leave the quantity of how much to order to your servers as they will not steer you wrong.  We ordered what sounded like a lot of food- but it ended up being just perfect.

So on to the food- know that if you want one of the three paella's- they do take 45 minutes to prepare so be sure to order it with your other choices.  We started with the Pan Con Tomate with ham which was really good.  Next up the bacon wrapped dates and the croquettes with manchango cheese . . . also quite good.  One of the specials on the day we were here was the grilled Spanish octopus which was probably my favorite served over a crispy slice of potato.

And then the Paella arrived.  We went with the meat version (there is also a veggie and a seafood version) but all three sounded amazing.  The Paella de carne mixta came with duck, pork rib and chorizo and was rich and decadent.  The rice absorbs the flavors of the meats along with the tomatoes and creates a richness that you can taste the second it goes in your mouth.

As for dessert- we tried some of the more odd sounding choices although the chocolate pudding with sea salt is purported to be their best seller.  Thinking we could get that most places- we chose to go with the fried milk and saffron ice cream (kind of like a deep fried flan) which I really liked although my dining companions didn't like the texture.  Our other choice was a combination of coffee ice cream with black olive marmalade (who comes up with these combinations?) served between slices of a nut wafer.  Certainly one of the most interesting flavor combinations I have had in a while.

A wonderful evening with friends was made even more special with great service, outstanding food and an ambiance that had you second guessing where you were . .the streets of Barcelona, perhaps?

All in all a great choice for a great night out!",2

You can order off the menu, which features steaks and seafood.  Otherwise, what people usually get, is a cut of prime rib.  We started with a house salad that they coin as a spinning salad or something.  The just make it table side with a heavy hand with dressing.  It's okay but it's pretty salty and not ""light"".  But that comes with the meal anyways.  The prime rib also includes mashed potatoes and you can add other sides like creamed spinach, buttered peas, or creamed corn for extra.  I tried the potatoes, spinach, and the creamed corn off of someone else's plate.  The creamed corn was just a lot of corn in a lot of cream.  It was okay but nothing to write home about.  Cream of spinach was heavy so I could only have a couple of bites, but it tasted alright.  Potatoes were good, all the sides were just run of the mill and rich.  The Prime rib was really tender and the au jus was really yummy.  My friend and I split the Lawry's bowl cut (the really large piece) and that worked well, with left overs to take home even.  They let you choose how you want the piece to be cooked and carve it at the table for you.  They also include a little bit of yorkshire pudding that is pretty good.  Just save room for it because they served it to us after we already ate half the meal.  I wish I was hungrier.

My mother was sitting RIGHT THERE. In another situation, I may have brushed it off as not-so-tasteful humor, however, as the night went on she continued to give my mother short replies when she was not ignoring her altogether. There were a number of errors regarding our meals - for as much as the waitress seemed to like my dad, she completely FORGOT to bring his food. Additionally, my fiancee's food was ice cold and my mom's was lackluster. I barely ate mine because of the already astounding level of frustration that was building. While my fiancee had to send his plate back (putting it in the hands of a surly gentleman, who I later found out is the OWNER), my father's arrived and his too was cold - I don't mean lukewarm, I mean like it came straight out of the fridge. To top it all off, when my father spoke to the owner, this man actually WALKED AWAY. Out of frustration, my father left the table and sat outside while we got boxes for our meals. Enter rude owner who stated, ""I know you guys don't have time, so the meal is on me tonight."" TOTALLY MISSED THE MARK. As he walked away, I was sure to loudly state we were not short on time, but sick of this atrocious service. My mother again called for the owner to inform him of the severity of the events of the night. This man had the nerve to laugh in my mother's face and did not apologize until she told him he had not previously done so.

We had an appetizer, a dish of vegetables, and an order of seafood dumplings. The taste of the appetizer was a bit plain so we asked the server to add more spice to enhance the flavour. Overall, it tastes pretty refreshing in the summertime because of the mix of the cucumber and parsley. The dish of assorted vegetables was very favourable. The potato and eggplants were well cooked, so soft and easy to chew. The sauce was well permeated through each slice of vegetables. Last but not the least, the dumplings were better. The stuffing was made by shrimps. It at last tastes fresh. The skin was still thick but was more softener than before. 

In the past, I would've given a 1-star, but this time, I gave them an average rating.",3

My boyfriend ordered the Pistachio crusted  salmon, which he described as flavorless and that the salmon tasted like a greasy piece of fish with some pistachios thrown on top. I believe it was like $13 or 14.99. My salad was small, and oddly enough it came with a freakin muffin? Not to mention the muffin was the BEST thing i tasted in there....sad,but true, the blackened chicken was the smallest little diced cubed up chicken pieces i have EVER seen, it didn't even taste as if it was blackened. The greens were wilted, and usually a $12 salad anywhere ya go is a good salad with a nice pieces of chicken cutlet, and our server was trying her  best, but came off as annoying to us unfortunately. We also ordered the appetizer of the crab fritters, i think like $5.99- and it was not great, the crab tasted old....This came off as one of those restaurants that want merely nothing but your money, the food isn't authentic whatsoever and the servers look as if they could care less..I will never be coming back to this place",2
7652,1,1546905600000,"Since moving to Toronto I have felt like a fish out of water in regards to haircuts and salons, I was always floundering around in search of an adequate stylist. I kept coming across Parlour at Ossington and Queen on yelp and whilst researching salons. It opened around the time I moved into my old neighborhood of Little Italy, and the salon's pretty and delicate website featuring photographs of stylists decked out in tattoos, sporting wicked hairdos, intrigued me. But it seemed just a little too cool for me, the idea of going there to get my hair cut intimidated me.

Cut to (no pun intended!) a year later, I was in desperate need of a haircut as I'd fried my hair real bad. Encouraged by my months' of research and pawning over the Parlour website, I finally decided to bite the bullet and make an appointment with Brionie, who has received rave reviews on yelp.

I walked into the salon, and was surprised, because it's completely white, and laid out very simply. There are no fancy-pantsy, obnoxious decorations placed out in order to give off the notion that the salon is more hip or fancy than it actually is. And that's because, this salon doesn't need to make up for shitty haircuts or bad hair-dye jobs with pretty trinkets or walls and walls of fancy hair products: the stylists at Parlour are really just that good and don't need to compensate for a lack of anything with a salon that is aesthetically fancy. The salon's basic and clean appearance helped me to feel at ease, I didn't feel nearly as intimidated as I had before. 

Atfer having my hair washed upon arrival, Brionie came to introduce herself to me. Brionie is super kind and cool. She listened to me patiently as I anxiously apologized about the state of my hair and she laughed in understanding. She then proceeded to take my hair and shape it, thin it out, and cut it so drastically without diminishing the length, that it was a miracle. Stylists are always really hesitant to thin out my hair, but I have ridiculously thick hair that needs to be thinned; Brionie has recognized that and always thins it out appropriately so that it not only looks good, it feels amazing.

The next time I went to see Brionie, I said,  ""Just cut it off. I'm sick of it. I want a cute, fun, short cut. I want it kind of Mia Farrow."" I came out with the best hair cut I've ever had. She listened to me and took into account my face shape, my hair type and generally what I was asking for.

I am completely comfortable with going to Parlour now. Getting my hair cut is now an enjoyable experience again that I look forward to. Best of all, Brionie never judges me for having dead, fried hair, whereas other stylists have scoffed or scolded. She actually used a phrase that I use all the time now, especially when talking about her. She said, ""If you don't have long, gorgeous hair, you're gonna fry the shit out of it."" And that's true. I fry the shit out of my hair time and again. And when I need it coiffed and perfected, I just hop along to Brionie at Parlour and she fixes me right up.",2

The big bowls are pretty massive while the smaller bowls I'd say are still very decent sized too.  The Pho itself is a nice ratio of lots of broth with just enough noodles/meats/etc. - the perfect pick me up on a rainy day here in Phoenix.

This restaurant itself is in an old converted house (like many of the other restaurants in this area) so it's not the biggest place but the wait's usually not too bad if there is one. Parking lot is tiny - you've been warned.",2

The staff was really nice! They were patient with questions and even rewrapped subs when we didn't finish. The man himself Ike was there and he was so friendly! Even though busy, he chatted with us for a bit, telling us his favorites.

Drawn to the uniqueness, I got the Bear Hug. It was so yummy! Just the right amount of spice and creaminess. I would definitely recommend it, but with so many options, you can't go wrong!

7698,3,1548374400000,"The hubby and I stayed at the Trump on our mini-honeymoon for 3 nights in October 2009, and we absolutely LOVED it.  I loved it so much I want to BUY one of the units.  (Didn't I hear one of the towers is comprised of units for sale?!)

Trying to save cash, we opted for a city view studio. $120/night with a $50 spa credit.  The spa credit was supposed to be for one night only, but I flirted with the guy at the desk and he credited us twice!!  (It's cool, the hub's OK with it... he's a cheapskate.  Anything to save a couple $$.)  Oh, AND we got complimentary late check-out til 4pm.

The bed, amazing.  Not too soft, not too firm.  But that's objective.

The bathroom: INCREDIBLE.  Marble, floor to ceiling.  14"" TV screen seamlessly embedded in the GIANT mirror.  Huge spa tub with 3 jet settings. (Which somehow, when you fill it, turns the water blue-ish...nice touch.)  There are separate toilet & shower 'stalls' with floor-to-ceiling glass doors, too. LOVE THIS BATHROOM.  Did I mention it's just a smidge larger than MY BEDROOM at home?!?!

Customer service in the lobby was mediocre, except for my exceptional desk service ;)   Valet and bell service was friendly.  Pool service was GREAT.  Those pool girls work hard taking orders, mingling with the grey-chest-haired, uber fried (I mean, tanned) creepers, and serving up all the refreshing drinks and yummy food... all in bikini tops and Juicy pants!  

Speaking of the pool, it's a bummer that it's so small.  And just watch out for the reflective glare of the gold windows... it's like a second sun!!

About the location... it's directly across from the Wynn, and for 26-year old normal, healthy young adults, the walk from the front door to the Strip was only 3 minutes.  During the daytime, you could even take a shortcut through Nordstrom and cut another minute off (or, if you're like me, add 30 minutes to the walk by shopping......)

7720,2,1547683200000,"I not only make it a point to visit the spa at the hotels I stay at in Vegas but I also love to pamper myself with massages and spa visits here at home so I am seasoned a spa goer. I also know a good massage when I get one and I did not get one here. I spent $150 on a 80 minute Swedish massage and they added a $30 service charge to it which is unbelievable considering I feel like that was not earned. I am all for paying a service charge because the spas in Vegas charge them and I typically tip on top of that but this time I did not. That service charge was more than enough! Ok time to break this down for you. 

Front desk (check in):
Ok this place was off to a bad start because of the experience with checking in. I had an appointment and I arrived an hour beforehand because I planned on enjoying the spa a little before my massage. I arrive and the lady behind the desk is already helping someone. Well what was going on here is he was looking for his wife who I guess was in the spa area. I am standing there waiting and she is dealing with this guy and apparently someone else had already gone to the back to look for his wife. So if that's the case why couldn't he step aside and allow me to be checked in. He was already being helped and this was taking a while so I found it a little annoying. Then she finally acknowledges me and has him step aside so I can be checked in. She gives me a form to fill out and then walks off. I fill out the form and I am left standing there. Another girl comes out and tells the man his wife had already cause she was not back there. She then asks me if I need help and I gave her the form and she checked me in. That took way too long to get started. 

The Spa:
So disappointing! The Luxor has a badass theme to work with and they could have made you feel like Cleopatra or something by having a kick ass spa. Caesar's Palace spa has the Roman Baths so I had thought they might do something like that. The customer service in that area was not that great either. I walked in and I was not greeted.  I was given a locker and a key. I had sandals on already so they did not offer me any. No matter I guess. I was not given a tour or anything so I guess it is good the place is small. The only thing she showed me is where the lockers were. The spa has nothing. Two very small tubs, a sauna, and a steamroom. Nothing else. No cold plunge and the water temps in both spas were too hot. No warm relaxing water spa like the other ones I have been to. Steamroom and Sauna were unimpressive. The only thing this place has going for it is the relaxation area and the juice and fruit they offer. The chairs there were very comfy and they had TV to keep you entertained. I spent most of my time there. 

The Massage:
Another disappointment. I went in for an 80 minute Swedish massage. I ended up getting an 80 minute deep tissue on steroids. It hurt!!! Swedish massages are light to medium pressure and are not meant to hurt. I have had alot of those in my lifetime. The masseuse's name was Kristin and she was rude. No other way to say it. She explained what a Swedish massage was and her words were it is a light to medium pressure full body massage. She also said if she was going too hard or too soft to let her know. Well while she was murdering my neck, back and arms I let her know it was too hard and she got a huge attitude with me about it which shocked me. When I said it was too hard she sighed hella loud and said ""ok uh huh."" After that it was extremely uncomfortable because I think I seriously made her mad. You could cut the tension with a knife. What made it worse is when she was doing my legs she started to hurt me again to the point to where I was wincing so I reluctantly said something again and same reaction. I was so uncomfortable after that. I'm sorry but if I am paying $180 for a massage then I think you should make me comfortable and use the pressure I like without complaint. She was so unprofessional. The one thing she did do well and it felt great was she massaged my face and scalp. The face massage made me melt. It felt amazing and the scalp massage was great too. The rest of it sucked and hurt like hell. I have had deep tissue massages that did not hurt nearly as bad. She made me so uncomfortable because of her reaction that I spent the entire time tense. Let's just say this is why I did not tip on top of the service charge. It was not deserved. Once we were done and I got dressed she walked me back and did not even say goodbye to me or have a nice day or thank you or anything. I only mention that because at other spas they were more polite. 

Check out:
I just wanted out. I got dressed turned in my key and went to the front and paid and left. Check out was quick thank goodness. 

Bottom line I would not come here again even if I got comped. There are WAY too many spas in Vegas where I can spend the same amount of money and have a much better experience and enjoy much better facilities. This place is j",2

7726,2,1548633600000,"Last year, I walked in here to see if anyone could get me in for a Gelish manicure, and luckily, Shannon was available right away. She really took her time to make sure they turned out perfectly, and they lasted for a month without any chips at all! I knew after that visit that I wouldn't be going anywhere else to get my nails done ever again.  I continued to see Shannon every few weeks for gel manicures and I left very impressed every time. The one time that I asked for nail art, she did it exactly how I wanted and it was absolutely perfect. Recently, I decided to get longer nails and wanted to try Shannon's hard gel technique. This is really like nothing else, and I think it is way better than acrylics. It is stronger and shinier and bonds to your entire nail, so they will never pop off no matter what. The gel is also thinner than acrylics so when it grows out, you don't have a huge bump. I've been wearing them for 6 weeks now, and they have never broken or chipped at all, they are seriously so strong! Shannon has a very good eye for shaping them perfectly, and is a total perfectionist. I wanted to try the new trend of pointy ""stiletto"" nails last time, and they came out better than I could have imagined. She custom blends the polish color of your choice into the gel, so the color will never chip, but since it's the top layer only, you can change the color every time you get them filled. And since she makes the colors custom, she can literally do ANY color you want. 
Of course, the incredible quality of the services includes an extreme respect for cleanliness and sanitation. They make a big deal of having all their clean implements stored separately, used once, and then put away to be sanitized again. Shannon even sanitizes her hands right in front of me every time. Every product is labeled, and everything is a top of the line salon brand. There are no mystery lotions or oils in unmarked bottles here.
To top all this off, Exclusive's prices are extremely fair. You are personally pampered and receive a VERY high quality service every time. You are never rushed through to get to the next waiting client and they never talk on the phone or to each other while ignoring you. I have found their prices to only be a couple dollars more than what you would pay at a typical nail salon in a strip mall. They do take walk ins, but because they do like to take their time with every client, I would recommend that you should probably call ahead and make an appointment just to make sure you get in. I have even called just one day before and got in the next morning. 
After experiencing the serious quality and spa-like experience at Exclusive Nails, I will never go anywhere else!",2

This place relaxes me the moment I walk through the door. The faint scent of coffee, the music piping in through the speakers and the rustle of pages turning put me into a completely Zen mood no matter how I was feeling before I entered the store.

Another reason why this is my favorite location is because of their huge windows that look over Kierland Commons. During the summer there are dancing fountains in the center and little kids run through them and during the winter I get the closest to a white Christmas feeling that one can get in a place where it doesn't snow. 

Many winter days I would grab a seat on the second floor overlooking the huge Christmas tree in Kierland Commons, with a caramel apple cider from the Starbucks inside the store. The jolly Christmas music coming through the speakers is the cherry on top of the Sunday.

From a service point of view, this is an amazing group to work with. Very responsive to inquiries and emails. Contracting with them is easy, and pricing is fair and transparent.

My hair and makeup trial was the day before my actual wedding. Melissa came to my room at the Mirage for both the trial and day-of - super convenient. She was on-time and had contacted me several days prior, so I had her number.

I was a bit nervous because I normally don't wear a lot of make up and didn't want to end up looking over done. I was going for a retro-vintage look and had several sample photos of hair and make up. Melissa did an amazing job - I was so happy with the way it turned out. She really cared about making me completely happy and comfortable with the look. 

I had two colorful and fairly large tattoos I wanted covered for my wedding. When Melissa was done, the coverage was flawless. It really was incredible.

The make up lasted well into the night and the curls in my hair held up even after hours of dancing in a night club. I would confidently recommend Amelia C & Co to any Las Vegas bride.",2
7776,1,1547078400000,"Desperately craving pizza, but not of the Pizza Pizza variety, I headed to Pizza Rustica for the first time on the recommendation of a friend who had walked by it many times, never been, but ensured me it always smelt ""very, very good"".

We arrived at about 7:30 on a Friday night, and I was surprised at how very small this place is. There are about 10 - 15 tables and a bar area, and unfortunately we got there just as the last table was snapped up. Luckily there were 2 spots left at the bar, and we were able to get a drink while we waited. A nice surprise occured when our would-be waitress approached us and asked if we'd like to order before we got our table, as the food would arrive as soon as we were seated. Nice one. My stomach at this point was practically jumping out of my throat, so speed was key.

Once seated (about a 20 minute wait at the bar), our food arrived approximately 5 minutes later. I ordered the Tre Carne pizza, with a ton o' meat and banana peppers, onions and tomatoes. The ground beef was fantastic, really flavourful. The pizza itself had a nice thin crust and a thin but balanced layer of sauce and cheese. I personally am not a fan of thick crust or too much sauce - less is more, so this suit me perfectly.

All in all my pizza craving was asauged, and the leftovers (and unless you are ready to eat a small horse, there will be leftovers) tasted even better warmed and with a little hot sauce the next day. The place itself is a little small, so if there are no bar seats I'd move along, as the wait isn't worth it if you're standing around for 20 minutes.",2

7792,1,1546819200000,"ATHLETE'S FOOT - Recently moved to Aurora & was looking for a regular nail place.  Found this place on google, called and made an appointment.  Went in with my husband for pedicures.  They were nice enough.  The lady doing my husband's pedicure did not understand ONE word spoken to her and was super slow.  By the time my lady was done half of my pedicure, the other lady was just on his 3rd or 4th nail.  Not a bid deal, since I figured there will be enough time by the time I'm done. She started shaping my husbands nails, he kept saying no can you please just keep my nail the way it is, I don't want it shaped, but she kept looking at him and cutting it shorter and shorter.  He was so frustrated that the owner noticed, came over & took over to try to fix his nail, but it was too late and they were cut really short (some of his nails grew into his skin after cause they were so short) Up to this point I wouldn't have written a review, cause the owner was trying to be super nice to make up for the screw up and was chatting with us.  I'm not too picky so I wasn't planning on writing anything to complain.  Whatever it was done and done & we figure we won't be going back there again since it's not worth it.  But then came the Athlete's foot.  I've been getting pedicures for the last 10-15 years and never have I caught anything from a pedicure.  I am sooooo angry.  It took so long for it to go away (after buying over the counter stuff, and then going to a doctor).  I'm sure it was from this place because I didn't do anything else (like swimming, or going to gym) that would cause it.  My husband didn't get it, so I guess it's a 50/50 gamble.  I would NEVER EVER step foot in this place again.  Do yourself a favor and don't take the risk.",2

We made reservations months in advance, and somehow we were placed in the back corner of a tiny room, when we had requested main dinning room. 

Service was so sub-par. Drinks were extremely slow to come out (thinking both empty water and wine glasses for quite some time). I physically had to walk to the front hostess area to ask where our server was for drinks before the food came out. 

Three people ordered the quiche, and it was absolutely uneatable. Two sent it back, and it was apparent the server was annoyed by it. We ordered some of the potatoes, and fries came out instead. Steak and eggs were decent and the croquet madame was good but nothing to write home about. 

We never saw a manager until the very end when he took off a round of mimosas, even after having to go find someone to help us and sending back not one but TWO dishes.

7831,3,1548892800000,"Worst hotel experience ever.

Air conditioner/heater under window was loud and couldn't get comfortable temperature.

Two lamps in room.  One had no switch on lamp, cord or wall to turn it off.  Base to screw bulb into was loose and couldn't remove bulb or stop it from flickering.  Due to risk of electrocution if I continued trying to unscrew bulb, unplugged the lamp from outlet behind desk in a corner.  Insufficient electric outlets were all hard to reach, in use by a lamp, clock, hairdryer, etc. and hidden behind furniture at floor molding level.  

TV didn't work-- was uncontrollable.  Mostly just a black screen and silence.  Got Bloomberg news a couple of times but any effort to change channels or find TV guide brought black screen back.  No instructions or channel line-up list in room but I don't think they would've helped.

Bathroom was tiny...barely space to close door.  Vanity sink belched back a foul smell when ran water in it.  No place to hang thin towels for reuse.  No control over shower water pressure, hair-trigger temperature changes and drain couldn't keep up.  After five minutes showering, water was ankle-deep.

Queen beds were lumpy.  Each had two small, flat feather pillows.

Could continue but would rather put the whole experience behind me.  Now that I've written this review, my good deed is done.

It was my mistake not to check current reviews before husband made reservations.  He enjoyed the place alone during a motorcycle event in 2004-5.

Very inexpensive, well done pedis and manis and massages.

Had they given me a few good taro balls, then I could justify and say ""I've tried this place, it's decent but it's overpriced, I would never go back"". However, if your restaurant specializes in taro balls, yet, you fail in that department, then your restaurant does not deserve to stay open.

This was also quite good. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse, which is accented by a topping of cinnamon-coated maple bacon (amazing) and mint.

The rest of the buffet is just OK, the hot wings were pretty good and the beef selection (I think it was prime rib) was a tasty break from the crab. On the other hand, the desserts are great! The desserts are awesome with lost of little one potion custard-type and ultra rich selections. The restaurant is nicely decorated with dim lighting and lots of light wood finishes.

7917,3,1547769600000,I really like the food.  Come once a week for wings. However...their waitresses are just rude.  Never a smile.  I mean never.  They act pissed off all the time.  Hello management....kick some wait staff butt and treat your customers like they are appreciated.  For two years we've come here and they pretend they've never seen us before.  I'm talking at 630 for food....not midnight when they are tired.  WORST WAIT STAFF IN CLT.  PERIOD.,2

Bottom line is that there's nothing new here that you won't find at any other buffet in town, and although it's a self-perpetuating problem, the lack of customers meant that the food was mostly sitting out rather than being refreshed and looked old and was not terribly warm.

I got a piece of fish once that you could drive a nail with. The Rubens are always stringy and it's impossible to take a bite out of the sandwich without dragging all the meat out in one big glob.

My onlyyy two complaints: the women's bathroom could do with a little TLC (one of the stall doors doesn't lock and it's a little cold, dark, and dingy in there overall) and when there's a band playing, it's reeeally loud since the acoustics are less-than-ideal.

7985,3,1547078400000,"We have a beautiful air BNB here at Palms Place with balconies, tub and beautiful decor. That's the only reason I'm giving this review 2 stars. From the moment I got here we've been having issues with anything customer service related. Forget room service and forget asking them for anything. They will say yes and then proceed to just not show up. We literally waited 2 hours for 2 water bottles. Impossible to reach bell boys, room service and other customer service which is weird because it's off peak being Monday-Tuesday. This hotel is gorgeous and the air BNB price was amazing but I am so disappointed with how we've been treated during our stay. 

UPDATE: due to the beautiful view and price of Palms Place, we decided to give it one more go. Horrible choice. Unfortunately we came through the night of the Las Vegas shooting. The entrance to the hotel was closed off. When we tried to pull up we were swarmed with security and were told to park away from the hotel (valet was closed due to the shooting) for some reason they thought it was okay to send us off to a main parking lot when this shooter was at large with absolutely no warning. Security did not say anything about a shooting at all, they gave us no reason for valet being closed. My husband and I found out from our loved ones texting and calling us asking if we were alright. After hurrying back to the hotel nervous as hell, we found the doors locked. After 5 minutes of being left outside we were finally let in. This is absolutely horrible protocol. No security escort to or from that public lot, no explanation or warning, no security at the door to let people in in case of an accident... I know these events aren't planned but the way they handled it was horrible. Not to mention our phone was broken when we got to our room, so we had to walk right back down to get baggage.

Bartender brought us water but did not take a drink order. When we finally got her attention we asked about the food since it is a complicated menu. They seem to be excited about their pizza but have their own lexicon and she did a poor job of explaining, but in her defense there is a lot to explain and it was busy. Manager standing around watching instead of helping. Back to reading menu. Decided to just get the pizza special. 
Beer came. Very short pour.  When I questioned I was told it was a higher alcohol beer so, like many places, it was an eight ounce poor in a snifter. Ok. But I poured out water glass and poured in beer and at best it was a six ounce poor. At best. Additionally, they are charging $8  for that small pour for a mid-range local craft beer. 
Then we were told the kitchen was backed up and the wait would be at least 30 minutes. Time to leave. 
Bartender talked to the manager and came back and offered some cheese curds but we were already heading out. Paid for the drinks snd left. 
Bartender at least tried, earning the two stars and maybe a trip back.

8068,1,1547337600000,"We chose to dine at Beauty & Essex after a last minute change of heart. We decided to go with a lighter menu, instead of the Steak and Chops place we had originally picked.

From the second I walked into the Pawn Shop in the afternoon to check if they had any availability that night, I could tell this establishment understood hospitality. I was treated like a welcomed guest rather than a last minute bother. 

When we showed up early for our reservation, we were greeted like regulars even though it was our first visit. We stopped at the bar and ordered two glasses of Cava from Casey, our pleasant, friendly, informative bartender.

Before long, our table was ready and we were escorted to our table in the beautiful, if a little dimly lit dining room. The menu here is mainly small plate, meant for sharing type of set up. There are a few larger options listed under the Prime Meats section, but since we had steak the night before, we decided to stick with the smaller options.

Dish #1
Roasted Bone Marrow with Rioja Braised Shallot Marmalade and Grilled Bread.

Bone Marrow is everywhere these days, but we love it and order it just about every time we see it. This was one of our favorite versions ever. The combination of the Rich, Meaty Marrow, Sweet Shallots, Crunchy, Perfectly Grilled Bread was one of the best bites I've had in a long time.

Dish #2
Grilled Cheese and Smoked Bacon Dumplings on Tomato Soup.

These one bite wonders were the highlight of the night. They brought back childhood memories of dipping my grilled Velveeta sandwich into my Campbell's Tomato Soup, only a thousand times better!

Dish #3
""Fish and Chips"" Tacos, Beer Battered Sea Bass, Chile-Lime Slaw, Crispy Matchstick Potatoes.

This was our least favorite dish of the night. It was still very good, but more one note than our other selections.

Dish #4
Basil Pesto Ravioli with Rock Shrimp and Tomato Fondue.

Excellent little pillows of pasta filled with a flavorful Pesto. They would've been fine on their own, but the sauce and perfectly cooked, juicy Shrimp took it to another level.

We were filling up so we decided against Dessert, but there were several items that looked very interesting that we will definitely save room for next time. Beauty and Essex is easily wheelchair accessible and service is wonderful. With so many dining options in Vegas, we only have two restaurants on our must visit list (N9NE and Julian Serrano Tapas). Beauty and Essex is a strong contender to become the third member!",2

8092,3,1548720000000,I was not impressed.  I have to wonder how their food was deemed to be one of the best burgers in Toronto.  The bun was fresh but way too much bread for a burger. I didn't find the list of toppings to stray too far from any other burger place.  I had the hand made onion rings.  Awful with way too much batter on the onions.  In a few rings the batter was three times the thickness of the onion.  The chocolate milkshake was decent but not epic like Mr. Greenjeans (a la Eaton's Center).

8116,3,1546646400000,"I came for dinner before a concert at the Grand Garden.  I was seated promptly in the back room rather than take a table at the bar.  The whole place including this room are very dark with mirrors most notably running the length of the ceiling.

My server brought a menu and a water glass was filled.  The server stopped by again and asked about drinks and I ordered my usual iced tea which was soon brought.  My dinner consisted of three tapas plates--octopus ceviche with grapefruit and pickled jalapeño, shrimp risotto with a tomato fondue and arugula, and ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib and pea purée.  For dessert, I got the chocolate makeout--a warm chocolate fondant with salted caramel cream, peanut brittle, and caramel sauce.

The octopus ceviche was very good.  The dish had a good citrus flavor from the grapefruit and the pickled jalapeños added a good contrast.  Served with the dish was a small amount of corn chips which I ate along with the octopus.

The shrimp risotto was OK.  There was nothing special about the dish.  The shrimp were large but the dish as a whole lacked any wow factor to make the whole standout.   The shrimp were also a bit chewy.

Last was the ricotta gnocchi with braised short rib and pea purée.  I really liked this dish. The short rib was very tasty as opposed to the bland ricotta gnocchi and there was no discernible taste of the pea purée at all.  Still, I liked the flavor of the short rib and the softness of the gnocchi made a good fit.

Dessert was the chocolate makeout--almost a chocolate lava cake but mercifully not another rendition of this ubiquitous dessert.  The chocolate fondant was rich and I could have piped the salted caramel cream directly into my mouth.  The peanut brittle and small amount of caramel sauce added texture and flavor to the dessert.

Service was varied.  The iced tea was brought with no sugar or other sweeteners.  When the server came by one time, he stopped and then asked if I  had wanted any sugar.  I asked for some artificial sweetener which he never brought.  After he went by a few times, I stopped a busser and asked him and I had a container of sweeteners in no time at all.

When it came time for dessert, a different server stopped by and asked me if I wanted dessert.  I ordered from her.  After dinner, the original server brought my check and took payment.

The server didn't ask if I needed anything explained from the menu nor did he mention more than one off menu special.  The other server mention a couple of them to the tab;e next to me and asked them if they had been to the restaurant before.  She then went on to describe some of the dishes and told the people if there were any other questions to ask her.  I think maybe she should have been with me the whole time.  The bus persons were very efficient and removed finished plates in a timely manner.

Crush is OK.  Your paying Strip prices for some average food.",2

I have posted the picture. Replacement pizza arrived 2 hours after my initial order with crust just as bas and ice cold. Thank, never will we order here again.",2

8196,1,1547510400000,"If I could give El Hefe 3.5 stars I would. This bar seems to be one of those places where you can expect a certain type of crowd. It's like a middle ground between The Lodge and Dos Gringos. 

On a regular Friday or Saturday night El Hefe is a good place to get a quick drink or to just hang out. There always seems to be somewhere you can sit down or hang out at this place, unlike some other bars. 

I also went here on NYE and it was very fun. Paid a cover charge and then drinks were a penny all night. 

The vibe of the bar is half undergrad Spring Break, half an episode of Miami Ink. However, the service is good and the drinks are strong. Don't let the D-bag outer layer deter you for giving El Hefe a shot. I have yet to try the food, but I am doubtful with all of the options in Old Town I would ever choose to come to El Hefe for their food.",2

Taste is fine - just what you'd expect and just as good as the ""parent location"". They also offer beef brisket, which is different, and actually, pretty good (though there isn't a lot of it if you get it in a double combo with something else). No wide noodles here though, which is too bad!

8224,1,1547510400000,"Have visited Port City on a number of occasions.  Each being hit or miss.  Here is a multi-million dollar property, with the potential to be a outstanding lake side restaurant.  Each visit has been tainted by incredibly poor attention to detail, either by the Wait staff or the food itself.  The price structure is one you may expect to pay while enjoying the view on the lake, but honestly the food never reaches those price points in dining.  Each time we have visited we have had to introduce ourselves to the waiter or waiter.  Each time asking to know what the specials are.  Our last visit was at lunch time.  We ordered the Baked brie to start.  It was serve uncooked on a small platter with a small(maybe 6 Pepperidge Farm Crackers).  On the plate the fruit compote was actually some type of fruit jam.  As we scrapped the hardened Brie from the dried crust we asked for some more crackers or maybe a smidge of warm bread-our waitress sorry ""got no mor"" and walked away.  Next to the Club sandwiches we asked them to be serve with their special potato salad side. Special indeed, the potatoes were not completely cooked and the only seasoning to the flavor was the watery mayonnaise they happened to brushed over the rock hard potatoes.  The Club consisted of cheap deli meat, nothing fresh or even high end attempts were made at the meat.  The sandwich had been thoroughly and completely dipped in some type of oil and fried on the grill. So much so the we had to ask for additional napkins to keep up with the removal of the oil from our hands. After a few small greasy bites we asked for our check. Our Waitress whom we had flagged down by standing up, came up and said ""didn't like it much"" we said no and she took or credit card for payment.  By the way never had a refill on any beverages.  We figured her time was better well spent talking with the guys working near the bar outside, since this appear to be where she spent most of her time.  I wish them well at Port City. Just not at my expense.",2
8229,2,1546560000000,"I absolutely love this place. I think it's ideal for meat lovers. 
We were here Friday night when they have bigger selection of steaks, as well as chicken and fish. Also I love corn bread and cheese bans. 
I would recommend to come there a bit earlier like at 5-5:30 pm because there are less people and you will get food circulate faster around you and by the time you are done the music and show starts at 7 pm and you can enjoy it without worrying about getting fed. The salad bar has good selection of salads and cheeses, again I don't eat much there as I want to have enough space for steaks, they are excellent. 
The service is great as well, they do make sure you are fed well and tried all you wanted!",2

8240,3,1547078400000,"Upon looking for places to eat breakfast, this location popped up and we were not disappointed in finding this gem outside the strip of Vegas!
Upon arriving, I was somewhat skeptical because of how the place looked at its exterior. Just a simple sign, with a large bronze door at the entrance. It's magical when you open that door!
The interior is beautiful! The decor is amazing! With a mixture of everything inside, what looks like a green house! Definitely chill place with Jazz music playing in the background. My husband and I dined during the morning, hence there was not a large selection of pastries available, such as their infamous ones shown on their pictures. These pastries aren't available until after 3 pm, but we still ate some of their croissants. My husband had their smoked salmon on top of bread, and it was heavenly. Cooked to perfection!
We then proceeded to get their red velvet Cinnabon roll! DELICIOUS! I've never had a red velvet Cinnabon roll in my life!

8242,3,1548892800000,"Been awhile since I've written a review and since that last review, have to say this is now one of my favorite ""locals"" places in town and it's time to give them some  well deserved love on Yelp. Loved the service the first time I walked in and keep going back on my home from the office.

Rachel & Rachel, Heather, Muoy, Austin and Aaron are all great bartenders and Gia is a great server...  Super nice and genuinely great people that will put a big smile on your face with their upbeat personalities. 

There are plenty of very cool regulars that go here consistently which should tell you a lot right there about the place. There is a reason why this place was named Best Locals bar by Seven Magazine last year.

This is truly a locals bar owned by a local and it's not uncommon to see Jason (the owner) there and is a super nice guy. As their motto goes, ""We take care of our players like Old Vegas used to"". For some of us that have been in Vegas since the 1990's... we certainly know what this means before everything got so corporate and neighborhood bars started nickel and diming everybody.

I'm not a big gambler and rarely play but they certainly take care of me and it's NOT one of those places that if you stick $20 bucks in, hit something and play it all back, you'll only get comped one drink. (Places like that annoy me.)

Happy Hour is 3 to 7 with $2 Domestic Draft pints and $5 Maker Marks. (Not entirely sure what other drink prices are.) Appetizers are $5 and WELL worth $5. $2 Coors Light Pints during Football games and it's a GREAT place to watch Games with big TV's right at the bar or a couple of huge ones in the back dining area. (If you love The Bears -- this is certainly a great place to go for Bears games.)

Even when it's not Happy Hour, I highly suggest the Street Tacos and as others have mentioned, the Nachos are divine.

$ for $, one of the best places in town that I've been to and I've been to a lot of places. Your mileage might vary but I can guarantee you if you are cool to the staff, you will certainly be taken care of.",2

8263,1,1546992000000,"The Flamingo isn't the most blinging hotel in Vegas. No, the Bellagio or MGM Grand or a couple others might eclipse the aging Flamingo but its a great place to stay. There was a special going on Expedia that we found and for two round trip tickets from Baltimore to Vegas and 5 days at the Flamingo in the Go Rooms was $660. A pretty damned good deal.

We showed up to the hotel and had a little time to kill before our rooms were available. I'm sure it was just a way to get you to gamble a little bit and get a lay of the land for the casino. We checked our luggage and had it brought up to our rooms after they were ready. The Go Rooms are roomy enough, clean, and we had a great view of the strip. Our rooms were cleaned in the morning and always had a nice made bed. Room service said they were backed up but food was brought only after about 20 minutes. Decent food...good when you're back from the casinos or a show nice and drunk.

The crowning point of the hotel isn't the casino though. Or the rooms, the places to eat but its the location and the pool. The hotel sits right on the strip and in the middle of everything. It has a monorail access point at the bottom of the hotel which makes transportation easy.

The pool though was my favorite. A large pool with 4 waterfalls was where I spent a good time sleeping off hangovers and resting up for the crazy nights to come. There are tons of room to sit, but with so many people coming and going, space is at a premium. The pool is clean and cool, a great place to beat the heat. The hotel does offer a topless pool but I can't speak on that. I do believe its free for women and $10 for male guests except Friday and Saturday when it is $20. Cabanas are available around the pool but you can't get sun in a covered Cabana!! There are gorgeous waitresses in tiny pink bikinis that will take your drink orders and sometimes Chippendales guys come around and hand tickets out to the ladies.

A great bang for your buck. Nothing glitzy or high end but its clean, convenient, and close to anything you need. A recommendation for people on a budget but still want the strip experience.",2
8267,3,1547424000000,"This was my 2nd visit, this time was placed order to go, catfish. 15 min later and ready for pick up.  Order was hot and presentation was good.  My order was very tasty. The bread given with the dinner, could have been more crispy, a little soggy.",1
8273,2,1546646400000,"UPDATE:  I revisited the place today because I thought I'd give them a second chance, after all they are just opening.

Their problem is that they haven't figured out how to do a wood-fired, thin-crust pizza.  While the toppings are very good, their pizza is greatly diminished because their crust isn't right.  Great wood-fired crust should be a bit crisp on the bottom--but NOT burnt.  Theirs is soggy.  I first went in during the evening.  This time I went in at lunch time.  There was a manager there this time who came by and asked how things were. I told her that the pizza wasn't great because the crust was soggy and tough.  She indicated that they weren't baking it long enough and would work with the cooks.  

IMHO, the difference between just average pizza and great pizza is in the crust.  It's easy to use fresh ingredients, not so easy to make a great crust.  This is where they are falling down.  Hopefully time will tell if they get this one right, but for the cost ($15+) for a 6-slize pizza and a drink with a sub-par crust is too much to pay.

=====================================================================
It is obvious that the owners put a lot of money and effort into this place.  It is very nice inside.  The seating is comfortable and well decorated. 

However, decor alone does not a restaurant make.  When I first walked in I sensed a problem because the place smelled like burned popcorn.  I dismissed that and I ordered a pepperoni, kalamata and mushroom pizza.  Pretty standard.  Their first attempt came out with the crust totally cremated.  It was scorched on the top and incinerated on the bottom, yet the center was still raw.  I took it back and asked for a re-do.  The second attempt came out a little better, but the crust was just doughy, floppy as a dish rag and basically gross.   The toppings slid off into a pile of mush on my plate.  

I think the basic problem is that the place is being staffed by a bunch of young kids.  They have no idea what they are doing, and there is no management there to help.  They have a lot of money tied up in it,  and it is a shame that there is no one there to watch the shop.",2

Though the restaurant is located in an inconspicuous section of the south hills, I was surprised how spacious and recently renovated the interior of Katana is.

We made reservations here and were promptly seated when we arrived. We started with Crab Rangoons, which I really enjoyed. Two of us ordered hibachi while the other two of us ordered Sweet & Sour Chicken. We were told that the Sweet & Sour Chicken was not made in house, but I thought it was tasty. Our portions were large, and it was definitely the bestSweet & Sour that I've eaten in some time. 

We watched a hibachi show that a young chef put on for the large group of 12 or so sitting next to us. He joked around with the children, gave everyone shots of sake, tossed around his utensils, and set an impressive fire. Our hibachi chef was just for the four of us and was not quite as skilled. He spent less time entertaining and made a few mistakes when tossing around his utensils. I did get some pretty great pictures of the fire he set though.

8401,3,1548288000000,"Staying in Phoenix for the night before an early flight out tomorrow, so decided to check these guys out.  I'm a Kansas City native, so know something about BBQ.

Most people don't realize that BBQ is only half about the food.  The other half is about the family.  BBQ was born in places where money and resources were tight, but the family was tighter.  When you walk into MJ's, you feel like family and are treated as such.  They might be from Tennessee and Michigan, but I may as well have known them my entire life.  When it comes to that aspect of BBQ, they have it nailed, no question.  Even if they were serving cold cut sandwiches, I'd come back just for the hospitality.

The food was good as well.  I got the two meat platter with brisket, pulled pork, coleslaw, green beans, and added a hot link.  The brisket was cooked properly and had a solid crust.  The fat was rendered just right and left the meat excellent.  The pulled pork was sort of hit or miss, but also had a solid crust.  Part of the pork was a bit dry, but the other part was juicy and fantastic.  Could have just been because it was late in the evening and it was a 20 minute drive back to the hotel for me.  The sausage was the typical andouille sausage found in lots of BBQ places.  The coleslaw was extra saucy, which I like, and delicious (try adding BBQ sauce to coleslaw sometime!).  The green beans were sort of rough - seemed like canned green beans just warmed up.  Fresh green beans with bacon, onions, and some seasoning would have been a welcome replacement.  The BBQ sauce was vinegary, Memphis style (no surprise there), verging on Carolina style.  Bigger portions than I expected.  Overall, nothing to complain about with the food.

The worst part about MJ's is the location.  I'm not a Phoenix local, but it sure seemed like a tough part of town.  There were a number of folks just walking in the middle of the street, staring at my car as I drove by, etc.  Everything was fine, but there were certainly no warm fuzzies to be had driving to their location.  It's also situated in kind of a weird place and you have to find a particular side road that leads you to their restaurant (although my GPS navigated me without issue).

So, overall, solid food, questionable location, AMAZING people.  If M & J can manage to find a new location, there will be nothing to stop them.",2

We then went to the coffee shop next door (same grounds) and had to die for cupcakes!  Extremely busy because the place is so unique and such good food.

8428,2,1547683200000,"This has been my weekly go to foot spa when I'm not traveling. I've never had to wait whether alone or with my fiancé. Foot massages are a dime a dozen in Chinatown and some (if not most) try to upsell despite the low advertised prices in front of the store. Good Foot Spa thankfully doesn't do that and the price chart clearly reflect the services and length of time you're going to get.

It can be hard to communicate with some of the masseuses but they will bring you a price chart and you can point to the length and service you want. During the massage they will ask if the pressure is too hard/soft etc. For the basic $20 foot massage they will start with your head, face, and shoulders while your feet are soaking. After 15-20 minutes they will rub your feet and legs getting the pressure points. Last but not least they will have you turn over and will work on your back and shoulders.  

Not everything is perfect here. Sometimes it can be loud and I've had masseuses talking to each other in Chinese before (annoying). Overall, the value of the massages I have received have been top notch and there has never been any waiting time. Be sure to tip them accordingly (I give $10-15). It's totally worth it.",2

General tso's - pretty good. It's spicy like I requested. Sauce was all at the bottom, just needed a stir. Chicken was cooked nearly perfect, some a little chewy but better than the normal weird and slimy chicken you get. Sauce is really good.

My Dishes: 
1st time..
·Rice and fried veggies- my first time -  Good, wasn't impressed.

2nd time..
·Fried tempura- sweet potatoes, zucchini, & potatoes- Delicious! The sweet potatoes were decadent, much better than the regular potatoes. 
·Egg noodles with Brown Sauce- not so good, one bite and I was done. 
·Zucchini, broccoli, and onions in a Brown Sauce- incredible!! Loved it!!! Yum! 
· White rice- very good! Nice and Sticky!!

3rd Time..
*Note to self and everyone else*
       ·Sir Fry = Regular Brown Sauce
       ·Brown Sauce = too sweet, similar to teriyaki

Polly came to the rescue and helped explain how to order what I like next time. 

·House Ginger Salad- Excellent!
·Ended up with the Stir fry- broccoli, zucchini, onion- was mediocre this time.  


My friend's Dishes:

1st time..
·Tuna - A massive plate! She said it's a 10!! She compared it to when she had the Increadible Tuna over seas. Love at first taste!

2nd time..
· Salad with ginger dressing- omg good! We both loved it!!
·The protein platter- It was good for what it was. My friend prefers the tuna better!

3rd Time..
·Spicy Tuna- good
·Scallops- good

The ambience hasn't changed, it's an AWESOME hot spot and I'd give it 5 Stars IF after they would have simply demonstrated good management skills by at least talking to me.  2 of our 4 party ordered the same dinner and both had the same issue for which we sincerely attempted to get the GM to know, affording him the opportunity to do something, anything - but instead in spite of him telling me he'd call me back in a day or two ( he wanted to discuss it with his chef), he never did.  A week later I called again and had to leave a message.  Oddly enough someone from the establishment reached out after seeing my pre-review ""PENDING RESOLUTION"" on Yelp and asked for details; I provided them and told her I had already spoken to the GM.  She too said she'd get back to be - I never heard back from her either.  So, in light  of this disappointing resolution, I would say........
GO, have fun, you'll love it.  It's not inexpensive and that's totally fine when it meets the minimum quality expectations.  I believe  they're still in a transition so I'm confident I'll be back - have dined here many times and always been pleased.",2
8498,2,1546473600000,"Let me say this... my total package cost me $4500 for underarms & bikini line. That was 3 years ago. I have pale white skin with dark hair so apparently thats the most receptive skin/hair combo to the laser and this may be the reason I had good results.

Well, as much as I paid, I would have to say that scheduling my laser appointments was such a pain in the ass.... they only let you come in every three months. If you do not schedule it in advance they are ALWAYS too busy to take you and often you have to wait 4 weeks out when your hair is growing back in. Same situation arises if you need to reschedule a booking. ugh.

The laser feels like someone is taking a rubber band and pulling it back as far as they possibly can and snapping it against your skin. (pretty darn painful at times.) I refused any numbing creams and was able to make it through each session. 

At the end of your contract when all of your sessions are complete, you then have to start paying for ""touch ups"" so basically it is NOT permanent!!!! However, my hair has been greatly reduced and I get touch ups about every 4 to 5 months. 

So its the kind of investment that you have to keep investing in...  

Was it worth it? (The ONLY reason I'm giving it 4 stars) 
1. I DO love not  having underarm hair
2. If you have an insecurity.. you gotta' do what you gotta' do to make yourself happy ;)

The staff was very friendly in getting me to try a second bowl. I've been to the restaurant that Mr Fan first went to in Waikiki and the noodles there and also Jumbo and Iyo were both firm and chewy.

This family run business offers traditional Indian foods with a take away/order at the counter set up. While no, it's not your typical ""sit down fancy Indian restaurant, I think it's a refreshing change to have more varieties of ""fast food"" in the valley. They offer a wide selection of vegetarian/vegan and gluten free options. The staff is extremely friendly and gave detailed descriptions of the meals and offered some great suggestions. They have a lovely patio to dine on or you can eat inside. I've never been disappointed with any meal I've had there. The portions are plentiful and I always leave with leftovers. They also offer a lovely selection of sweet and savories you can enjoy after your meal or bring home for later. I would highly recommend checking this place out! Even if you think you don't like Indian food- give it a try. My picky teen even found a few things she really enjoyed.",1

8573,3,1546387200000,"holy moly. i never thought i'd stand in a line for 45 minutes in cleveland to get a gyro of all things. this line was a monster. as was the gyro i got at the end of it.

steve's gyros is located in the westside market among a bunch of other amazing food stands. just waiting in this line brought business to the other stands next to it. we got some popcorn, fresh juice, and purchased and got fresh fish cleaned while waiting! 

most of the wait was because the meat wasn't cooking fast enough for the demand! they had 3 heaters that would spin the meat and cook it. at the right moment the ladies would shave it off and cook it. i really appreciated that the lady would shout out the reasons why things were slow. it just made me a little more patient by knowing that

the pita was a little greasy for me. actually the whole thing was dripping grease out of the foil. but i ate it up anyway! my gyro was so huge and the ladies gave me so much meat i HAD to take some out. there was no way i was going to get a single bite of anything but lamb if i didn't take some out. they loaded it up! the foil could barely hold in all the meat! 

***please note: there is a sign that does say your serving depends on your attitude****
so don't waltz in there feeling entittled to anything. cause you migth get the opposite of what you asked for!

they also have these very strict rules about their business. no cutting in half. no ordering for others. better follow their rules or you'll be leaving empty handed! why? ""because i said so"" as their little sign explains",2

I'm not about to hike to uptown, and Small Bar was a nice low-key option (aka cheap/affordable/easy on the wallet) right there.  Parking is free (lots across the street).

The patio of Small Bar is bigger than the inside.  On a nice night, it's a nice place to hang out, especially great for people watching... and I mean GREAT for people watching.  There was a 2-man show playing live music outside, entertaining enough, but I would be fine without listening to his sometimes-creepy pick up acts.  

Beer special was $2 for Miller Lite and $3 for Stella.  Not too chabby.",2
8588,2,1547164800000,What can I say about NBC...They are pretty much my favorite maker of cakes ever...well at least this location. I first tasted their cakes as a gift from one of my managers year's ago. I was so impresed I purchased my very own cake a few weeks later.  Shortly thereafter I move to CA and was sad to leave NBC until I heard a location opened up in San Diego...I had my husband drive me there while I was having a pregnancy craving only to be disappointed about that franchise...so now I make a point everytime I go to vegas I pick me up a cake from the Sahara location. The cakes are the bomb I have tasted every kind..; My favorite are Red Velvet and Marble and oh yeas in case you have to have they ship them...I had a craving while in Chicago and had them ship too for my family to enjoy....Nothing Bundt Cakes is a must try.,2

She has given me pixie cuts, assymetrical cuts, and not-super-painful growing out my hair trims and they always look fantastic. I am complimented frequently on my hair, and people are always shocked to hear that I go to Great Clips. I have only had Malia cut my hair at this location, but she is friendly, professional, and always does what I ask her to (or when I come in and say ""I don't know, just make it cute,"" she still rocks something nice for me).",3

The bartender who assisted with my pickup order is the only reason this has a two star review. She was very nice and pleasant.  The vegetarian burrito and vegetable enchiladas on the other hand were not. The green sauce came out of a can about 15 seconds prior to being put on the food. The waxy cheese covered mushy corn and I believe flour tortillas.  Vegetarian at this location means I hope you like peppers and onions because that's all your getting.  We are fans of good guacamole and have heard there's was good so we tried it--- threw half of the 2 Oz we were given (for 6.99) away. 95% chunky onion and tomato, and really no flavor.  If the 4 people sitting at a table being the only customers at 6pm on a Thursday night wasn't a clue, the food surely was a sign to avoid Luchita's.

They only carry the pink sweetener.  
When my new wings come out one is the wrong dry rub.  I've been waiting for about 10 minutes now.  
We had to ask three times for napkins. 
My coworker and I ordered carrots and celery.  Had to ask for those 4 times.  When the manager dropped them off he just put them on the table and walked away.

I wanted some pho for lunch. I work out in the land of the lame: Solon, OH so ethnic foods are just a dream. I called my friend and we went for a bowl of pho 8 miles up the road in Woodmere. The service was fantastic. The place was packed at around 1:30 pm and they got us in and out pretty quickly. I still prefer Minh Anh to any pho in the city but this will do in a pinch if you are out for lunch in the eastern suburbs of Cleveland.",2
8614,2,1547683200000,"I have been to Kennedy's at least four times now and have very much become a fan for a few reasons.  First, the food is reliable and enjoyable.  Traditional bar food with several Irish dishes and some vegetarian options.  I've shared the nachos, had the Hawaiian salad and the Black Bean burger.  All nice sized and sufficient.  Not a lot of parking, but off-street is fine.  They are EXTREMELY dog-friendly which is awesome.  They've brought a water bowl and treats both times I've taken mine.  Kennedy's also does a lot of coupons (Groupon, Livingsocial, Half-Off Depot, etc.) and are very friendly about patrons using them.  Once a group tried to use four (though it clearly states one per table), but since there were 8 people they offered to honor two, which I thought was pretty cool.  Dependable spot for sports watching, too.",2
8614,3,1547510400000,"Finally made it to this large, loud, dimly lit Italian resto. The verdict: Not bad, not fantastic.

True, I had super high expectations given all the positive word-of-mouth...also, every time I tried to make a reservation for an upcoming Saturday, they were fully booked. I ended up reserving a table a few weeks in advance, which just added to my expectations of greatness.

Homemade ""naked"" mozzarella - yummy but a little tough to cut through; not as soft/creamy as I expect fresh mozzarella to be. (However, bonus points for the dollop of jam and the generous pile of sea salt.)

Margherita pizza - so thin they give you special scissors to cut it! The pizza (flavours, crust) was just okay, nothing special.

Meatballs with fettuccine - the meatball was quite tasty; pasta was a bit forgettable. (Tip: For dynamite Italian meatballs try Seven Numbers uptown on Eglinton.)

On the plus side, the portions were very generous...my companion and I split the pasta/meatballs and they offered to divide the dish in the kitchen and serve it on separate plates (love that). When it arrived, it looked like two full-sized entrees.

Sangria is excellent.

TIP: Even though the address says Yonge St, the entrance is on Gerrard.",2
8615,1,1547424000000,"All the excellent Yelp reviews helped me decide to give Silverstate Locksmith a try, and I'm so glad I did!  You gotta be careful when trusting locksmith businesses due to the possibility of those scammers out there.  Mike German arrived on time and immediately showed me his sheriff's ID and license which made me feel a lot more comfortable using his services.  He quickly replaced 2 locks for me and was even nice enough not to charge me for rekeying one of my old locks which really needed to be changed out instead.  He also gave me 2 extra key copies free! Mike showed a professional and honest character, and his work is of high quality because I could easily tell how much more secure my new locks are compared to the old ones!  I also appreciate the fact that he offers prompt communication by email and texting as well as by phone. Thanks for making my home feel safer, Silverstate Locksmith!!!

8619,3,1546300800000,"I have been to this location many times to meet our friends for breakfast on the weeknd. More often than not, we have to wait for a table - as it is one of the go to places in Airdrie - me thinks. 
There are several regular servers I have seen there over the past 2 years, and for the most part, they have the service down to a system that works. Occassionally I will go in and have an odd experience - like this past weekend. We were seated and noone came around - I brought it to the attention of a young server - I asked for coffee for the table and mentioned that I had no cup and that noone had taken our order. He just started pouring the coffee, then poured another, at which point I said - "" Can you say something? "" LOL it was an odd and funny moment.  The server later apologized said he zoned out... It wasnt a big deal  He was young and hey we have all just zoned out like that - it was the exception at this place re service not the rule. 
Basically though - the service here is fast and efficient and the food is consistently good.  The coffee is always quite good and the pace of the place always reminds me of a busy diner.  Be prepared to wait on the weekends in the morning for a table, but I think you will always be satisfied with the value for money and the reliable service.",2

Just a great place for a vacation while still being in vegas and virtually on strip for all the ""vegas"" stuff too.

WOuld not be my prime spot for just 1-2 days.  Great for Longer stays though.

Great workout room....Room service wings are LEGIT!

I pass it by all the time but decided to cool down with one of their smoothies this afternoon and it was fantastic. I like how they have their menu in order by flavor and they have interesting and fun concoctions.Wanting something orange like, I got the Carolina Sunrise, which was refreshing and delicious but had to stop slurping it down due to a case of the brain freeze. And they have punch cards which is just straight up awesome. I love that they sell protein powders there including Spiru-tein (my favorite brand due to their funky flavors).

Who needs to go to the king of smoothies when you have a local establishment that makes tastier smoothies that cost less?",2

That's the first time we eat there, so we take a lil time to decide which is the best way we can share with each other the meal. Since my mom only speak Chinese, we were using Chinese to conversation with my mom. After, we done the order. I saw the staff's face was kinda showing us like he didn't want to server us.


While we are enjoying the meal, there's a strange loud man voice yelled at us "" STUPID ASIAN!"" I'm was really fcking angry at that moment.  I'LL NEVER GO TO RAISING CANE's EVER! THE FOOLISHNESS OF THE STAFFS TOTALLY LOST MY APPETITES!",2

8654,2,1546732800000,"We have taken our dog, Sophie, a few times now to the dog park at the Tempe Sports Complex. It is absolutely fabulous once you find it! The Complex is huge, so the first time we went, we parked on the opposite side where the dog park is located since we didn't know better. My only problem is that there are no signs directing you at the Complex where everything is.  Since then we have figured out exactly where the dog park is and the best place to park (hint: turn onto Carver Rd and you can park in the lot right in front of the dog park. The Tempe Police substation is on the corner).

The dog park itself is absolutely huge-much, much bigger than the one we used to go to in Ohio. The times we have been to the park, there have been about 15-20 dogs which is a good amount. There are benches for the owners to sit on, as well as some picnic tables. Additionally, there are bags for dog poop and faucets for water, so if you forget bottled water it's no problem.  All of the dogs and owners we have met at the park are very friendly and nice.  We have not yet encountered an aggressive dog, and all of the owners watch their dogs very well.

Sophie has so much fun running around and playing and is always worn out by the time we get in the car to come home. She even found the last remaining puddle from the rain last week and managed to get muddy :)",2

8664,2,1547424000000,"This is a really nice Thai restaurant on a festive looking street in the heart of Scottsdale.  I ate here last night while on a first date.  It's a very nice place for a date or an evening out.  Most of the other people in the the restaurant seemed to be paired up, although I'm sure they can arrange for larger groups.  The waitress was very pleasant and attentive the whole time.  All the food was extremely colorful and pleasing to look at, and also very tasty, as were their cocktails..  This place is very good for vegetarians because they have a vegetarian section in their menu, saving the trouble of having to search through the menu looking for vegetarian stuff.  I ordered the Hippy Noodle, which was tofu with noodles and vegetables.  It was really good.  My date had the basil chicken, which also looked really good.  I had the creme brulee for dessert, which was excellent.

I would give this place five stars except that my food was a little too spicy.  They ask you at the beginning how spicy you want your food on a scale of 1-5, and I asked for a 3, which the waitress said was a very tolerable level.  I was expecting a moderately spicy meal, but it turned out to be a little more than that.  I had to take a sip of water after every bite, and my sinuses were about to fire up.  I was on a date so I figured it would be better to eat less food rather than fight through the spiciness and have watery eyes and a runny nose.  Not attractive.  

The whole street is full of art galleries, and it would have been really nice to have been able to walk down the street and browse through them after dinner, but everything on the street closes a little early.  

Overall, this was a really good experience.  The whole bill came out to be $60, and that includes drinks, entrees, and dessert.  I thought it was very reasonable.",2

I came across this little place in the plaza next to Vaughan Mills mall one day. I thought to myself, sure, why not give it a try. 

What I found great about this place was that everything tasted very ""home made"". It doesn't feel like mass produced food like the other Pho restaurants. The beef broth was piping hot and full of beef flavor, and the noodles were cooked just right. The shrimp was well cleaned and no veins in sight!!! That actually impressive me quite a bit! The vegetables (bean sprouts, shredded carrots and cucumbers) are neatly tucked in the side of the bowl and tasted very fresh. Wow..what a great bowl of Pho! 

I think this place is a great find. Prices are great and the lady at the counter is always nice and friendly. The place is kept pretty clean as well!  Usually you see pushing carts with dirty dishes sitting in a corner but not this place. 

Also I recommend ordering drinks from the menu. I always ordered the Mango milk shake and man, was that good! It is made fresh, tastes like mango, not some artificial mango flavouring. I have yet to try their bubble tea but trust that it will be great as well. 

If you feel like a hot bowl of Pho in winter days come to this place. It won't disappoint!",2

Good luck and enjoy the good food. Cause there sure aren't any in LA.

8721,3,1547510400000,"T-RexXx ( carnivorous) . I know that grilled plate need to be change before food get burnt.  But their  grilled plate already have black burned n black sticky oil on it. I prefer picnic garden ( nyc) grill bar n grill plate. 
1. Sapporo draft beer. The best for my nite and price is reasonable for jar on monday . 
2.  short beef ribs. Really tender n juicy,  unless u grilled too much. But my second time order, they don't give me the amount I want. May be I eat too much already. 
3. Shrimp, squid, salmon r ok. 
4. Ox tongue. Not available. 
Mostly students are here and prices are reasonable.  
I was business trip to toronto and I found this restaurant from yelp. So I give a shot and its ok. I told myself that I should go for korean restaurant instead of bbq buffet joint.
Most important for me is i feel like my grilled plate is way too burnt but no one  change it or ask. I am not sure how much dark burnt charcoal meat .me and my wife eat.
Overall. I will look for higher rating joint in toronto for next visit.",2

I waited a few minutes, the did the ol' hello! She never smiled, never even said hello. Simply stared at me....no smile, just stare! I placed my order, waited and she brought it out, and NEVER said one more word, not even when I paid 14.00 for a plate of BBQ, 1 oz of slaw, 4 hush puppies, and three cold onion rings.

I got a split (half french fries, half onion rings,) and while the fries were pretty good I just wasn't too crazy about the onion rings. They taste kind of like a bloomin' onion, but something was missing.

My regular optometrist moved her office to Henderson so I thought it would not be a big deal to go somewhere closer to get my annual prescription.  I explained very clearly at the beginning that I was NOT interested  in LASIK  and was simply there for an eye exam to get a renewed prescription.  From the time I walked in, until the time I left, the entire staff did their part to try to and sell me the LASIK  procedure. They had me do an unnecessary test which later I learned was used to determine if I would be a good candidate for LASIK.  Finally after my exam was completed, they had me sit with a LASIK  consultant/coordinator to go over prices for LASIK!  Cynthia Payne did an adequate job on my exam, but I don't appreciate the sales pitch, unnessary test, and the waste of my time for their own agenda.

He ended up having platform frames for much cheaper than anywhere else I had looked that were solid wood and nice quality.

- broken freezer that melted our ice cream

- no dishes initially provided, and it took three calls to room service and multiple hours to get the right amount sent to room

I was just eating dinner nearby this place when I saw the molds and signs of cake from the window display. Uh cake? YAH, count me in. The walnut looking things are called hodo kwaja in Korean. They have fillings of potato and red bean. I was already sold at cake, and red bean so my boyfriend and I ordered 6 for I believe 2.75. Not bad! Then again, these babies are pretty small.

8876,3,1547337600000,"After reading many reviews for Momocho, I feel a bit foolish about what I'm about to post:  Raving about cucumber margaritas.  Gushing about goat cheese in guacamole.  Obsessive food-love for machaca brisket and carnitas.  It's been said before by many, many yelpers.  But, it all bears repeating.  

Momocho is a gem.  It is a food experience.  Each course challenges the notions you had about Mexican cuisine.  It makes you measure all of those other places: Places that get by with fillers like rice and refried beans, various unintelligible meats in sauces, and the classics... and it makes all of the aspects of ""old"" Mexican food obsolete.  I'm dreading my next trip to quickie burrito joints or to sit-down margarita restaurants.  I know it won't compare to the meal at Momocho.  

The food alone would be worth enduring any level of service, short of being beaten by a rusty spatula, (and even then, I might consider staying for an extra round of carnitas...), but the entire staff at Momocho was exceptional.  Our server, (Brooke), was attentive without hovering.  She was skilled at the art of server conversation, (adding to the atmosphere of the restaurant without being a distraction or monopolizing the conversation.), and was just a wonderful addition to the experience.  

I live two hours from Momocho.  My waistline and wallet are very glad that I'm not a local resident.  I will be going back again, and again, and again.

Viva Momocho!",2

The mango salsa was tasty, but the fish was kind of hard to taste with all the toppings piled on. I took out a bite of fish just to taste it, and it was dry.  My boyfriend had the fish and chips, and the breading on the fish was very dark.  Maybe left in the fryer too long?  Maybe my expectations were high with all the great reviews, or it is just a matter of taste, but I expected more attention to the fish.  I have not been to the other locations.  It may be a different experience.",1

I will agree with the other reviews which state that the sauce is very bland--and they liberally slather it on.  Both ends of the ribs were so tough that they were inedible, and the spine section was liberally coated in fat which I had to cut away.  $40 for two--no drinks.  Did not leave hungry!

Check in was easy, and staff friendly.  They give you a coupon book and we used plenty of the coupons for items in the casino.  There is a parking garage which is nice in the hot sun.  Our room had two queen beds, and it was a rather large room and was clean.   The only bad thing was the room looked into the side of a building, which made the room dark.   Other room locations are probably be better.  

There are loads of restaurants and plenty of bars from which to choose.  We tried many of them and were pleased with them all.    The movie theatre was very nice and the bowling alleys are great.   We wished there had been a rodeo when we were there because it would have been fun.  The poker room was great and there are many choices of slot machines.

This trip may have convinced me to get away from the madness of the Strip.   Even all the guests were nice and normal and friendly.   We didn't find drunk people hanging around being annoying.",2
8892,3,1548547200000,"My fav seafood buffet on this side of town. We went Sunday for dinner and it was $18.99 all day. Might be pricey to some but for the amount of seafood and good quality seafood, I wouldn't mind paying it. Everything tasted good. I would go back just for the sashimi alone. 
As part of the grand opening they gave each table some lobster. It was super tasty and hope they have it as something you can order in the future. Lord only knows if they have it on the buffet, one person would just take it all. 
Service was great and for a buffet, that says a lot. The hostess was super nice and our waitress was very attentive.

8904,1,1548547200000,"At this point will always hold this spot close to my heart as it was the first vegan spot that I came to while in Canada!! 

One of the coolest vibes/decorations in a restaurant and even the area it's in is very holistic, raw, and real (to say the least). The first thing that caught my eye was walking up to the front and seeing the sign out front that plainly has VEGAN written in huge letters (kudos!). 

The second neat thing had of been the small ""fine print"" that they had on the front of their menus about even though the food may say it contains meat it's all imaginary (I got a good laugh out of that. 

My girlfriend and I went a little crazy and ordered the following: All day breakfast, chicken pot pie (not chickens were harmed in making this), cheese sticks, and Mac n cheese balls. As much as we tried to finish all of this we couldn't. I personally got the chicken pot pie for myself (with a side of the jalapeño poppers) and it was outstanding! Full of flavor, the ""meat"" in it looks so real and the crust was perfect (not to much and not to little). Overall I was very happy with my choice! My girlfriends scramble was amazing, the flavoring they add is out of this world (no pun intended) and the sautéed spinach they add is a good finisher. As for the two appetizers if I had to pick I'd say the cheese sticks were my favorite, they were vey tasty. 

Overall I would highly recommend this spot to anyone that's in the area and doesn't want to the hassle of altering their plates to be vegan since it's all vegan! Plus they have amazing desserts (cheesecake specially); sadly we were to full to try but it looked mouthwatering!",2

They have a few mocktails on the drink menu, which was perfect for this future mama to be flying solo for what will be the last time for a while. The Nola Mule was great - perfectly sweetened with pineapple. The bread was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and arrived warm from the oven served with herb butter - delish. Then for my simple meal of lobster bisque: the broth was smooth and flavorful with a nice amount of lobster. Served in a soup bowl with a puff pastry on top, which helped soak up the broth do that none was left behind. Excelent. The chef brought a smoked salmon with kumquat vinaigrette which was very nice!  Then arrived green apple cotton candy courtesy of the chef as well. I'm glad I chose not to order dessert! This was the perfect treat to end a magical evening and transported me yet to another time and place. How can you forget the way cotton candy melts in your mouth?! Delightful. What an amazing meal for a relatively small bill for such a swanky restaurant. Would love the chance to dine here again and anticipate it would be another special evening.",2

As for the inside, I have no clue about it and really don't remember it that much. Hmmmm....that can't be a good sign. But I blame it either on beer or the fact that I always sat outside (even in the fall, again, big hmmmm). The first thing I ever ordered there was the BBQ Mahi Tacos and I never strayed from it because I loved it so much.

After some time passed, he again came over to tell us our food was coming up. When I gave him a confused look, he explained that the salmon was taking longer.  Seriously? I told him that salmon does not take this long to grill. When we finally received our food, I had a sliver of salmon and a truly ordinary handful of salad...for $12.99.

Stand out dishes were the sashimi combo (especially the most insane scallop sashimi I've ever had), the crab hush puppies, the calamari, and the kimchi fried rice with pork belly.

They are often doing ""tastings"" giving super tiny samples of TERRIBLE selections, the worst of the worst, the lowest common denominator.  At least when the LCBO does tastings there are representatives from the wineries and you have a shot at it being good, not so here.


Government Created Monopoly & The Consequences
I'm truly sick of Ontario's liquor laws and the government created monopolies like the LCBO and this private (owned by Vincor) sort-of-exception.  Here's a wine store that sells only one company's wine?  Result: Higher prices than more free parts of this country or others and less unique selections.",3

Of course, due to draconian Ohio laws, the wine is more expensive and available on a more limited basis, and sometimes the produce leaves something to be desired.  However, the frozen meats and prepared foods are excellent and very reasonable.

From general reviews, there seems to be a problem with either employees being too attentive or not attentive at all. However, I didn't have a problem them. Employees were always there, but didn't disturb you much unless you had question. They did demonstrate a few products, so that was nice. 

Overall, I only brought around $20 worth of purchases, but that still earned me some samples and a bag of samples for spending $20. When you're checking out, they'll ask you for your skin type and give you the appropriate samples.

I order too much every single time I come (it's hard to make up my mind as they offer so many of my favorite foods), but it's okay because they will always wrap up my leftovers and they're just as good to eat the next day.

My advice: try the charity bread and the fresh mozzarella! I cannot stress this enough. Both are SO GOOD! 

I've never had a problem getting a table, and the wait staff has always been friendly and attentive (without being obnoxious).

And their chips for salsa- were thick and perfectly made. It was so good we went back for breakfast! Something we never do as we want to try different places.  Breakfast was the best!!!

It's modernized for the American and young crowd, but you can still taste the original cooking style within the sauce and broth. It might be on the pricey side but it was definitely worth the experience.

I had the Steak and Eggs which is basically Bò lúc lc and I gotta say it was great. The steak was tender, juicy and had that similar taste of A1 sauce while the fried rice complimented the beef really well. It balanced out the rich taste of the sauce. The portion size was comparable to the price.

We ordered the Small Family Special, 24 wings with two sauces and a 16"" one topping pizza ($26.99, extra toppings $1.75)  We had pepperoni and added sausage and extra cheese.  We also ordered potato skins and carrots and celery with ranch.  All this food was only $41 and some change.  Super fair pricing with more food for your money in my opinion. 

Long Wong's didn't disappoint on the wings.  We had garlic parmesan and BBQ.  The wings were big and perfectly cooked with just little crunch.   The garlic parmesan is a white saucex nice and garlicky but not overpowering.   The BBQ was just right, not to tangy, not too sweet.  

The pizza was big and super cheesy with extra cheese on it.  The slices were big too.  You will definitely be full.

The potato skins were delicious with yummy cheese and bacon.  The order was nice sized, I think 10 halves for $5.75.  Definitely a great value! 

The large order of carrots and celery with ranch was only $1.75 and I was glad to see this on the menu.  It's a must have item when eating pizza and wings.

All in all, this place was a fabulous way to end a hectic week.  Everyone was pleasantly fed for a fair price and the order was prepared quickly.  Nice staff too!  We will be back!",3

9032,1,1547769600000,"I started coming here for work lunch meetings years ago, back before I was even 21. I was told it's the best menu in town, regardless of what food is on it. Years later, I still agree that it's hilarious bringing newcomers here just to read the menu.

The drink menu is massive and overwhelming, and when you ask for a recommendation they will usually tell you to go with a seasonal item (cocktails or beers) or a manhattan (they also have a full page menu of manhattans.) They currently have a pumpkin sangria that is to die for. The patio is always packed, even when it's cold out, because it's pretty fab.

The drinks aren't cheap, which is a bummer. Luckily the cocktails really are pretty special, though. Happy hour is good for beers, but that's about all. If you're looking for cocktails to please the manliest of men to the girliest of girls, go to Harris Grill. He can get a manhattan and she can get a dessert chocolate and baileys concoction, or something.

I've been here for all kinds of reasons, but I think it's best for snacks and drinks. The food menu has some Pittsburgh specialties that I would recommend for fun and for out-of-towners, but I've also had many ""tots n beers"" nights that have hit the spot perfectly. (The vego chili is also perfect to pair with a meal or as a snack).

Sometimes the drinks are better than others. I have ordered the same manhattan and the same bloody mary on different nights, and they were worlds apart. That is disappointing, but Harris Grill has always got something to make up for any pitfalls.",2

It is the best choice in the neighborhood and is consistent.

It is our go-to place when we have friends come in from out of town and they want to eat close to our house as we know that we are guaranteed a memorable time. Casual and always buzzing. Great for birthdays. 

The Salmon is really good. The Osso Bucco is a favorite of my SOs, and the Calamari is tasty, as is the Gnocchi.

The ""Sides"" are not really worth it. They are small portions and are always left over.  If you order a couple of things and share tapas style, you get the best value. A decent bottle of wine is $40.",3

The point of this review is not to highlight their food.  Honestly, their food is top notch for the most part.  Never any complaints here.  My review is to highlight an over served regular customer who made every other customer uncomfortable who walked into this establishment.  I understand that servers cannot control the behavior of their patrons, but to allow a customer to be beligerantly rude and disrupt others is not good business.  Some servers seemed to play his little game and egg him on.  Other servers seemed agitated with his antics but didn't do anything to handle the situation (and honestly I do not expect them to, I expect a manager to.)

A huge part of how I choose where to dine is due to the ambiance of the place.  If I feel uncomfortable, chances are I will not be going back.  If my girlfriend is uncomfortable, chances are we are never going back.

This pizza has been our favorite for years and we rarely deviate. The potatoes are thinly sliced, the pancetta and Gorgonzola are perfect compliments. We tried it on the whole wheat crust for the first time and it didn't disappoint so if you prefer whole wheat give it a try! We always get the egg on the pizza and recommend you so too! We also always get a salad to go with and there isn't a bad choice on the menu. Last night we had the chopped chicken. It's a great blend of ingredients and the pine nuts add a nice crunch. Do yourself a favor and check out Nellos soon. You can't go wrong with anything on this menu, we've tried almost everything and NEVER had a subpar meal. The customer service here is always top notch as well. Family friendly but also good for a date night. Tip:  If you order the Yukon gold pizza, get the egg!!!

We ordered a small house salad, with grilled chicken and a personal pizza.  It took over 30 minutes to get the salad.  We finished the salad and was told the pizza would be out soon.  I was drinking ice tea.  The waitress re-filled it, and when I took a sip it wasn't tea - it was coffee.  I told the waitress about it, and her response was they don't service coffee, and got me a fresh drink. At one point a server stopped by to ask if we had our pizza.  Forty-five minutes later I went to find her to tell her to bring us our check for the salad, ice tea and soda as we were leaving.  Before they brought the check, the pizza arrived - in a to go carton.  I told them we didn't want it, and then we had to wait for the manager to deduct it from our check.  Manager never came out - they said they were slow because they had a new cook, yet other, larger tables were being served in less time.  Ironically, one of the handicap parking spots in front of the restaurant had a 15 min parking limit.  Not sure you could get much in that amount of time.

My test took me to 204 questions and this is what I can recollect of it: I had 3 EKG questions, 1 math question, medication questions galore, and the rest consisted of SATA and priority questions.

Words can not describe the feeling that is finally setting in for me... I am a registered nurse and it was all due to my Rachell Allen family.  For those who do not know me, this was my thrid time that I have taken the NCLEX-RN from the time that I graduated from nursing school in December 2014.  I tried everything from Kaplan, to Hurst, Exam Cram just to name a few.  I thought this would be a hurdle that I could never get over.  But by the grace of God, my mother's co-worker had recommended the Rachell Allen review that she had also used herself and my mother had signed me up.  Although I was originally reluctant, I had nothing to lose and much to gain.  

Not only did this program condense and narrow the material, but it gave me the confidence that I needed all along, and I began believing in myself once more. Everyday I listened to the audio that we listened to in class to get my head motivated; I made sure that I had a regular study schedule in between the Rachell Allen content, UWorld, and LaCharity --- PDA; refocused at every moment that I needed; and most importantly I finally trusted my nursing instinct. I had finally realized it was there all along.  I pray that you all get the confidence that you need my friends.  You are all capable and can do anything you set your mind to.  You can do it!

You can tell they take pride in their BBQ as each piece was grilled to perfection.  I really enjoyed the meat jun (Seasoned ribeye dipped in egg before pan frying) especially with their dipping sauce.  The banchan (free refill) that came before the meal was also delicious, well seasoned bean sprouts, kim chee and radish. The owner/server was very nice to us and even gave my wife an extra cup of their specialty Korean tea to go.  We also had some fresh peanuts that just finished boiling in Hawaiian sea salt.

We didn't do the dinner portion because we had plans to dine elsewhere after the show.

My hubby & I perused the extensive menu which had helpful pictures and star ratings for their most popular dishes. There are quite a few choices of appetizers like satay skewers and green mango or papaya or shrimp salads although we opted to forego the apps in order to try more main dishes. We ordered the pork Penang, a beautifully peanutty, slightly spicy curry dish served with green beans. I really enjoy the Penang curry at Thai Basil in Richmond Hill but this version at Nimman is an equally (if not more) delicious version IMO by nature of the sauce being less thick and having that refreshing kick that keeps you coming back for more. 

We also ordered the chicken with long song sauce, and crispy cashew chicken. Of the dishes we ordered, the long song chicken was just ok but was served over rice and came with a bit of Thai shrimp paste, which added a slight saltiness and slight tanginess that elevated the dish. 
My husband has long been trying to find a Toronto Thai restaurant that can replicate his favourite cashew chicken (""H6"") from a popular Houston Thai place called Kanomwan. Most restaurants have fallen short of his memory of his beloved Kanomwan cashew chicken. The crispy cashew chicken at Nimman is prepared with thinly battered chicken pieces, some bell peppers, onions, thinly sliced carrots, orange slices, and of course, cashews. Although Nimman's version was not quite the thick barely-there sauce that my hubby recalls, it was very very tasty. The crispy chicken pieces add a lovely texture contrast. We are excited to come back here to try it again with a custom order for the chef to make the sauce a bit thicker. 

I'm not sure about other patrons who have had challenges with the service, but we found the wait staff to be very attentive and helpful, especially as far as discussing and suggesting how to custom order the crispy cashew chicken to make it closer to the way my hubby wants it.

Food pricing is reasonable. 3 main dishes and an extra bowl of rice came to ~$43. Although Mimico is a good 40 minute drive from where we live, we will definitely come back.

9198,3,1547424000000,"DO NOT USE -- OWNER IS RUDE AND STAFF UNHELPFUL

When I got in my car and drove away, I noticed the back window was a quarter of the way rolled down. It would not roll back up or down. No one said anything about it to me while I was there or when I left.

They claimed it was broken when I pulled in, yet no one said anything. I was in my car, opening and closing the door all day moving so I would have noticed if the window were down in any way. It will not stay up more than 3/4 of the way so it is a noticeable difference.

When I asked to speak to the manager, he kept saying ""Like you said, it's an electrical issue"" which I never said, so I asked to speak with the owner. He was gone for the day and I was told he did not have a phone (yeah, really) So I said I'd wait until they figured it out because I needed to speak with him before leaving.

The owner called me after sitting there for 15 mins and said that instead of running it through the tunnel (how is that 100% hand wash??) they had to hand wash it which is a $30 job and I should be appreciative that they worked so hard to accommodate me. He then told me that I don't know a thing about cars (in as rude of a way it sounds) if I was blaming them for the issue and that my car is old and these things happen. Yes, my car is old. However, if it was such an inconvenience to clean my car, why wasn't I told?? My whole point was that I was 100% unaware of any problem, so yes it seems like the one factor that is different was them.

In the end, the owner took no responsibility, offered nothing but recommending someone to fix it (again, in a condescending way as if I was five-years-old) and did nothing but make me feel small and insignificant. I can't believe there are still people like this in the world that find nothing better to do than make people cry. He could have at least offered to repay the wash fee, anything but he took the low road in blaming me and my car.

I have taken my car here at least twice without incident because of the 100% hand wash. I found out today that is a lie.

I had the drunken noodles, which is my usual order if they don't have pad see ew. Although the flavors were there and they didn't shy away from spice which is something I appreciate, there were just too few noodles in my dish. I found myself hunting and digging within my vegetables to find the noodles to eat. I think they could have lessened the amount of bell peppers and broccoli a significant amount to find a better balance. I'd have to come here again to see if this was a fluke or if they consistently don't add enough noodles. This is why I'm giving it 4 stars, because if it is a fluke and they usually give more, it would be an excellent dish. 

My friend had one of their curries which she did enjoy, although it wasn't the best she's ever had. She also ordered an avocado bubble tea and while it was good, it was definitely coconut flavored instead of the avocado she ordered.

What was the casting call like for that gig?

They have mostly ridden themselves of the Star Trek Next Generation theme in one of their central casinos, except for the remnants of Star Trek I saw in the men's room:  Klingon images, and a spacey interior.

This recession has hit Vegas kind of hard, and it might partially be my projected negativity on the mood of the city while we were there for a trade show, but Vegas seems a little sad right now.

My aforementioned dining partners, luckily, didn't have quite as bad an experience as me. However, they certainly didn't seem to enjoy their dinners and commented on how bland the food was.

As for me, I wish my food was bland. It sure beats the taste of bitter, burnt plastic that overwhelmed my poor noodles.

Had a midweek stay in 10/2011 in a queen tower room at a great rate. Room was redone recently - Bahamian/Charleston style (British Imperial dark wood and pineapple motif.) Beds were not pillow-top but supportive and comfortable. Nice seating area with coffee table. Fold down secretary makes for a good work station. Downside was the bathroom. Not updated. Clean and maintained but tight and dated tile work. Shower head was a little too low but there was a window to open for fresh air.

Overall a great location for visiting downtown, decent, clean accommodations and lower table limits in the casino. (Aging crowd for the most part on the floor but in Vegas all are equal at the table.)

May 2012 - stayed in a Cabana Suite room - funky fancy old motel room - awesome bathroom but room itself is small (old motel refurbished.)

9373,3,1548028800000,"I saw this show in early Nov. 2017 after hearing about how great it is via a Vegas podcast. 

Good show, but not great. I like it, don't get me wrong. There are some fun tricks. Some of the tricks are variations of classic tricks, so there's nothing new about them, but they're entertaining and fun to see. 

My girlfriend said she could see a few things that more or less tipped her off about the trick. I didn't notice any of his secrets, but I could guess how they were done. That didn't matter, it was the showmanship that mattered, and it was very good. 

The interactive elements of the show were fun, and since I had ""VIP"" seats, I wound up being part of one of his tricks. That was a nice bonus. But it's a modest theater, you aren't being cheated if you don't pay extra to sit up front. 

A few of the segments weren't so much magical as they were theatrical, and that didn't impress me so much. I didn't come to watch great choreography, I wanted great magic. Xavier has a great trick at the end, but it lacks the jaw dropping element that you want from the finale. 

Overall it's a good show, but it wasn't spectacular. As he tweaks the show, perhaps it has become more to my liking, but without a big finish and dumping the cute choreography that's not really magical, I can't give it more than 3 stars.",1
9385,3,1548547200000,"This place is DELICIOUS.
My wife and I came here for the first time and for sure we were expecting with our cravings going crazy.  
We walked in and were greeted with happy welcoming staff. Thats what good customer service is supposed to make everyone feel and they did a great job.
They had their menu in black chalk boards which shows that they can change things if they needed to and variety is always good.  They have a printed full sized menu, and they showed us their best sellers.
My wife got her favorited drink the Okinawa and i got the Hokkaido. 
My goodness our cravings were more than satisfied, we wish this place was in our hometown San Diego, CA!
They even offered that if our drinks werent up to our expectations that theyre willing to switch it out!  
So those of you out of town and are looking for delicious milk tea, head over here and grab a delicious sweet drink!",2
9389,2,1546992000000,"This is as good as it gets. Upon coming here, you can notice that it is very similar to an authentic udon bar found in Japan (as said by my boyfriend, who has been to many udon places in Japan). When you come in, you see a display of plastic udon bowls, giving an example of what to expect. It's similar to a buffet line; you grab a tray and tell the chefs what you want. After you grab your udon or rice bowl, you are lead to a line of 8-10 different types of tempura. You grab a plate and get as many or as little tempura pieces as you want. At the very end of the line, you end up at the cash register and pay for your food. 

Now to the food. The food here is AMAZING. The udon was clearly fresh and had a good bite to it. The broth was tasty and not overpowering. The beef pieces were thinly sliced and tender. The tempura were all crispy and the veggies used for them (as I had the pumpkin and sweet potato) were lightly seasoned and delicious. The surprising part of the meal was how delicious their lemonade was! It's sweet but not too sweet while having a slight tartness to it. In addition, it also had a hint of the lemon rind in the drink. 

If you really enjoy your udon, do yourself a favor and try this authentic Japanese place out.",3

Come to find out there was just ONE girl working the front. She was bartending, hostessing, serving and doing take out orders. She was friendly and helpful, but I felt bad and couldn't help but feel like they needed one more person to work the front. I ordered the southern hospitality and it was pretty decent. I've honestly never had anything like it before but the service was just slow, and I couldn't be mad at that poor girl basically working the restaurant by herself. It took about 15 minutes for my take out order to be ready. Not entirely bad. They need to just work on the slow service.",2

My pedicure took over an hour, she did not clip my nails on one side, did not do the standard pedicure steps in order, the massage was only done on my legs and hurt, finally someone else had to step in to finish.

1. The restaurant & bar remind me of legit-Irish bars that I went to in the nice areas of Dublin.  The bar and decor are perfect for creating an Irish pub setting to get dinner with your kids or have some beer with your friends or to watch a baseball game at the bar.  

2.  The food is great.  They have a great brunch menu featuring legit-Irish breakfasts that are the same as the ones I've had in Dublin.  Their sandwiches and burgers are really good and their mac n cheese is heavenly.",2

Be prepared to wait during peak hours as this place always does a steady business (at all their locations).  I often call ahead and order take out.  I've had nearly everything on the menu.  The Vietnamese Salad rolls are really light and yummy.  Can't go wrong with the orange peel chicken.  Oh, and the honey seared shrimp is great too...however that one needs to be eaten at the restaurant...it's like an In & Out burger & fries...best eaten ASAP.",2

Happy hour is from 5 to 8pm Monday through Friday with martinis at 1/2 price, house wine is 1/2 price... and all appetizers are 1/2 price. I think cocktails and beer are discounted too.

It's refreshing to be able to walk into a bar and not see a video poker machine. Unlike some of the other reviews where people were mingling with others... we kept to ourselves and had a great time.

The crowd was similar to who I'd expect to see at the Whiskey at Green Valley Ranch.

They really opened up the old bar that was here, and I like the spacious layout and clear view with windows all the way around. My only concern would be, even when it is a slightly busy, it may be 1/3 full, which doesn't always help the atmosphere.  I also noticed the entertainment area, with pool, darts, pop-a-shot, etc...and immediately thought, sweet, I can bring the kids. Plenty of TV's and it seems like a good spot to catch a game. We sat at the bar and were welcomed and served by a very nice bartender. The bar itself is not all that impressive, but the service and beer menu were. The beer menu had a nice mix of styles and included some locals (Four Peaks, O.H.S.O, and others.) B2 will have a chance to earn a fifth star my next stop in.

9520,1,1548547200000,"I am originally from Scottsdale, but I live In NYC now.  I am in town and my parents took me to Kelly's last night.  I don't typically write reviews whether the restaurant is good or bad, but this place was so awful, I thought I owed it to society to warn you about this place.  

Right when we showed up  the hostess looked like she had just gotten in a fight with her boyfriend and had a disgusted scowl on her face...she said we could sit anywhere.  Patio is nice so I was able to ignore the rude entrance.  We chose a table on the patio and it literally took 7 minutes for someone to even acknowledge our existence and finally bring us water.  Just as they did that, we realized the table cloth was absolutely filthy.  So we decided to just move to another table...once we sat down there, we realized that table was not sturdy at all and had to move to a 3rd table.  While this was going on, I mentioned to the waiter that we had to move bec the table cloth was filthy...2 minutes later I saw another waiter come and I was happy to see they were addressing the dirty cloth. However, I soon realized, instead of putting a clean cloth on, they just turned it inside out.  Same thing you would do with a stained couch cushion.

Moving along, we are now at our 3rd table and I could feel there was something strange under the cloth. I lifted the cloth up and the table looked to be at least 30 years old and was fully rotting away.  I still cannot understand how that table was not thrown out years ago, but I guess they figured a dirty table cloth would at least keep the customers from getting any splinters.

At this point I just wanted to eat and get the hell out of there.  I ordered a cheeseburger medium rare and I think to them that means to sear the meat for 5 seconds. It is pretty hard to screw up a cheeseburger, but they succeeded in this also.  It was awful and I didn't even eat 1/2 of it.

With all of this going on, the entire staff looked miserable and were extremely unfriendly.  I'm not sure if it was just a bad night for every single employee, but I work hard at my job and a smile is not too much to ask for.

I could probably type a lot more about my hour long experience at Kelly's, but hopefully this helps you avoid this place.  You could not pay me to go back and it definitely falls within my top 5 all time worst dining experiences.",2

We built our zones online and they were delivered surprisingly in less than 45 minutes, which was good.

My girlfriend got a chicken, bacon and cheese zone while I built a steak, spinach and potato zone. Both were surprisingly tasty. My zone cost nearly $9, I knew steak was an upcharge but it seemed oddly expensive and the website did not have an itemized list of the upcharges for various ingredients. Both the zones were pretty good and were a big enough portion to save a little for the next day. D.P. Dough is very good drunk food.

My big qualm was with the delivery itself. I received a call from the delivery driver stating that he was outside my building. I ran all the way downstairs and met the guy practically in the street. My building does not require a keycode or buzzer to get in. I'm really not sure why he didn't come up.

When we walked in, the owner was the one taking the orders. He asked if we had been there before, and when we said no, he explained the whole menu to us. He was SO personable! After we had gotten our food, he checked on our table outside to see how everything was. His service was outstanding, and I wish every place I went to had this great of service. It also helps that is french accent is to DIE for ;)

Ok, so onto the meal. I had the chicken pesto sandwich special. It was FULL of flavor. Sundried tomato pesto really made the whole sandwich pop. The bread was fresh, soft and chewy. It matched the sandwich perfectly. The chicken was delicious as well. It was perfectly cooked, and not dry. I seriously can't even say how awesome this place is! 

My table also split the chocolate tart. Can you say HEAVEN? Cause that's where I was when I was devouring it. It's rich and creamy. The slice was HUGE, and enough for 4 people to share.  I kinda want to go back just for that!

Either Prime or Bellagio restaurant reservations somehow lost my reservation I made for my anniversary night.

It was an understatement to say I was upset. I made these reservations weeks ago...

However, when we arrived, the prime windows seat for 2 people were taken, but there was one still left, and they sat us there. Even though for some reason, the traditional water show did not go off, we were delighted to get the table with the view.

9540,2,1546646400000,"We won't be going back to this place.  The only good part about the experience was the drinks.  The Thai tea is great.  The food was okay but nothing special.  The decor needs a major update and the restaurant could use a good cleaning.  Someone needs to call Robert Irvine.  

The two things that make this place a 1 star review are the service and the price.  The service was some of the worst service that I've ever had in a restaurant.  We order three entrees and an appetizer.  After waiting about 15 minutes, our first entree arrived.  Somewhere in the next 5-10 minutes our appetizer arrived and then finally about 5 minutes after that the remaining two entrees arrived.  

We finished eating and had some food left over.  After about 10 minutes of the waitress ignoring our table, we decided to stack the dishes in order to get her attention.  Yeah, that didn't work.  We waited and tried to get her attention and after another 15 minutes we were successful.  We asked for To Go boxes and put our remaining food into the containers.  

After receiving the check, I was surprised at how much the bill was for the meal.  It definitely was not worth the price.  At this point, I just wanted to pay and get out of the place.  I placed my Amex card into the card slot adorned with American Express logo next to the statement of them ""gladly accepting American Express"" to be told by the waitress that they don't take American Express.  I don't know if I was more shocked by contradiction in credit card adornment or by the fact that the waitress was actually at our table.

I paid the bill, left a normal tip, since the waitress was hovering around cleaning the table as I tried to fill out the bill.  I then did a balancing trick with our takeout boxes since I wasn't afforded the luxury of a bag (maybe you need to spend more in order to receive a bag) and hurried out of the place with my family.

This gym didn't open on time, where it was advertised at the other gym on 67th and Peoria that it was to open at the end of July 2016.  That was something I was looking forward to only to find out on a notice on the window that the opening date was pushed back.  The biggest qualm here with me is that there is no sauna or jacuzzi here.  This is one of the main reasons I love the gym because of its amenities.  

So if you're looking for a sauna or jacuzzi, this gym isn't for you.  The pool is also considerably smaller as well.  As a whole, this gym is a lot smaller than the old location on 67th and Peoria.  I do like that it is modern and has wooden floors, but that's about it.  The gym is ok and will do because it's close to my house.  There are also fewer machines of everything, which is probably due to lack of space.  No raquetball courts here either.  Overall, a nice looking gym lacking several key amenities.

9553,3,1546646400000,"I used to order pizza from this place all the time when I worked in the area but haven't tried them in a few years. So, realizing different locations are owned by different people, and knowing I currently DON'T care for the one closest to my home, I thought I would try the Strongsville location to see if it has held up. This Strongsville E.O.C.P. often places coupons in local publications. I found one for a medium, two-item pizza for $8.00, so I ordered one with mushrooms and pepperoni. 

Out of the box, the medium pizza was 11 1/2 inches across, with approximately a 3/4 inch edge of crust. Fairly standard and acceptable in my estimation. The thin crust was just about the way I like it, crisp and golden on the bottom and soft and chewy, even the edge. The entire pie was about one inch thick. The sauce tasted good, with a slight tang or acidity to it. On another positive note, the mushrooms seemed to be fresh and not out-of-the-can by the way they cooked (baked) up. I thought the pie could have spent another 2-3 minutes in the oven to cook up the pepperoni and bubble up and slightly brown the cheese. But then again that might have resulted in a tougher, hard crust. So, even the next day, whether eating the leftovers cold or after heating in the microwave, the crust was still just as good.

Overall I tip my hat to The East Of Chicago Pizza in Strongsville, they seem to still be doing a credible job. Since northeast Ohio has some of the best independent pizza places you can find anywhere in the country (I know, I've tried many of them during my travels.), I usually don't buy pizza from the national chains. For this location I don't mind making an exception.",2

On top was a ""basted"" egg. It looked poached to me and was perfectly cooked. I opted for the country potatoes as well. I like my breakfast potatoes rather crispy and these came out just how I like them (Pic posted. With a bite already taken ). This dish is big enough to share. I might opt for the 1/2 order next time.

9570,2,1546905600000,"Hung out with my daughter, her hubby and his brother and they all wanted to go check out the Mission at Minder Binder, so off we went. 

It was around 5pm Saturday night and we got there we were told that seating in the opened patio area (by the fire pits & fire place) is a self-serve area and that the bar outside was not opened yet that we would need to go inside to order drinks & food so we opted to be waiting on and found a table in the covered patio area.

 After inquiring what they had on tap I went with a Wasatch Apricot Hefeweizen , I have to say, this is a pretty good beer, my favorite is the Four Peak's Peach Ale, and well this one comes in a close 2nd.

After drinks were ordered it was time to figure out the food, we ordered 2 pizzas, the Sister Margarite and the Mahalo. The pizzas came out one at a time, don't know if there was a backup in the kitchen.

The Sister Margarite was the 1st pizza to reach our table, it was your basic marinara sauce, roma tomatoes, garlic & basil and cheese. I really didn't care for this pizza, it just tasted bland.

Then the 2nd pizza came out when the 1st one was done, did they think the boys wouldn't have put away both pizzas? I have to say the 2nd pizza was delish, it had Applewood Smoked BACON and sweet pineapples, this was a yummy pizza.

 For me, Mission @ Minder Binder is a spot to end the night with a beer by the fire pit, or even to start your night off with, good for drinks & apps",2

This place may be the best steak that I had ever tasted.  I ordered the ribeye which was very tender and seasoned to perfection. They did not overbutter their steaks like some other nice steakhouses.  

Also, they give you fries as instead of bread.  The fries are seasoned differently with various different dipping sauces.  I dont know if they do this anymore, but they did do this when I was here last.

The driver promptly came back with a ""Transaction Voided"" receipt and I was told that the amount would be credited to my account within 2-3 business days.

9696,2,1548806400000,"This was by far in a way the worst experience I've ever had at a dentist. I'll start with the most important point I have to make: Be cautious if you are considering going here for any type of dental service.I found this place through my dental insurer's app. BIG MISTAKE! Read the reviews before you go (I really wish I had)!  I would give zero stars if allowed to do so. Also, beware of what they are charging to your insurance company! The whole experience and aftermath of my appointment here felt very shady, and left me questioning whether or not I should pursue further complaints with the Better Business Bureau and my attorney.

Now for the specifics of my experience:

-When I first arrived and provided my insurance information, I was told that I needed to pay money upfront since it was unclear what my insurance would pay for. They literally requested payment from me before I had received any type of treatment or service at all. I refused, to which they responded that they could only offer me limited services moving forward.
-The staff is extremely pushy. Everyone from the dental assistant(s) to the receptionist, to the dentist himself were trying to up-sell me on different products, services, and cosmetic work that I didn't want or need. I tried several times to politely decline, but they were extremely persistent. Once I made it clear that I came in for only a cleaning and wasn't going to pay $1400+, their attitude toward me became very cold and unwelcoming.
-After sitting in the chair for over 4 hours (to get my teeth cleaned), they proceeded to tell me I needed a deep cleaning. This was of course more expensive, but I agreed. A numbing gel was rubbed onto my gums, but just as this person was about to begin, she told me she needed to work on another person and required more time to complete my cleaning on another day - AFTER I HAD ALREADY BEEN NUMBED, AND HAD BEEN SITTING IN THE CHAIR THROUGH HOURS OF UNWANTED SOLICITATION AND SALES PITCHES! I was furious and believe they only did this because I refused to pay the $1400+ they recommended. Nonetheless, I was just glad to be getting out of there. I went to the counter to set up my next appointment (which I planned to cancel as soon as I left), and they had the audacity to charge me $27.30 in fees for the cleaning that was never completed! I reluctantly paid after arguing with the receptionist. She assured me when I did come back, that fee would already be taken care of and I wouldn't have to pay it again (but I already knew I wasn't coming back here EVER). But I bit my tongue, and paid so that I could simply leave.
-A few days after my appointment, I got a statement from my insurance company that they had been billed the full price of a debridement (which is a deep cleaning). This is the service I was numbed for, and then I was told to come back another day. I protested this charge with my insurance and opened a claim against them. Hi-Tech was quick to contact me after the insurance company sent them a notice of my claim. They tried to apologize, telling me it was an error, and offered me a credit of $500 for any services I wanted over the next ~4months. They also refunded me the fee of $27.30 I paid on my visit (rightfully so). I honestly believe they only reached out and apologized in this way because they were caught in a blatant attempt at INSURANCE FRAUD!
-When I did go back several months later to ask for my dental records, x-rays, and all other logs from my visit, they couldn't give them to me that day. They said they would email them to me by 4pm the following day; several weeks later, after I continued to call, I finally was able to get someone there to send me my records via email.
-I was very puzzled why they would have so many sugary snacks offered for free to waiting customers. These will be among the first things you'd see if you walked in.
-There was at least one expired license for usage of the x-ray machinery hanging on the wall of the room I was in. I pointed this out and asked the dental assistant about it. She brushed it off, but I heard her ask about it when she left the room and whoever she spoke to simply told her to tape another piece of paper over it. Hopefully that's been corrected by now.",1

9719,1,1547596800000,"Alright, here comes a big one 
I have been to Arizonas many times. Mainly because it's close to home, plays the hockey games or UFC fights on big enough screens, and has good food 
This is a two part review

Good things:
The food at Arizonas is always tasty and the menu is HUGE so there's surely something for everyone. I recommend the pizzas, the half price apps, or the wings. 
The atmosphere during a game is great cause a lot of people are there to watch so it has a sports-bar excitement about it
There are a lot of TVs, you will see no matter where you sit 

Bad things:
Service is never great. I feel like they hire pretty girls who don't really feel they have to work at their best to serve customers. I've found most people seem annoyed or unfriendly when asked things and seem preoccupied and like they don't have the time for you
The service while they're busy is even worse- this time even effecting food prep (we came on a busy night once and my bruschetta (picture posted) was SOOO skimpy and not worth the money) 
The sound boxes that you can ask for at your table so you can hear the game/fight on tv sometimes don't play the right channel and no one seems to care to help no matter how much you ask
The atmosphere on weekend NIGHTS turns dark and loud with beats blaring- almost like a club- which is very annoying on a night where the place ADVERTISED they were playing the UFC fight (I'm just saying) 

Aoo I mean, good food, I go a lot, but sometimes it's really shit. Service is the biggest problem id say. And volume of the music when half the people in the place aren't there for that- they're there to watch a sporting event",2

9731,2,1547856000000,"Let's start off with their name, ""El Cafetal"" which means ""Coffee Plantation"". You'd think with a name like that they'd have a REAL coffee machine to make Café con Leche, Cafesito, Expresso which are available in EVERY Colombian bakery/restaurant, except this one. They have drip coffee which is blasphemous for a latin bakery/ restaurant! 

 Moving on to the complimentary platanitos (plantain chips)  which is also unusual for a Colombian restaurant as they would typically serve warm bread w/butter, except this restaurant. 

As we placed our order I asked for frijoles rojos (red beans) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I then asked for lentejas(lentils) which EVERY Colombian restaurant has, except this one. I even asked the server if they were sure they're a Colombian restaurant. 

 My Carne Asada Steak was extremely thin and lacking flavor, the rice was up to standard and the ONLY beans they offered were Pinto Beans which are typically available in Peruvian restaurants. 

The Churrasco (Sirloin Steak) wasn't bad and actually had some seasoning. The maduros were ripe and good, but you cannot be a REAL Colombian restaurant and not have RED BEANS or LENTILS! 

They are definitely not AUTHENTIC COLOMBIANS!",2
9737,2,1548720000000,"So after a couple of previous attempts we finally made it to the new Bomba Tacos and Rum in Fairlawn.  It's a mixed Mexican-Carribean type menu and some of the options looked interesting. For appetizers we ordered bacon wrapped jalapeño peppers and ceviche. They were good, I've had better but they were still quite tasty.  The ceviche was light with just the right amount of lime. It was served with red onion, avocado and fried plantain.  The flavor was light and not fishy but unfortunately the avocado was not edible as it was unripe and hard as a rock. It really should not have even be served.  We told our waitress and the chef took it off our bill. I really would have liked for them to have told us the avocado was not ripe so we could have ordered something else. Avocado is a huge part of ceviche so not having it edible was a big miss.  We each ordered two tacos as our main.  We ordered the duck, beef, pork and crispy shrimp.  The duck was such a small slice that we had to look for it in the heap shredded cabbage.  The beef and pork had a bit more in them but tacos need a lot of meat and sauce.  All of the tacos had heaps of greens and barely any of the sauce they described on the menu.  All were very dry.  The crispy shrimp was not crispy at all.  All in all a fairly big fail on all the tacos and at $3 to $4 each I think they should have been much better.  I was rooting for this place, nice decor, good service, nice atmosphere but the quality and taste was just not there.  I hope they make it.",2
9738,2,1548201600000,"Came for a late lunch after a day of travel. The customer service that we experienced from the front door to the server was phenomenal; you can tell it is clearly part of the culture and expectation of the restaurant. The server did a great job explaining the menu and suggesting some popular choices and personal favorites. Her suggestions were on point. The pretzels and provolone fondue was an excellent appetizer, the pretzels are made fresh and on site daily. By far the best I have ever tasted. The sweet potato tortellini was the servers personal suggestion and it was the absolute best pasta I have ever had; unique and different taste but absolutely on point.

9747,3,1548374400000,"This was (and will probably still be) my goto bar in Vegas because I love country, am country, and love dancing without it being a sweaty glitzy expensive Vegas scene. However, they started charging more and more cover- 10 bucks is ridiculous for a mediocre Vegas bar. The band was also meh- not necessarily danceable country (who hollers ""any George Straight fans!!"" Then plays ""the Chair""?!? Wtf?) and overly pleased with themselves- if people didn't immediately cheer after a song they would remind us (um, you're a bar band here for my dancing enjoyment, I didn't come to your concert nameless egotistical dude)... Beer selection was ok and the price was fine- $10 with tip for an amber ale draft. But I hated to order much after the stupid cover charge.

You would make a big mistake to go to this restaurant and not order that.  Very unique dish, tasty, and just overall enjoyable.  For our main course, I had their Pork Shank and it was terrific.  Huge portion with very tender pork off the bone, with a nice bark type crust yet so tender.  My friend had their stuffed Pork Chop and raved about it and the two wives split 3 small plates--1 was a small version of their mushroom dish, another was scallops with a beet risotto (they liked this one the best), and the third was a sliced BBQ Pork with a picked slaw--nice mixture of sweet and smoky.  They really liked all 3 dishes.  For dessert the 4 of us split a dessert called cereal killer which was ice cream with frosted flakes brittle, caramel sauce, and an oatmeal cookie.  Very good and plenty for the 4 of us.  Our waitress--Patricia was outstanding.  She was very knowledgeable about the menu and about the wine and seemed genuinely interested in our well being.  She is a top notch waitress.  We will be back again next year when we come back for spring training.",2

9781,2,1547856000000,"This was our 1st time to an Oregano's restaurant.  If you go at dinner time expect at least a 45 to 60 minute wait. However there is seating outside for the wait to get in and they call your name when the table is ready. We waited almost an hour on a Tuesday.

There are 3 different kinds of pizza crust, deep dish, pan and thin, I wanted to get the pan or deep dish, but the hubby always wants thin crust. And boy of boy, this thin crust is super thin, thinner than a tortilla, so being that way of course the toppings are few. 
As for taste wise and portions it was very good, and large.

Now the best things here are the salads!! Superb!!  We shared with friends 2 kinds, the Oregano's salad which had pine nuts, roasted red peppers, raisins, onions and more with an Italian dressing, Awesome, I couldn't stop eating it.  The other salad was a funny name that I cannot remember, but it had grilled chicken, tortilla strips, corn, black beans and an awesome dressing, it was the bomb!

And last, you MUST get the warm cookie topped with Ice Cream, holy moly 2 of us shared this and I could have eaten 1 all to myself. We had the Macadamia Nut, totally out of this world, warm gooey and wonderful! I know Chocolate Chip is also a choice.

The service was great, the hostess kept you informed on how long you would be waiting and how many more were in front of you.
The server was one of the best, very on top of everything and very informative, (he was also really cute), he kept our drinks full and cleared our empty dishes right away, and then boxed up our leftovers for us.

From the Bacon Wrapped Enoki to the Halibut Sea Urchin Carpaccio, all the flavor from the chef's ingredients worked so well together.  Did I mention that the chef is actually Japanese?  One of my favorite dish was the Pork Belly Yakitori skewer.  OMG! The smoky flavor coming from the meat was so unique.  Our waiter later told us that they actually import the special charcoal directly from Japan!  Definitely worth making plans for on our next Vegas trip.",1
9808,2,1548115200000,"Carino always seems to pop up in conversation now and then with a lot of interest but never a lot of knowledge from the people who seem to bring it up... ""Have you tried Carino? No? Me neither..."" Well, it was time for me to change all that! But after going once for brunch, I'm still a little confused by it. I very much enjoyed it but I'm still a little confused.

Gabi M. and I were the first ones into the restaurant for Sunday brunch starting at 10:00AM. Right in the middle of Edmonton trail, across the street from a packed Diner Deluxe and an OEB that seemed to have more people waiting to get in than in the restaurant itself, it was odd to find a brunch spot with no line. (She'd even tell you the same thing, right here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/carino-japanese-bistro-wine-calgary?hrid=nRSp-f0hmXDox5Q3C0wPuA)

They serve a special brunch menu that is Japanese infused with North American style brunch. I had the Loco Moco, which is a bowl of Terayaki rice with a Wagyu beef burger patty on top and then a sunny-side egg on top of that. Gabi's review is spot on - I did quite enjoy it! My egg was cooked well, the burger remained tender and juicy, the rice was good and sticky to hold a well proportioned amount of Teriyaki. The food is very well made and attractively displayed. SO why is it that all the other brunch places along Edmonton Trail were lined up, but not Carino? While their menu definitely incorporates a touch of North American brunch (mostly adding an egg to everything) to an asian menu, there's something about it that just doesn't quite seem quite fulfilling if you had your heart set on brunch. Teriyaki rice is delicious, make no mistake about it! But adding an egg on top doesn't necessarily satisfy the brunch pangs the way I hoped it would.

I'm interested in going back to Carino and trying their evening service. A Japanese Italian mix is something I feel like I can get behind for any other meal of the day.

The space looks like it's set up more for evening service than it is for brunch. Classy black chandeliers, (laminate) hard wood floors, and side booth seating give it a lounge/wine bar feel.

The service is friendly, the space is nice and the food is good. I feel like Carino is a solid bet if you're feeling adventurous for brunch and desire North American inspire Japanese dishes, and not the other way around.",2

Before deciding to buy from M-N-M, I shopped locally here in California and online for about a month.  I found many online used and new deals but was nervous about buying a guitar that I couldn't see and touch in person before buying. Once I decided to buy brand new guitar I figured I would buy from a dealer who was responsive to my questions about the guitar I was looking for, competitive in price and provided me a comfort level I needed in order to purchase a guitar I haven't seen or played in person.  I started working with the Greg Thompson from Music N More in Concord, North Carolina.  He was very responsive to my numerous emails and understood my need for feeling comfortable in purchase a guitar online and sight on seen.  After we narrowed down the brand and model he offered the best price I could find for the guitar.  After exchanging emails and having phone conversations I knew I was ready to pull the trigger and buy from Greg and M-N-M.  I have since received my new Taylor and couldn't be happier.  The Taylor arrived in perfect condition and it sounds great.  I expect many years of enjoyment learning and playing this guitar.  And plan on purchasing my future music instruments and accessories from M-N-M.  Thanks again Greg for making my purchase an easy one and looking forward to future business with Music N More.

The lady who did my nails removed the shellac properly and tried to prevent damage to my nails. She also did a really great job applying the colour, which she helped me choose (this colour is now my go-to).

The service was friendly enough and the quality of food was average, as most Asian places are (dont hate me for that one)... You know as you get older and more cynical and you become a better chef yourself your standards get higher - and why shouldnt they??  I could make better than this blindfolded.

9951,2,1547683200000,"I concur with the reviews regarding customer service and training. 

My friend and I walked in and asked the hostess if they had soup, she nodded yes and then I asked her what kind. She showed us the menu and we decided on the Clam Chowder, we told her we wanted calm chowder, she then asked where we would like to sit and we told her the bar. 

Couple mins later bar tender (super nice guy) showed up and asked us if we wanted anything and we told him no, we already had drinks and had placed our order.

10mins later I asked if they had a bread basket for people waiting on food..... the hostess went and got the manager who in a very condescending tone asked if we had food coming...we told her yes we had placed an order for soup 


Another 10-15mins pass and she brings us the bread basket and informed us they were still making the soup...  another 10 mins pass and she asks the bartenders if we ordered soup through them, they both responded no. She then comes and tells us that there is no order for our soup and the hostess never put in the order.....


At this point I am pissed, my friend was hungry she had an extraction and could only drink soup... and I State that to the waitress who asked us if everything is okay. She ran back to the kitchen and reappeared with 2mins with the soup and bread...

And while the bartender was awesome he did charge my card for my friends soup and walked up with the receipt...my friend had cash in hand to pay him...


Bunch of errors, bunch of misunderstanding, the manager is super rude and condescending. Just awful experience. 


Food was great, but I didn't order the soup and was charged for something I didn't personally place.",2

True there is no smoking, no gambling, and no restaurants for Elara, but Jesus, it's right next to the Planet Hollywood. In fact, Elara is in the same building as the Planet Hollywood. To get to the actual hotel, you HAVE to go inside Planet Hollywood which has the The Miracle Mile Shops, restaurants and a casino(The Pleasure Pit)! There is a parking Garage right next to the Lobby of Elara, so no, you do not have to carry your luggage through out The Miracle Mile Shops. You just self park on the third floor of the Planet Hollywood parking garage and, boom! The entrance to the lobby is right there! & if you're taking a taxi from the airport, even better because you won't have to look for parking! 

We checked in Thursday June 21st and checked out Sunday June 24th and our stay was wonderful! We had no problems at all checking in or out at the front desk. However, to get to the room, you need to show your room key to the security at the front of the room elevators or you can't get in(Only one person in the group has to show the key). They are very strict with this so always have your room key with you! They won't allow you to bring your friends unless you go get them and show the security guard your room key!

The price for our room was AMAZING! We were planning to book a one bedroom suite for 400$ but our friend wanted to have her own room so we booked a two bedroom suite for $1,200. Our room was on the 23rd floor and it was huge not to mention our view was amazing! We had floor to ceiling windows in the living room and the two other rooms! The kitchen was fully stocked, had a huge fridge that had water and ice, a microwave/conventional over, a dish washer, a huge sink and a stove. My friend's room had a huge red leather couch that was also a queen pull out bed, a king size bed with a padded black leather head board and the bathroom had a separate shower, his and her sink and toilet. The main Bedroom had a jacuzzi right next to the bed with mirrors everywhere! We had a desk and a zebra print lounge chair and had the same king size bed as the other room. Our bathroom was just the same as our friends room only it had another door for the living room. The living room had a wrap around leather couch that also doubled as a queen size pull out bed and the blinds for the window also doubled as a screen because we also had a projector! Did I mention that every single room had a flat screen TV that welcomed the person who booked the room? There was another TV in the living room, a TV in each bedroom room, a TV in the bathroom and even a TV in the kitchen! This place was AMAZING for the price we paid for the weekend of the start of summer! 

The noise wasn't a bother either. There was one point where I thought our neighbors were too loud, but I found out it was the TV in my friends room. I had no problems here!

You can't go wrong with Elara, it's not only at the center of the strip, but it's right inside Planet Hollywood and you can shop, eat, drink( there is a Fat Tuesday inside the mall). and gamble! The only thing is, you can't go inside the same pool as Planet Hollywood, but Elara does have it's own pool too!

Love this place!!! Great price, great stay, great sleep!

My BF got the mahi mahi , it was overcooked and dry.  Our chocolate dessert just tasted burnt.   The beer was so-so.

10024,2,1547596800000,"Here's the short version: Worst possible dining experience, no exaggeration. Wrong reservation, terrible service, bad food, and promises broken for a business dinner with our best client.

Here's the long version: Came here for a business dinner for our most important client on a recommendation. We made our reservation for their private dining area 2 months in advance to coincide with a trade show. Confirmed our reservation a week or two in advance as well. 

I checked in with the hostess with about half of our 20+ party there. They said our table would be ready soon and to let them know when our entire party was there. Our entire party arrived about 5 minutes later and I informed them that all were present and she said our table would be ready in a few minutes. After another 5 minutes I check to see if our table was ready. Said it would be soon, just a few minutes. After another 5 minutes I asked about our table and again the answer was soon. Not a good thing to keep a large group and important clients waiting 15 minutes for a private room that was supposed to be reserved. 

Finally we were told our tables were ready but it was just that, normal tables in their regular dining area. We informed them that their must be a mistake since we specifically reserved their private dining room. We were given some attitude and told that we were mistaken but they would look into it. They quickly learned from their group reservation department that their was some sort of lack or mix-up of communication between them and the hostess. The general manager shows up and began to sweat and apologize to us a thousand times. 

Nothing could be done at the time because they had already given away tables in their private dining area. There was only an approximate estimate of an hour wait to move to that area. We decided to start at the tables we had and move if the private area became available soon. 

Fortunately they said they would be able to move us to the private area after 20 minutes so we headed over. Unfortunately it was not a private room but just a semi-private area partially enclosed by glass walls. And there were still some other diners in the area but we were assured the tables would remain empty once they finished. 

After all of this drama I thought to myself ""hopefully the food is AMAZING and redeems this entire mess."" However, I was thoroughly disappointed. The blue crab chowder was too salty, the prime rib was mediocre at best (I'd rather have Bellagio buffet prime rib), and the desserts were forgetful. 

In addition, the service was pretty poor. A number of us had finished our drinks and had empty glasses on our table. They remained empty on our table for at least 20-30 minutes. When I had my water refilled I asked them to take away my other empty glass. It was taken away but all of the other empty glasses were ignored. It was bizarre to me that this simple task was overlooked, especially after the general manager said that he would make sure that we were taken care of and serviced well. He also mentioned that he would give us additional drinks and food and not charge us. After we received the final bill that didn't seem to be the case and it looked like we were charged the full amount. 

What added insult to this all was that the other tables in our semi-private dining area didn't remain empty, they continued to fill them with new diners. We spent about $5000 for the worst possible dining experience on clients who do over $50 million in business with us.",3

On the HH menu they have ramen for 5 bucks, never have had ramen before and not really being a person who eats soups (more of a curry, stew kind of girl) I thought eh for 5 bucks, why not try it. Well am I am glad I did!

The broth was good, and inside the ramen was roasted pork, house bacon, pickled mustard greens, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts and a soft egg, it looked soo good, picked up the chop sticks and went right at it! I popped the egg and let it get all happy in the broth, and picked up a piece of that bacon, omg the bacon is soo good. The broth to me needed something but Clever Koi makes their own sriracha sauce and added that to the broth and BAM! That did the trick!

There were 7 tables seated.  There were about 11 tables open. When I approached the hostess, she explained to me that there would be a short wait of 5-10 minutes.  I asked why and she said that they are out of menus (there were togo menus sitting on the hostess station), and that they just seated the tables that were already sitting.  She explained that they were afraid that the kitchen would get too many orders at once so instead of seating me at one of the many open tables at 11:30, she wanted me to wait 5-10 minutes.  Normally, I would not mind waiting when there is no place to sit.  But, this place just opened for lunch.  Why in the world would there not be enough people to cook food at lunch with 11 open tables?  I went back and forth with her and to her credit, she was very nice but I still could not get past the idea that I am being asked to wait while there are 11 open tables because the lunchers are wanting to eat.  Why are there not enough cooks for this place?  Was lunch a surprise today?  When you ask people to wait to be seated at a half empty restaurant because you don't want to put too much stress on the cooks to cook the food, you are asking us to take part in managing your staff.  I want to come to your restaurant to eat.  I don't want to have to call ahead first and find out if there are enough cooks for the number of seats you have.  I don't get paid to run that place.

I will defiantly be back here with him to try other menu items! I made reservations at 9 on a Saturday, and there was barely anyone in the dining area so I don't feel the need to do that again.",2

10147,1,1547251200000,"Who knew such amazing food could come from a kitchen at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport? I certainly didn't.

So my flight was supposed to leave back to Vegas at 6pm. Then the text came in that my flight was delayed to 9pm. Game Over. My battleship had been sunk. I was stuck. What else do you do when you have 3+ hours to kill at an airport? Eat dinner of course!

I really liked how Sky Harbor has a ton of non-chain restaurants in their main food court area. A quick glance at Yelp and Chelsea's Kitchen with it's great dining room was an easy pick. The menu isn't huge, but definitely has enough options to appease a variety of diners. My selection on this flight-delayed evening was the short rib tacos. It was an easy decision to make once our dynamite waitress gave the suggestion saying it was what they were known for. We also decided to start off with chips & guacomole. I don't know if I was just famished or if it was that good, but the guac was absolutely off the charts good. My tacos were equally as tasty. The short rib was super tender, great flavor, and the homemade corn tortillas made this a 5 star meal. I wasn't crazy about the kale slaw that accompanied it, but I'm also not a big fan of kale. The person I was traveling with landed on the Green Chili burger and it looked really, really good. He housed that, I housed mine, and we were able to kill a good 90 minutes in the restaurant.

The service was incredible, the ambiance was very nice (especially for an airport), and most importantly the food was great. Next time it won't be a mandated delay, I'll get to the airport early enough to partake in another Chelsea's Kitchen meal.",2

Among the five different tacos we ordered, the octopus taco was the best in my opinion. The other ones were all a little bit on the salty side. Duck confit taco has a surprisingly taste. If you know Peking duck - it's very similar to that!

10156,2,1547683200000,"Tsujiri is a 155 year old shop, originally from Kyoto, Japan (aka land of Matcha).

I was super excited to hear that this beloved Japanese tea shop opened up in Toronto, and it was super close to me.  Being a Matcha lover, I jumped at trying them out.

Firstly, the shop - despite the narrow space, the shop feels airy and light.  I loved all the wooden touches throughout the store as it brought me back to my time in Kyoto.

The Drinks & Desserts

The shops been open for just over a year, and till recently has only served drinks and desserts.  The drink menu ranges from traditional green teas like Sencha and Matcha (both hot and cold) to fancy Starbucks like drinks such as Black Sesame Matcha Latte (my fav), and O-Matcha Cappuccino.  For those that are more adventurous, try out the ones made with Kinako (roasted soy beans). OH! And may I suggest an Ice Yuzu Citron Float on a hot summer day?  The ice blended drink, infused with a hint of Japanese grapfruit, topped off with some green tea soft serve will for sure cool you right  off 

The shop also offers a variety of desserts for you to nibble on.  The ice cream sundaes are filled with a variety of yummy goodies (think green tea chiffon cake, red beans, mochi, and of course green tea soft serve). Other desserts include green tea cream puffs, lemon tarts, and of course, different flavored mochi's. 

The North York location now also serves food! It's the first non Japanese Tsujiri to do so! I know I should put up photos of their yummy green tea soba and such, but really, I needed to show you the wiggly, jiggly matcha pancakes that they also now serve! It's a must try.",2

I don't like heavy seasoning and oils so this is a pizza place that doesn't make you want to roll over and die after. They always take an hour to deliver no matter what time I call. Worth the hour wait especially for the price. Only negative thing I have to say is usually the girl who answers the phone isn't very friendly and sometimes acts like it's an inconvenience to her...only reason I didn't give them a five star,3

The lady in desk name Annie claimed that we should be in the airport 2 hours prior to our flight with bad attitude and no mercy whatsoever. We actually did but after dropping off the car rental and freaking long lines with only 2 TSA checking tickets and Id you probably need 3 hours. We are total of five passengers with two kids one is 3 years old and one is 9 months old. We checked in already but they claimed the plane never been late. Oh well no wonder it's because they left early. I spoke to supervisor Brad and he claimed that they closed the door 10 minutes before the original flight. They should have put 6:30 pm flight instead of 6:40pm. What the heck they are in Vegas at least can they be considerate and wait 5 it 10 minutes at least? They claimed they page our names but we didn't hear it. Only 2 TSA with a long lines and the machine to check the babies bag doesn't work so we have to wait little bit more. My experienced with Virgin America was very lousy. They weren't helpful at all. We rented a car and I have to rent paid plenty for that plus car seats for two of my child and left midnight for 12 hours drive. If the plane is delayed we as passengers no choice but if your late you pay for the consequences. I will never fly Virginia America again. Looking forward to get at least my money back.

Eating at airport sports bars.

All Stars is one of those small airport sports bars where folks go because they have no other options.  The service is meh (although, I must say the woman tending the bar was quite quick and capable, and even a bit friendly), they're out of most of the things they ""offer"" and the food. . . well.  Ballpark food is better.  Why I thought this would be a better option than Round Table I'm not sure.  I had a bratwurst and everything on the plate but the pickle, maybe the bun, was clearly frozen.  The brat itself was that awful white color that screams, ""I came preboiled!  Won't I be delicious?!"", the veggies were the watery, tasteless, came in a mix and were left out to thaw variety, and the fries were room temperature seasoned fries.  The pickle was sad and flaccid, and the bun was, well, it was just a bun.
Yeah, it was food, yeah I ate it, but WHY?  Gross.
Furthermore, either this article (http://living.health.com/2008/11/24/americas-healthiest-airports/2/) is a crock, or it's another terminal of the airport because I saw nary a ""healthful dining option"" anywhere in the area.",2

The staff at Buca was exceptional in dealing with her allergy. When we told our waiter, he asked questions to fully understand the issue and made sure everyone serving us was aware. They also could make ANY dish gluten free. I've never seen my friend happier or more attention paid to her allergy. She thoroughly enjoyed her rabbit ragu, and my mushroom gnocchi was delicious.

And service is always so high, everybody who works there is super polite and respectful. It is also has cafe vibes to it so you can come for coffee or tea and just relax.

I've been here a few times starting in 2012 and it has been consistently great ever since. I've had a variety of pasta lunch services which can range from below $10 to just below $20 depending on the main pasta dish, but they always come with a salad and soup of the day (yes, the soups and salads were different almost every time I come here) and a piece of garlic bread with your pasta. The portions are also really filling, which I really like because it's hard to find places with really really good food that also give enough food to fill you up!

b) Shawarma the meat is fresh/roasted spit/ and not the processed mystery meat that some places serve.
c) the Lentil soup is home made and delish
d) potatoes mediocre and pricy.

It's a little pricier than your usual spot that sells the same grub - but the food is fresh and it is a family run place and NOT a chain establishment with mystery meat and greasy pre-made dried regurgitated Felafel balls (so this could be an indicator of why it is a little pricier than other places).",2

I have to say my bar was set pretty high by salons in Toronto and New York but upon reassurance from Yelp, I booked my appointment, got my nails done and was super thrilled! Like, I almost ""hugged all the nail technicians at the salon"" kinda thrilled!

Exquisite Nails has the friendliest staff-- they're attentive, welcoming and knowledgeable about the trends. I came prepared with photos, diagrams and samples and I didn't even have to break them out-- they knew exactly what I was talking about and were a step ahead of me: offering designs or gem work without any additional costs. This is almost unheard of in the nail-world!  

Tracey and Natalie did mine and my sister's nails. Tracey is the sweetest. She talked to me throughout my entire salon and greeted many clients by their first name. A signal to me, that people like their honest and amazing service. Speaking of honesty, when I booked my appointment over the phone, I was told that it was $55 for a new set (solar or regular acrylic) with two nail designs (as long as it wasn't too complicated) and guess what?

After she prepared the wings which was lemon pepper and buffalo hot she showed them to me and seem very excited to serve the food. I immediately noticed the fries were dark brown and discolored probably from being cooked in old oil but I didn't have the heart to say can I have a refund, i just said mmm thats good lol. The wings barely had any seasoning on them at all it looked like there was a couple drops of hot sauce on each wing for the buffalo hot and the lemon pepper was pretty sparsely season as well. I I bit into a couple of the Wings and they were still dark red and bloody on several of them so I threw it in the trash. I'm just going to chalk up the money as donating to this lady as I really wanted this place to be good but I think there are more than one thing broken here, i.e. sanitation, burnt oil, and not putting sauce on wings.Avoid this just go to Buffalo Wild Wings or make the trip to Wingstop.

Regarding the food, I have absolutely no complaints. As usual, I got my standard order of tempura and red dragon roll as a meter stick for any new sushi restaurant, and this place was appreciably above average. The tempura was battered nicely and quite light - there's nothing worse than broccoli caked with oily half cooked batter. The roll was excellent as well, with an excellent filling to rice ratio, packed full of avocado and tempura shrimp that was still crunchy.

How can I not score this place when my Man specifically made reservations to take me here for my birthday dinner number 2? When re-reading my review...I think the 4 stars were based on my experience with the FOOD here...

The ambience was very nice, casual, people came in flipflops and shorts...which is not what I had expected...sorta romantic...except for how we were 6 inches away on each side from the other couples...they were packing us in like sardines....ugh...AND the noise level was pretty LOUD. I had imagined this place to be a little more romantic and moody...but it was not...

The service was good...it was interesting that the menus were printed on paper which they took from you, so you can't even keep it as a souvenir...what we didn't appreciate was the server practically forcing us to order something as an appetizer or ""1st course"" as we would be waiting for our meals for a long while because there were people ahead of us...the bf said...No thanks we're not interested...but he repeated again several times like we were STUPID highly suggesting we get something...this put the BF in a bad mood because the server was 2nd guessing what we should be getting and not leaving us alone! I mean they give you a bowl of pistachios and bread! WHY did we have to feel pressured into ordering a salad? Which by the way did have the best goat cheese EVER..it was like BUTTERY soft and smooth...and we only waited like 15 minutes before our meals came out! WTH? 

So anyways...we both tried the specials for the evening, I had the top sirloin, he had the halibut...both were excellent! We also ordered the pomme frittes (fries) and they were just alright and too much for 2 people to eat...Also had 2 glasses of wine which paired very nicely with our meals...The 1 good suggestion we appreciated from the server...

ALL in ALL it was a very EXPENSIVE meal and we truly had way better service and food at Napa Rose for the same price...at least that's in my opinion....

I truly hope French Laundry is BETTER than this place, because I can't believe the previous review saying that they enjoyed this place even more...that's not saying much about French Laundry then...keeping fingers crossed...Overall it was a classy place...MINUS the loud and irritating stamp machine they have in the front that embosses their name and phone number one a blue square card...LAMENESS...",2

I even took a chance to look at Yelp to see what some of these inventions were.  We ended up ordering the spicy scrambled eggs and the sweet potato hash.  Both were really good and we enjoyed our meals. Would recommend.,3

I ordered zaru soba as my filler dish which wasn't too bad though it was zaru soba so you can't really screw that one up too hard.

I ordered takoyaki.  I know this isn't Japan, and I am pretty sure Japan has better, but this is one of the better takoyakis I had in North America.

I also ordered seared tuna on ponzu sauce (I think).  The dish was good, but it was pale in comparison to the honey plum tuna I had at Winnipeg.

We also got some other dishes: thanks N for remembering for me

Osaka Fried Rice (I don't think I got to try it)
a bowl of Udon (I don't think I got to try it)
Chicken Skin Skewer (um, not my thing)
Shrimp Mayo (yummy, oh so yummy)
Grilled Sablefish (good, but I think I prefer fish raw)

10371,3,1548374400000,"I'll make this to the point

the bad:
1. There are much better restaurants in this price range, SW being one.
2. The food is overpriced for what you get.
3. Don't sit on the couches on the wall, they're way over used. The table was at my chest and had to ask to be moved.
4. The busser did the server's job, besides take orders.
5. The server didn't introduce herself nor welcome us to the restaurant (not being picky, but many patrons expect this when you're paying $130 per person.)
6. The hostess had to take our dessert order because the waitress was nowhere to be found, which is extremely irritating.
7. I had to send back the scotch I wanted because they gave it to me with cocktail ice. This is completely unacceptable for a $22 scotch.

The good:
1. The decor was very nice and not too bright or dark.
2. They give out free appetizers, french fries, which are pretty good.
3. The hostesses are very accommodating.
4. Decent beers and excellent wines.",2

I ordered a wrap, which was good and it came with a side.  I asked the waitress if soup was a side, she said yes, not mentioning that somewhere in the menu it said that soup as a side was an up charge. I confirmed with her what soup was a side.  2 other's ordered  soup as an extra.  All soup came lukewarm but I didn't send mine back as it was French onion. Just decided to go with it.  When we got our bill, there was an ad on for my soup. Mentioned it to waitress who now informed me of the extra cost.  I said no that I had asked about sides.  I have always been told that there was an extra cost.  She send over a guy and asked me what I wanted him to do about it. I explained. His response was I'll take it out of her pay (guilt trip?).

Needless to say we will be returning.",2
10433,2,1548633600000,"Well, i went there with a bunch of friends during out Thanksgiving break. I have to say i am quite disappointed with the overall experience. First of, the food took forever to come. It was a Friday night, but the restaurant was no where being full. We had a relatively big party(11 of us) but it's not like they were waiting for all of the food to be prepared in order to serve us. The foods arrived at different time with 10 minutes of gap in between. I am not sure how it could possibily take so long to prepare dishes like Steak and Frites. Afterall, it's just a Brasserie not some a tradtional French Cuisine. I ordered a special, which is a Braised Veal's Shoulder which was nothing like what the waiter has described. And i quote "" it's crispy on the outside and tender in the inside"". The meat is relatively dry and hard to chew. The rest of the party ordered Steak and Frites which is again mediocre for a French restaurant.  Lastly, it's pretty pricy considered that the food was nothing special. If you decide to go, just don't hold too much expectations as i did, or you will be disappointed.",2
10437,1,1547510400000,"My Husband and I came last night for dinner to celebrate our 6th wedding anniversary. We planned this evening out right after Christmas when we received several gift cards from family. 

   The place was pretty busy, but we decided to stay. We were seated promptly which was very nice. We were told that someone would be with us shortly as usual. After 10 minutes and 2 birthday celebrations we were both shocked to find that no one was tending to us. We decided to just wait and see if someone would be coming to our table then. Seems we were seated at a bust time maybe? After 22 minutes I got up and went to the gal that seated us. I let her know that we had been sitting there the whole time with no one to tend to us. Immediately the manager turned around and apologized. Promised to make our evening very nice. As we walked to the table I noticed a server talking to my Husband. We agreed to stay and attempt to enjoy our visit. 

  I know things happen and you can't take it personally. We didn't. I'm glad we stayed because our server and the manager took really good care of us. Our server was very friendly and made us feel better. We respected her and gave her a fair opportunity. We had the calamari for an appetizer. It was brought to our table immediately. It was hot and fresh. The 2 sauces were delicious. We will order it again!

   I had the skinny chicken pasta and Hubby had the chicken di pana. Both dishes were very tasty. We both enjoyed our dishes, but wish we had switched plates at some point. We decided to share a piece of Kahlua cheesecake and take a piece of the lemon meringue cheesecake home. Great idea! 

   Even though our evening started out rough, the service and food was worth it all. Our server and the manager definitely made our evening very enjoyable and fun. We are very thankful for the experience and are planning to return soon. Thank you to everyone for another great experience!",3

This chocolatier gets more creative every time I see their wrapped bars on display!  I was so pleasantly surprised when I saw their store at the Forum Shops in Caesar's Palace.  There was an array of uses for their chocolate creations: chocolate cookie mix, bon bons, and caramel barks.  Just LOVELY!  The combinations of flavors they had thought up too....amusing and clever!

10437,3,1548633600000,"If you're looking for that classic steak house experience--the one grandma and grandpa had each and every anniversary--then look no further.  More than just kitsch though, Wellington's delivers on their particular area of expertise: steak.  It's a place where the servers are still largely male, fitted into vests, and adorned with bowties (of the clip-on variety, I say with a sniff).  The steak chef is on display in a flame-fueled fishbowl of sorts (on our night, the grill chef looked like he was straight out of the pages of a Dickens novel), which really adds character to the dated dining room.
If you go (and I suggest you do) two or more of you MUST order the freshly prepared Caesar salad.  Prepared by your server tableside, the dressing is started with anchovies and garlic, oil, egg yolk, dijon mustard, pepper, and liberally whipping with a fork.  You haven't had Caesar salad until you've had it done fresh before your eyes--and don't let the anchovies freak you out!  In fact, check the label of your favourite Caesar dressing; they're likely hiding in there already.
While our first trip to Wellington's was for a special occasion (my mother-in-law was visiting) I would go here just for a night out.  If you like, join in singing Happy Birthday to Aunt Ethel, celebrating her Ninetieth, or wait with baited breath for someone to propose--chances are, both will happen during the course of dinner.

I say sublime because the level of good taste and sophistication that oozzes from the joint is beyond most people's comprehension.  From the fragrant lobby to the Le Crueset tea kettle in the kitchen no detail is spared.  And it has just the right amount of bling to remind you that are in a Trump hotel and secondly that you are in Sin City.

The staff is exceptionally well trained and again, top shelf. With a level of customer service unsurpassed by Bellagio, Wynn or Palazzo and it shines a bright ligth on how bad customer service is in LA.  They kissed our butts, in a good way though, it was very sincere and friendly.  They made us feel like, well, Donald Trump himself without going over board.  It all just seemed very intimate and natural.

I will say that the gal at the desk in the spa didn't seem to be cut from the same cloth but why are spa desk girls so snotty anyway.? Because she didn't even seem to try to make me feel welcomed, I cancelled my appointment.

We didn't get to try DJT, the house restaurant because it was closed on Monday.  

I recommend the suite, just below the penthouse, on the 45th floor.  It's on the corner and you get breathtaking views of the strip from the living room, the bedroom and the spa-tub.

Ambiance is ok. Too small and tight. If there are more than 4 or 5 tables full, get ready to listen in all your neighbor's conversations.

Décor is nice. Lots of old pictures of Calgary and some interesting art. Music is eclectic but it can become a little too loud, especially if your under the speaker. The fresh flowers on the tables is nice.

As far as the food, we have only had the Dairy Lane Burgers so far and they are amazing. You can taste the difference that quality grass fed beef has. Juicy. Tender. D-Lish! They actually use organic red (not white) tomatoes which is great.

The fries however, not so great. They use Kennebec potatoes. These are supposed to be the best possible potatoes for french fries. If they are, then they don't fry them right. They are too soggy. We asked for crispier ones the next time and they were still the same, soggy.

I decided the following time not to order the fries with my burger but I was still charged for something I didn't like or want.

It pretty diverse for small buffet in comparison too hotels. They have all the standard ones kung pau chicken, fried rice, and goes on and on. Like said it hit or miss find couple of good ones. Times some maybe not going through as much so it was warm at best. The popular choices they tend not too replace them as quick as the other ones. They have mongolian bbq section pick your protein and some assorted vegetables cook it up for you. I was hunger not feel like waiting but it look good.

It just changed management so the interior is lot nicer then before. It been while came here for lunch couple of times.

I called them back and they said to come back. At this point, I was hungry and tired of driving so they said they would give me a bowl for free the next time. I called the other day to redeem and to order 5 bowls for my family and they said they could only give me the veggies and a side of rice as a replacement for the bowl. Huh?!? When I got home, the chicken and veggie bowl was more like chicken and cabbage bowl. About 98% of the ""veggies"" were cabbage with little to no broccoli or carrots. The meat was as close to jerky as can be. It was so close to being inedible. Will never go here again.",1

My wife brought me here for my birthday.  Almost all of the food was wonderful.

I had the caesar's salad, blue corn tamale, and rabbit.  My wife had a blue corn tamale and the only chicken dish on the menu.

The meal started with a basket of 3 different breads.  The jalapeño cheese bread and the date rasin bread were wonderful.  The corn muffin on the other hand was fairly bland and very dry.

The caesar's salad has warm crutons, made from hominy that had a wonderful crunchy shell around a sweet soft inside, with chorizo slices and parmasian cheese crisps.  Wonderful.

My wife and I loved the blue corn tamales.  They were served in a tied husk, had a great texture, and wonderful flavor.

The only chicken dish was too spicy for my wife.  She said the flavor was good but very spicy.

Nothing to get excited about but it's Free.  Overall an enjoyable stay for a good price $65 a night with Hotels.com",2

I will note that it is a very small store with very few employees and not a lot of merchandise. So it may be helpful if you call in advance to driving there and make sure they have what you need.

The bad:  Our server was initially very distant and not particularly friendly. However, after looking him in the eye, saying lots of ""pleases"" and ""thank yous"" and just generally engaging him, he was so much friendlier.  The only other negative is that he seemed to get lost and didn't check back with the table often.  We would've ordered another round of drinks had he come back more often. Getting the check with difficult as well.  The I also had a friend that ordered the flatbread (not sure if it was pumpkin or sweet potato, but it was along those lines) with sage...it was a good concept, but not savory enough.

Now the good:  The server lightened up and was very sweet once he got over his initial standoffishness.  The drinks were pretty decent.  I was looking for a Moscow Mule, but the server informed me that they don't have ginger beer, but ginger simple syrup.  So we kind of improvised and it was still good.  Everyone ordered a drink off of their specialty menu and enjoyed it.  Food wise -the bottomless popcorn - YUMMY!!  And they were generous with it.  As I mentioned above, my friend ordered the flatbread - consensus at the table was that it was too sweet and not savory enough.  I ordered the trout - DELISH!!! We shared a couple of the chicory salads - pretty good...the dressing was nice and light.  Others at the table ordered the mussels and the flatbread of the night and they were all very happy.

Overall, I'd give the place another whirl...particularly for drinks!",2

Had 3 massages w/my 2 best friends for our local girlfriend get away.  Room was nice, restaurants and gaming area great!  However, the spa was HORRIBLE!  The front desk girl acted like we were a burden to be waited on even when we went to pay our huge bill.  All of us make good money and are professional ladies.  We don't drink at a spa or act up-we are the guests of an establishment and we treat it as we would want a guest in our own homes.  So there was no reason for the treatment we got.  The rest of the staff was ok.  Not rude but the massages and treatments were that of a training school level-yet some of the MOST expensive we have ever paid for!  And they made the 20% tip mandatory for our party of THREE!  Which was not acceptable because the treatments were all very poor and the tip would have reflected it.  Did write a letter to the spa mgr of our treatment and poor quality massages and part of our bill was refunded, but this is not what we wanted.

10578,2,1548374400000,"I wrote a previous review on this restaurant back in Dec 2016 to chronicle an excellent date night I had with my husband here. I just had to write another review because this past Saturday, I hosted my son's 1st communion brunch here.  I chose Deagan's because it's really nice family friendly environment, the brunch menu sounded awesome and the prices were ok and that's in addition to my previous wonderful experience here.  

Setting a reservation was no problem and they allowed me to bring my son's cake.  My party and I arrived for our 11:30am reservation and were seated immediately.  Our waitress greeted us right away, took our food orders and answered questions we had about some of the dishes.  My husband and his parents were excited about the Bloody mary bar.  There is a buffet of ingredients to make your own custom drink and it was a hit!  I had the pineapple mimosa - delicious! Then the food came out... my father in law and a friend rdered the chicken fried steak and it was a sizable portion (I wish I took pictures) - well worth the cost of the dish and it was beautifully presented.  He kept raving about how good it was and how he could barely finish the plate because it was so much food!  He said, ""I'm curious to see what the dinner menu looks like if the brunch menu is this good!""

I had the PBLT (pork belly) which was delicious although it came with a runny egg when it was advertised as a fried egg, but not that big of a deal for me.  The pork belly was cooked perfectly, moist and Deagan's has the best home fries I've ever tasted - it's not what I am use to at all - the potatoes were crisp and slightly chunky unlike common home fries which are more ""shredded"" like and only crisp on the very top layer.  My husband had the lobster dish and loved it and my mother in law had the frittata and commented on how good it was.  My son had apple pancakes but didn't like the caramel sauce but our waitress was very understanding and got him another stack of pancakes.  Everyone was more than satisfied with their food and kept saying how nice the restaurant was.  It wasn't busy at all for a Saturday brunch hour.

I also want to say the service was excellent! Our waitress (I can't remember her name unfortunately with everything going on) came to check on us frequently and offered to place my son's cake in their cooler until we were ready for it.  When it was time, she brought out extra plates, forks and napkins as well as a cutting knife.  We all felt more than welcome.  I am so glad my family had a good time.

I hate planning events lol but Deagan's made it so easy (they even called me the day before to confirm the reservation details).  I would definitely host another event here.  Thank you to the staff!",2

10580,2,1547164800000,"My friend is obsessed with this place, so it was quickly nominated for girls lunch. My first impression was that it was spacious and everyone was super friendly, I mean they open the door for you and are ready with recommendations. I immediately decided on the pick 2 combo, for the price it seemed like a bargain. The Asian BBQ sandwich sounded amazing and I heard the roasted cauliflower soup was fantastic, so I ordered it up. I love that you can see all of the ingredients, everything is so fresh and colorful, it really adds to the experience. We were pushed expeditiously through the line and found a table despite it being packed. I really enjoyed the Asian BBQ sandwich, it definitely had a kick to it but it had a good fresh flavor too. I instantly fell in love with the cauliflower soup, it was so creamy and rich, mmmmmm perfection! I like that they give you a piece of bread to dip in the soup, but it was overkill with my sandwich. I loved ending my meal with a chocolate covered strawberry, such a simple touch but a great way to end any meal. 

I was so impressed that I decided to go back that weekend with my husband. This time I tried the pulled pork sandwich and of course the cauliflower soup again. The pulled pork had honey mustard and cabbage on it. I don't normally enjoy honey mustard, but I thought all of the flavors worked well together. My husband had the clam chowder and the Italian sandwich. The clam chowder had a lot of black pepper in it, which wasn't my favorite, but he enjoyed it. The Italian sandwich, on the other hand, was great and I really enjoyed their homemade balsamic dressing.

Overall, I think this is a really great lunch option. Everything is fresh and made to order. The customer service is fantastic, in fact when my husband and I were there they were giving away their daily customer service award to one of their team members - how cool! I can't wait to try some more soups and maybe even a salad next time. This is definitely a welcome addition to the Henderson scene.",2

At 7.99$ for your choice of wonton or hot and sour soup with your choice of main plate from black pepper beef to general tao chicken (generous portions), yet not too much food, the deal has me coming back time and time again. They even honour this price for take out during the lunch hour. This restaurant is also great for groups. They have several large rotating round tables that allow for groups to order several dishes to share.

We were stoked coming in.  Our server (Brian) had been highly recommended in other reviews...we were first in line so we could be in his section.  Unfortunately, he ended up being the only bright spot in our dinner and the reason that I gave 2 stars vs. 1 for the food.  Food-wise, we were extremely disappointed on every single item served.  I ordered the bone in rib eye. When it came out it looked fantastic...I ordered it medium.  it came out medium rare.  The taste was bland and was tough....really for prime beef? I also ordered the lobster tail....it was by far the worst one that I have ever had.  It was cold, very tough and had a very odd sauce on it. It is my belief that  due to being fully booked for VD that they precooked it and warmed it when ordered. I saw another review that mentioned the same deal and when they replaced it....it was the same.  My wife had the crispy chicken.  It was tough and had an odd sweet sauce on it.  The mashed potatoes again tasted precooked previously and re-warmed....watery if you know what I mean. She really did not eat it...just picked at it.  For desert, I had the coffee crème brulee which I love and have really never had a bad one....except for now....it really was not good.  Having read other reviews like this...I dismissed them as outliers.....It is distressing to have to write this after my high expectations, but it was a $150 learning.

Bartender was fantastic!! I got a couple samples and decided on their TentCity IPA. Table got ready and we went into this back room and that's where the evening turned to bad. The room we were in still looked to be under construction a bit. The chair around this table were in bad shape like the screws were loose on them I do not mean 1 or 2 chairs either very wobbly as well. So we had to chase some one down to replace a few chairs.  We finally got to meet our waiter who showed up to work in basketball shorts and a tee shirt seriously basketball ball shorts really.. So he gets our food order and our next round of beers and we wait and wait, finally you guessed it SOME of our food came out agian large party of course not all the food can come out at once  but dam half the people were done eating before some us got our food while still waiting on our beers WTF is going on 48.. It should state 48 minutes in between food and drink!!! So now the food and beer finally shows up now we are eating while people are finished completely ridiculous.. So as we all finish 2 people in my party order another beer and wait after 10 minutes the come back and give them 2 different beers and say they ran out of the kind of beer ordered so they picked the closest beer to what they ordered agian WTF why would you choose someone else's drink. I mean you have basketball shorts on run back to the table and ask if there is something else you may like or maybe bring a sample but don't pour a pint and guess what I want.... Food was barely above dive bar food. Not sure what's going on at 48 but there is alot of room for improvements... I have read alot of the reviews and see the owners/management reads and responds to Yelp community so it's up in the air whether they will do anything but we can warn other Yelpers.. My beer was good, wife's beer was good.  I will give another shot if I am out that way only for the beer if you belly up to the bar.. Seems that only the bartender's gave any care.

Only thing this place has going for it is the darling decor. That is not enough to ever bring us back.",2
10657,1,1546992000000,"Just went back for my second visit - I would say this place really rates 3.5 stars but not quite a 4.    The first visit was during the week  at lunch time and today's visit was Saturday at around 10:50.  On both visits, our wait time was under 10 minutes.  (However, we once tried to go once on a Sunday and the line was out the door so we didn't even try to get in.) 

The place is open, sunny and cheery with a sort of country-kitchen  decor. The service has been so-so on both of my visits, but not terrible.  But no matter, the food  was good.  Today I had blueberry-banana whole wheat pancakes with scrambled eggs. The dish also comes with 2 pieces of thick-cut smokehouse bacon.  However since I don't eat pork, I asked for the chicken apple sausage in lieu of the bacon.  The pancakes had good flavor and texture. (The syrup was decent, but they really should serve pure maple without charging extra for it.)  The scrambled eggs were tasty with a nice texture and the sausage had nice flavor and textrure as well. 

David ordered the potato pancakes with scrambled egg whites and pork sausage.  He thought the potato-pancakes were pretty good but he prefers applesauce rather than the diced apples (just a personal preference on his part).   The coffee is decent - not the best in the world, and not the worst.  We do like the fact that they bring a carafe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills. (This is a big deal for me & David - we need our coffee!) 

The only thing that almost ruined today's experience for me was the fact that after our orders were put in, our server came over and told me that there would be a charge for substituting the chicken sausage for the bacon.  I said that was fine.  But he didn't explain what he really meant is that I would be charged for the plate (including the bacon) plus charged for a side order of chicken sausage (despite the fact that I did not get  bacon - If I had known that, I would have just kept the bacon on my plate - to give to David - and ordered a side of Chicken Sausage).  

Now, don't get me wrong,  I have no problem paying an ""upcharge"" when the item I want to substitute costs MORE than the item that comes on the plate... but when the item I wanted costs LESS than the item that I asking to leave off, I think it is silly for the restaurant to charge more.  (Plus, it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth and makes me think twice about whether I want to go back or not.) 

In the case of the bacon here- (which I did NOT want ) - a side order costs $3.95 while a side of the chicken sausage costs $3.50.  We did complain at the checkout and said that we were willing to pay a ""upcharge""  but we did not think it was fair to simply be charged for a side order of chicken sausage when we didn't also get the bacon.  So, the hostess/manager quickly took care of it  and took the extra charge off our bill. I thanked her for taking care of it, but I have to say the restaurant needs to rethink their policy because a lot of people may have just walked away angry. 

The prices were pretty standard  for breakfast places that we frequent  (between $26 - $28 for 2 before tip).",2

It turns out that I had a decent time.  The bartender knew exactly what I wanted, and the food options that I saw were not too bad.  Now, it still was a little bit dirty, so I'm only going to give this a three stars.  It certainly does it's job if you are looking for a drink.",3

Case and point, recently got a poutine that had ""prime rib beef"" but it was all grey coloured, overcooked ground beef. I don't see any reason you would waste prime rib meat by cooking it that way. Their fries are so/so, never quite crispy enough on the outside, or soft enough on the inside, their curds and sauce lack a lot of taste. I also find their to-go boxes make sure all the gravy drowns out the fries at the bottom so they get really soggy, fast.

But, instead he asked me very rudely that what re you doing and told me that cant you see the sign that machine is not working (that too when i already said sorry to him quite nicely and again i still do not know where the sign was :)).

I feel its quite a bad behavior on their part and customers should not be treated like this.

P.S: I came out without buying anything.",2

10699,1,1547683200000,The only reason this place gets a 5 star is because the of the burgers. They are really yummy like having a burger at your buddies bbq party. As for the rest of the food. Its terrible. The fries are frozen even though the seem to want to brag about the fact that the burger meat is never frozen. Then why not do the same with your fries.

10704,3,1547942400000,"My friends got a hotel here the night of our wedding. We had a blast. We had a nice suite with a livingroom, kitchenette and bedroon with 2 beds. The couch pulled out to another bed. The room had a beautiful view of Mellon Park.

The lobby of the hotel is kind of odd. Instead of the first floor it is on the 25th floor. The building shares space with offices and other places. I believe the hotel is the 2nd half of the building (beginning 12th floor maybe) Security is strict and you need your room key to even push your floor number (except for the 25th floor lobby of course)

This hotel also includes breakfast. It has your basic breakfast of potatoes, meat, scrambled eggs, pancakes, cereal ect. There is also a line for made to order food such as eggs Benedict. My group was hungover and decided to just get a quick breakfast rather than waiting in line for made to order.

The breakfast was very very disappointing. Eggs were horrible and tasted like those pre made eggs you microwaves. Potatoes looked good but had no flavor they were cold and had no crisp to them. The only thing good was the French toast which had hints of cinnamon in it. This hotel is gigantic and only offered a small area for all guests to get juice and coffee.

While the hotel was gorgeous and rooms were nice, the free breakfast at this more upscale hotel was subpar",2

Keep an eye out for your weekly mailers......usually they have coupons for a $9.99 or $11.99 wash and cut.

Also the addition of lychee in the curry which was not listed on the menu was interesting, I'm usually anti lychee but i tried it and it was absolutely amazed. The non rice sushi thing was pretty good too, We also shared the crepe cake which is what brought us in, the thai tea sauce was great! and the green tea ice cream was also good. The cake though was lacking, the filling in the crepe layers could have used some flavor, it was kind of bland, the thai tea sauce should be in the layers. All in all pretty tasty. When we got the check, the lady never came back to get the card, had to go up to the counter where she was talking to someone to get her to take my money.

They did not politely offer a new table and ended up discriminating us as a group. They did not believe that I was telling the truth. (Since I too do not hear well, they decided that we all fall into the same bucket) The worst part? We were coming as a group for a friend's birthday and that person felt quite depressed when he was rejected by the staffs for something he did not do.

Important to point out: I also requested an estimate for my mother in laws return box to be replaced. She had a new HVAC installed a couple years ago and although it's a great unit the installer never took the time to check out the return box. It was from 1964 and was pretty weird and non conventional in its shape requiring special filters. Scott Bird came out to estimate the replacement. Again, 5 star service.

10776,1,1546473600000,"I go hard at Sephora...usually the Walnut St. location but Ross Park is more convenient.  I go there 2x/month and spend 200-500 each visit (I know thats awful). You'd figure at this point I'd be able to get some friggin' help from the sales GIRLS, but no.

The only reason I go back to this location is because of the sales GUY. I don't know his name, but he has a shaved head with a spider tattoo and is AWESOME. Every time I'm there, he remembers me, my skin type, what we've gotten in the past and what I need. He spends times with me...he doesn't hawk over me and bug me. He's SO MUCH more knowledgeable than the other girls there who are just plain RUDE. 

I went there yesterday and unfortunately my guy wasn't there.  I asked for help, and told the girl I wanted to try a new primer. She pointed at one, and while I was checking it out, I told her that I needed some new eye contour palettes and needed help picking one out. But, she had already walked away. Weird...? I continued looking at palettes my damn self, couldn't pick one out, so I said screw it I'll just get them all. I picked up a basket and threw 3 palettes in. The SECOND these birds saw me pick up 3 palettes they all stopped their little side convo and came hopping on over ""can I help you"" ""would you like me to hold these at the register for you"" blah blah blah...oh NOW you all are interested in helping me? When a minute ago you wouldn't even help me pick out a primer? I see you, ladies....

I continued, on my own, and took all of my product related questions to you tube. When I was finished about 90 minutes later I took my basket to check out. There was a laminated Sephora slip in my basket...I know exactly what this is...but I didn't put it there. When someone helps you pick out products, they give you their card with their ID and a barcode on it. This helps them ""keep track"" of who helped us pick out products. NO ONE helped me pick out anything. One of these girls actually slipped their card into my basket wanting credit for my purchases. How disgusting is that!!!!

From now on, I'll be calling ahead to see if the gentleman employee is there. Otherwise, no thanks.

Sephora, if you read these, you need to make this kid a manager or something (if he isn't already) and do some serious training/revamping. Judging by these reviews, I'm not the only person who thinks these girls are rude and only interested in commission, not actually helping the customer.

They said the rooms were recently renovated but they need to call the show catch a contractor because they didn't finish the job. 2 elevators were out so I could have either walked 4 flights up and down the stairs or wait 10 minutes for the elevator. Cold showers. Water is too hot then too cold. Something was wrong with my heating unit. Every 10 minutes it would start up and make an annoying loud sound for about 15 seconds. I refused to have my room cleaned because I felt the floor maids were unprofessional. As I was waiting for the elevator about 3 of them were cleaning rooms and talking loud about the guest who recently stayed in the room using vulgar language and so on. Coming in from a night at the bar you are hungry. They have no small store or anything to grab a quick snack and the 24hr room service is just sandwiches. The people st the font desk were hit or miss. Some people were friendly and helpful others acted as if you were bothering them. It was about 1 AM and a group of front desk people were standing around and I asked them about room service and they looked at me like I said something crazy.

We started to order the normal nigiri....everything that came out was just alright....nothing too fresh.  95% of the rolls had spicy tuna and a ton of rolls had cream cheese in it.

Placed a ""to go"" order 3 small pizzas, 2 with pepperoni and 1 with pepperoni and sausage, all with Asiago flavored crust. I walked in to Hungry Howies to pick up my order and the restaurant was empty.  However, it still took over 5 minutes for an employee to acknowledge I was there and  to get my order. 

The pizza honestly was one of the worst take-out pizzas I have ever had from Hungry Howies and the order wasn't even correct. I wish I would have looked at my order prior to leaving the store.  I called Hungry Howies to let them know that not only was the pizza not very good but my order wasn't correct.  The associate who answered the phone response was ""Sorry bout that, not sure who cooked it.  I guess we can cook another"".  After waiting another 20 minutes to cook another pizza I head back up to Hungry Howies and yes, once again my order wasn't correct (wrong flavor crust). Since I wasn't willing to wait another 20 minutes I took the pizza and headed home.

My previous experiences with Hungry Howies has always been hit or miss. I think I will drive a little further to one of the many other pizza places in my area.",2

10833,2,1548115200000,"An awesome choice for producer direct beef, Silver Sage offers great quality products at prices that aren't that far off the supermarket. While not certified organic, the humanly raised, pasture fed, grain finished beef has fantastic flavor and is available in a nice range of steaks and roasts, with custom cutting available if you ask.

Our go-to buys tend to be the lean ground beef for everyday use and the incredibly flavorful ground chuck for burgers. The chuck is more fatty and gristly than your regular lean or regular ground beef, but the taste absolutely blows everything else out of the water. Large primals can be had as roasts or cut into steaks, though I tend to go for the more flavorful utility cuts of flank-steak and flat-iron. The flat-iron steak deserves special mention as it features an almost tenderloin level of tenderness with a much beefier flavor (at a fraction of the price of tenderloin). My absolute go-to has to be the short-ribs however. These have to be some of the best cut, most beautifully marbled braising ribs I've found.  

The only downside I find is location and hours. As some of the other reviews mention, they can sell out of popular cuts on busy farmer's market days. Though if you place an order for the following weekend, they'll make sure to have it ready for you.

Oh, and one more thing, they've started stocking beautiful beef marrow bones. I haven't worked up the culinary gumption yet to try roasting these bad-boys, but that's on my list for the year.",2

I don't know how he does it but somehow in 20 minutes I'm completely cleaned up and looking like a million bucks.  In the past I've always given my haircuts a week or so before I finally said, ""ehh, no it looks ok.""  But with Clifford's haircut it comes out looking great right away.  And that's not even the best part.  The best part is that somehow he uses magical powers to keep my haircut looking good as it grows out.  I used to have to get my hair cut every month to avoid looking like a feral sheepdog, but somehow these hair cuts last two months.  They actually look better as time goes on.  It's actually kind of bizarre.  

Clifford is the man!  The ambiance of this place is great too.  It's like stepping into a time machine.  It reminds me of going and getting haircuts with my dad when I was younger.

10847,2,1548633600000,"I think this was my favorite restaurant in Toronto. We loved it. We settled into the bar area, just us initially although the rest of the space was bustling. The high vaulted ceilings give the place a dramatic feel as do the oversized renaissance-esque paintings looming over the bar in the background. It's a cool, dimly lit space. 
My husband ordered the Barrel aged wise guy - rum based cocktail, pre mixed. It smelled smokey and the run was fragrant but not overly syrupy. He next opted for the manhattan. He was happy. Nothing earth shattering but good. 
I had a White sangria which was mild and lightly flavorful. It had diced apples and a few small pieces of strawberry. Not super sweet as many American versions are. I wasn't in love with it so I ordered a red sangria instead for my next beverage. Overall in Toronto, I found the wine seriously lacking which is why I ditched my standard pour to try the sangria. Again with the red it was very mild, not incredibly sweet and the taste of the wine was minimal. It was just OK. Better than the white but not stellar. I think I was missing more of the fruit flavors typically accompanying sangria. After the sangria the bartender offered me a sampling of a Tempranillo for $15 Canadian that'd caught my eye. Par for the course it was young & almost tart. I passed but this was a common experience with every wine I ordered in Toronto so I don't hold it against them. 

The interior is Beautiful and set back from the main strip. A kind, attentive female bartender who seemed interested in her cocktail crafting took care of us and the entire restaurant. She was a busy woman but handled it well. 
I loved their menu & wish we'd eaten here instead. The menu was heavy with Spanish tapas listings to include many dishes featuring manchego cheese. 
We ordered the bacon wrapped dates and they were exquisite. Everything you'd imagine from the name. The sweet, warm texture of the date complimented by the crisp bacon and warm, creamy manchego. The salty, pork flavor from the bacon paired perfectly with the sweet flesh of the date. To top it off it was drizzled in authentic maple syrup. Part appetizer, part dessert. All parts phenomenal. 
I seriously enjoyed them so much I thought about ordering a second helping. I didn't & instead ordered the almonds which were a small portion given the price and were underwhelming. I'd skip those and probably get the olives next time.",2

From start to finish it was a pleasure doing business with this establishment.  I had contacted the club manager, Andrew, about a week prior to coordinate bottle service.  He is a consummate professional, very friendly, and genuinely cares about the patrons having an enjoyable experience.  It is rare to run into any individual, in any vocation, who sacrifices their own personal resources and time to ensure that a customer is satisfied, but Andrew does just that.  The staff and entertainers are unparalleled.  The bartenders and waitresses are kind and quick to serve.  The men's bathroom attendant is, hands down, the best I've experienced in any restaurant, bar, or venue of any sort.  I've been to several clubs, around the world, and this is the first establishment, that I've been to, where all of the performers are extremely attractive.  The dancers, just like the rest of the staff, genuinely want the customers to enjoy themselves.  They aren't simply looking to rack up as many dances as possible.  All of them make it a point to interact and converse with the club patrons.  They're engaging, witty, not pushy, and again, very pretty.  We enjoyed bottle service during our visit, and I strongly recommend that you do the same.  It is reasonably priced and gratuity is included.  If you are rolling in a group the cost will split up nicely, and one would expect to spend a comparable amount on drinks throughout the night anyway.  Although located about fifteen minutes from the Las Vegas Strip, the Palomino offers a free shuttle service to the club and also back to your hotel once your night has come to a close.  Additionally, taking advantage of the shuttle results in the door cover charge being waived.  There is absolutely no reason not to take advantage of this fantastic amenity, and you should certainly thank the staff and entertainers by enjoying drinks and dances with the money you saved on transportation and cover.  I've been to Treasures and Sapphire, and while they are nice, they do not hold a candle to the experience of the Palomino Club, because that is what it is, an experience.  The other establishments are simply clubs.  After our wonderful Friday night, my friends and I decided to punctuate our weekend with another trip to the Palomino late Saturday (early morning Sunday), and we were greeted with the same energy we had seen Friday.  After that weekend and how well we were treated, my party agreed that the Palomino would be a staple for us, and we would not visit Vegas without spending some time with them.  Highest possible recommendation.",3
10875,2,1546300800000,"The food here is always good as you watch them cook your food to order.  Better selections as of lately as it seems they've changed their menu a bit since my last visit this past summer.  

They reserve seating apparently.  I saw several tables reserved the entire time we were there (1:20) and they were never used.   It posed a challenge for my party of 3 to be able to find a seat.  They need to do that better.  The big issue on this Friday even was the noise level.  It caused my family and I to have to raise our voices quite a bit to talk to each other at the table we did find.  Not a pleasurable experience in the least.",3

My server was Fernando- really nice - normal and just friendly. Food was outstanding.. very good - thank you!!!,2
10880,1,1548460800000,"Really glad to see Panera make its way to Markham!  It's always busy whether it be opening week or any regular day. The reason? I think it's the food selection and the vibe. 

Choice of food include bagels, various kinds of breads, cookies, quiche, sandwhiches, soups, salads, coffee and tea, eurppean coffee drinks, smoothies, etc... I really like their muffies. The first time I had one was in their California location. and now whenever I go to any Panera, I always get a muffie, which is a soft muffin-top like cookie. It's now my thing. Their coffee drinks are pretty good, brewed coffee is self serve and it shows you the time on each roast so you know you're getting a fresh cup! 

Plenty of seating and lots of sunshine make this place ideal for catching up with friends or reading your textbook. But what really keeps people here is the free wireless internet. 

And remember to get the Panera card. You register online and every once in a while, they email you and let you know they loaded a ""surprise"" on your card that you can redeem in-store. With so many choices of food in our city, sometimes I like to switch it up, but then I get the email and I'm back to Panera again. They sure know how to get their customers to stay loyal! Nothing says ""we value you"" like free baked goods and coffee!",2

She was very helpful and gave me all the information that I needed. She made a great smoothie and was very pleasant and friendly.

3.Gyro came with slices of bad tasting meat.
4. Fries were cold and soggy on arrival.
Somehow hotels let this place slide menus under room door, I now see why they do this.
They are trying to take advantage of tourist not familiar with area. But thanks to yelp, we can help save people time and money one review at a time.

We bought our tickets through halfpriceshows.com  We got the ruby package for $35 instead of the normal $60 from the box office.  The package included a free well drink or beer, a free sexy picture of you on their prop pole, a cute t-shirt, and official ""stripper license"".   The class went by quickly we were having so much fun and were amazed by ""Vanessa"", the instructor.  5 minutes into the class you forget she's 7 months pregnant!!  I mean she could do stuff on that pole that had our mouths dropping open.

I do highly recommend doing the class in heels.  I went with two friends.  One remembered to grab her heels, the other one and I wore flip flops.  You can still do the lap dance moves easily without, but I think the pole stuff might have been easier with them.

He was extremely rude and condescending. 

Worked with Joe who was your typical car salesman, over promise, under deliver. We couldn't get the deal done, which I expected. I was asking a lot. 

I tried to focus on total price and pressured me into focusing on payment. When did dealerships start ""if I can do this, this, and this do we have a deal? If so sign here"". I questioned this as I don't was tv to sign anything until the deal is done. Joe preceded to tell me he was once a lawyer and that the signature meant nothing but you commitment to a deal before they put in all this ""hard work"". Asked him what he's doing there if he was a lawyer and he didn't want to talk about it. 

Joe could never get there but was close. Wife was out of town so I wads making phone calls to her and Joe and Walter White took that as my wife wouldn't let me get the car and proceeded to bully me by saying ""you signed this... it doesn't say here pending if wife let's me get car"" then Heisenberg looked at my 2 boys 14 and 11 and said ""see boys if you sign something you should honor it"".

That was it for me... I had some words with Cojack and he slithered away. Joe apologized and I left. 

Joe called again and apologized, I could tell he was embarrassed. Joe was fine. I appreciated the call. 

Then couple hours later another manager called to see why I didn't buy the car. Told this story and never planned to leave a review until he defended the managers behavior. Threw out lines like ""we have to feed our families"". He said makes people sign along the way because 70% come in and don't make a deal, ""don't want to do all that work for no deal""... Isn't that your job? 

Tried to hand me a line that he's Irish and we... I cut that off, reminded him I'm Irish Italian from Philly... Said don't call me... 

I suggest you look elsewhere. Liberty Buick is across the street and awesome!",1

All of the girls working were super friendly and prompt. The owner was also there, working alongside everyone. 
I ordered a supreme pizza. It was awesome. The crust was crunchy, pizza was not greasy and the sausage was awesome. The sausage is fresh ground sausage placed on the pizza, not frozen sausage chunks (yuck) like most places.

I enjoyed it, and will stop back to try the pasta next time I'm in the area.",1
10925,2,1546300800000,"50% off wine Sunday good!  $5.00 burger Monday good!  Not to mention the best Hot Vings this side of the Half Court Marker!

Happy hour, brunch, cheap wine and fresh fruit Sundays, and yep... $5.00 burgers and fries after 6:00 on Monday... it's a no-brainer.  I'll admit that the reason we moved into the amazing neighborhood that 16th Street and Bethany Home has become is due, in significant part, to the Vig.  Like they say ""Let's just go to the Vig!""

Although I am stumbling distance from this brilliant looking establishment that reminds me of a modernized Brady Bunch rumpus room, it's really the whole experience that has won me over.  Even the menu is basement casual with an uptown slant... from the Deconstructed Fish Taco Salad, to the Holy Mac N' Cheese, or the Legalize Pot Roast it really ties the room together, man.

The Trifecta is their slider platter, which hits the pallino every time and as my father-in-law put it ""has the perfect meat to bun ratio.""

My Tip:  Slip into the ""faux patio"" for some brilliant Bocce Ball court play.",2
10931,1,1548806400000,"My brother, sister, and I spent the last day of 2010 skydiving here. It was freezing cold, but amazing and definitely worth the price. The instructors were great and very friendly. They film your whole experience, whether you pre-purchase it or not. My brother ended up buying a video for about $150, which I think is a bit pricey. With that money, I'd rather go for a second jump!

The view from this place is gorgeous. I wasn't able to see the strip, but I saw hills, the lake, the river, a golf course. The instructor lets you navigate a bit, which was a lot of fun. My brother's only advice, mostly applicable to men..is to make sure the leg straps aren't too tight, otherwise, you'll have quite an uncomfortable landing.

10940,2,1547078400000,"Super cute! Like super cute! My friend and I sat at the bar outside so we were basically right in the kitchen and we got to see all the action. It was very entertaining to see all the moving pieces in the creation of their dishes. Plus, they play some damn good music. It went so well with the nice, not too hot not too cold, summer weather and the upbeat vibe of the restaurant. 

We went to get the jalapeño margaritas, which my friend told me was a must try. It was good, I must admit because I've given up on margaritas. They're just too sweet for me. However, the jalapeño margarita was a nice balance. It wasn't sweet and it didn't taste like they used a mix. The jalapeño provided a slight heat but it was far from hot. One of the salsas we got was spicier than the drink. It worked out well in the cocktail. They aren't shy with the alcohol either but the drink didn't taste too strong. Everything balanced out well. Must try! 

We ordered chips and salsa trio and the burrata. The salsas were fresh and so were the chips. The chips weren't overly salty either, which I like because I stay away from salty foods. The burrata was okay, not the best I've had but okay. It didn't have anything that gave me a lot of flavor. The heirloom tomatoes were freshly cut and delicious but it tasted like the dish was missing something. 

I didn't try the tacos but I will saw, Tako has some of the best dish presentation I've ever seen. Their chefs take pride in their dishes and how it's presented to the customers and I could tell the whole time we were sitting there. It didn't even matter how busy they were (and they were busy), they freshly prepared each dish. They took their time and everything moved so fast even with the chefs being perfectionist about their plating. 

Cute place for a drink. If I go back, I'll try a taco.",2

Seriously, if you appreciate Middle Eastern food, you will absolutely love Sofra. It instantly brought back memories of Turkish food I experienced when I was a kid who spent summers in Turkey. Did I mention their pistachio baklava alone is worth a trip there? It's THAT good.",2
10955,2,1548720000000,"Disclaimer: I ordered take out and have not yet eaten in the restaurant. 

That said, my experience was not appetizing at all. The fish was beyond oily (see picture) and was quite smelly (fresh fish should not have a ""fishy"" scent). There was clearly no seasoning on the fish, nor in the batter, as it was entirely bland. The fries were also unseasoned... Always salt fries when they come out of the fryer - that's basic technique. Overall, a highly disappointing meal. 

I'd say I'd give this place another try, but my colleagues say they've eaten in the restaurant and had the very same experience. I blame them for not warning me ahead of time. Folks, this is my warning to all of you!!!

I have to hand it to them though, it was slammed and the customer service was still great and we really didn't have to wait very long to get our food.

The food options were also a welcomed surprise compared to the usual turkey sandwiches you would expect at an airport.

10979,1,1547683200000,"Vegas definitely has a number of AYCE sushi restaurants and we've tried some of them before including Oyshi and Goyemon. The latter are really good, but we wanted to try some place new. I decided to Yelp for an AYCE sushi place and stumbled on Sakana--boy am I glad that we did! Hands down one of the best AYCE in Vegas! Price for lunch AYCE IS $21.99 and dinner is $24.99.

The restaurant itself is located in a small plaza with ample parking, although it can get relatively full. The actual restaurant is quaint with cute japanese/sea inspired decors inside. We were seated right away and first thing I noticed on the wall were the recommendations by the Chefs. I found this to be nice, specially since it was our first time going there and as like any new comers, we may need help picking either the most popular or the favorites of the Chefs.

The service itself was great. Never once did we have any empty water glasses and everyone was really nice and polite. The food came out pretty quickly as well, which was a plus.

In terms of the food, all the sushi and apppitizers we tried were delicious! I do recommend for the appetizers to try the pork belly, shrimp tempura, baked mussels, and something called ""The Shit,"" which is a stuffed pepper with crab meat.

For the sushi, we tried the Golden Tiger, the Poki/Crab Meat Nachos, the Monkey Brain, the Lemon Shrimp, the Albacore and the Yellowtail. Again, all were very tasty and fresh! Some of the flavor profiles will surprise you, like the Monkey Brain, which plays on the sweet and savory taste as it mixes sauteed banana with the California Roll. Sounds weird, I know, but it is absolutely delicious! 

I definitely would recommend everyone to try this place out! If you're an avid sushi fan or just looking for a nice Japanese restaurant to eat at, this place can cater to all. If you don't want the AYCE option, you can also just order per entree. Definitely a must try in Vegas!",2

First off, crinkle fries are delicious and just because they are crinkled, doesn't always mean they are frozen.  I don't know whether these are frozen or not and I don't really care, because they were hot, fresh, and tasty.  Let's get rid of the ketchup packets though guys.  You've got classy stainless steel ramekins and then ask guests to fill up them up with packets.  If you're looking for cost savings, have a ketchup pump in the back.

Now for sandwiches... Buffalo Chicken was made with juicy grilled chicken, Bleu cheese and celery slices on a garlic bread bun.  Celery slices are a really nice touch and make this more unique instead of just putting lettuce on it.  If I ordered it again,  I'd get double celery, a little less buffalo sauce, and add tomatoes.  The Steak sandwich was tasty with tender meat pieces and crispy onion straws.  Great sandwiches. 

Atmosphere:  Yes, of course this place doesn't have much curb appeal because of the 'eh' plaza it's in (but they can't help that).  Inside is clean and cooks/server were all friendly and passionate about their food.  Decor needs some work.  They've got something going with some pipe work on the wall, but it needs something else...maybe some pictures of people/food/places and not maps.  Lighting is kind of cool, but again needs some refinement.  Wouldn't mind if there was some music too.

Bottom line: tasty food, friendly people that are passionate about food, average atmosphere, low curb appeal neighborhood.",3

Overall food, service and ambiance amazing for a little joint nestled on 17th street in the heart of the south side.  The parking truly sucks but that is to be expected in this part of town.  The food including pasta, steak, apps and desert all best in class.  This little gem would do very well and flourish if plucked out of Pittsburgh and dropped on to Manhattan island.

Woohoo - we now finally have a restaurant to look forward to when visiting my home town.",3

11069,1,1548288000000,"The review of this seafood place is for dinner that we experienced as a group. 2 times within a month. So I think I can have my say in this place now...

First time, when I called for Father's Day dinner. Booked more than 2 weeks in advance. Was advised in advance that we would only have the table for 2 hours, which is totally fine. 

We were somewhat expecting the dishes to be like Fishman Lobster House in Scarborough where the seafood is topped up and we would be stuffed...from our previous numerous experiences...so we ordered a 5 person set dinner for 7 ppl.. 

The food dishes were particularly small,  in comparision, the ambience and seating area was better than Fishman Lobster House...(1 star)...nothing was Wow or spectacular in terms of taste...lobster deep fried, fish had a muddy taste, steamed king crab was the best thing perhaps... 

Around 7:15, when all the dishes arrived and we started eating maybe a quarter thru, they kept on asking us if they can take it and pack it away...I'm like is it time for us to give the table back? They said no. So why were they rushing us leave? They claim 2 hours but they want you to leave before 1.5 hours..epic fail....( minus 2 stars) I want to enjoy my food and company, not gobble down and leave....this is not a hk cafe... please...

The second time, same thing, rushing us to leave and realizing after the fact they didn't provide all the dishes on the menu..

So that's their business strategy..sit down, order the most expensive from the menu and rush you to leave so you won't have time to enjoy and figure out what was missing from the set...

I have way better places to spend my $600-1000 dollars please  with way better service and food.... not coming back...",1

11099,1,1548547200000,Burgers and fries were tasty.  French fries do not come with burgers.  Burger arrived on a plate alone and the plate looked bare.  Very odd layout for a restaurant.  There are about six tables that are right by the kitchen.  We were seated at the table across from the kitchen doors.  It was loud and chaotic as all the servers were passing our table within arms reach of us.  We could see in to the kitchen.  The doors leading in to the kitchen are black and had greasy hand prints all over them which was grossing me out as I ate.  The bars sits somewhat out in the middle of the restaurant so the back tables see the back of the bar.  There is an additional beverage/dessert bar that is waste of space.  The women's bathroom feels like an outhouse.  I am willing to pay a buck for a burger but I need a bit more atmosphere.  Went there on the first weekend or second they opened so overstaffed and hectic.  Even the hostesses were confused.  What appeared to be the owner or manager walked around using his cell phone most of the time looking overly anxious.,1

Unfortunately we couldn't eat or drink everything we ordered, so some of it was left behind. I did however manage to fly home our peanut butter pie.... which is to die for. Doug was our server and he did a fantastic job taking care of us. They treated us to a complimentary dessert for our anniversary which was also very special. We will be back for sure!!!! Mahalo!",2

The to go woman was very friendly and the food was carried out to us within a three minutes of us pulling into the designated parking space.
When we got home and looked at the food we were dissapointed.  The portions were very small and since when does ""cajun"" mean burnt and shriveled?  
The queso blanco was okay but a little salty.  Luckily they put the jalepnos on the side and gave us a good portion of chips.
The three cheese chicken penne was DRY.  There was barely any sauce on the pasta and the portion was small.
The bourbon street chicken and shrimp was a joke.  A miniscule burnt dry chicken breast next to some dry ass potato chunks that were so salty that you could see the grains of salt on the potato skin and about 5 burnt shriveled up sliced mushrooms.
One star for the price and one star for the to go woman.  Thats it.",2

Dont be misled by the long line you see when you get there, theres gonna be a line, if the place hasn't opened yet...


Soon as the place opened everyone was quickly accommodated.... 

There's a small cafeteria inside in case you wanna get cozy, but the quick dash system which will literally text you when your turn is coming up gives you the opportunity to do some quick groceries...

Having gone early my number was called pretty quickly, and the process itself took around 3 hours tops, that includes a test pictures waiting and paying fees

11119,3,1548633600000,"Absolutely unimpressive place. Came here due to the myriad of 5-star reviews. Drove twice around the carpark before realising this place is literally INSIDE the Lee Lee market, and there is NO sign, not even a sandwich board, indicating this on the outside! Went in and got seated immediately. Water brought out quick. Orders taken and served quick. That's where the delight ended. They didn't have the fresh coconut that I normally get so that was disappointing.  My ""large"" pho was ok, but I wouldn't classify it as a large. Maybe a medium. Broth tasted ok. Hardly any of the sliced beef balls or tripe, or in fact much meat at all. Small handful of bean sprouts and a single tiny lime slice provided. My kid had the crepe with bean sprouts, shrimp and pork. Yuck. I had some - the crepe tasted bland and ten minutes later, cold (my kid tried his best to delay actually eating any, can't blame him), I wouldn't have served it to a dog. Wife thought her vermicelli and BBQ pork was okay and liked the ""fresh"" taste, but thank god the fish sauce was on the side. Ugh. Absolutely NO table service after we'd started, not even offers to refill water. Had to get up and walk around to the tiny cash register to pay. Got back to table and sat down to wait for the kid to strangle down another couple of bites and that's when I had an ice water jug held in front of me as a refill offer. Nope, done.

This place is nowhere near as efficient or generous with their portions as either Pho Thanh (Camelback) or Da Vang (19th Ave). Those who think the prices are cheap need to understand that those prices are normal for a viet place. They're all this cheap, except the ridiculously-overpriced Rice Paper on 7th Ave. Go to Pho Thanh (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pho-thanh-phoenix), order the large pho dac biet for $6.75 and run a comparison of what you get.

It took me hours and one return trip to swap the modem as ""defective"" to learn that they had been told there was a 7-9 hour outage at the Rogers provisioning department and they knew my modem would not work when I got home.

I explained that I was following up from the previous week and that I just needed a new antibiotic prescription because the one they'd given me wasn't working and I was in pain - it would take less than 5 min.  The (not busy) receptionist said they were too busy because they had 3 patients in the clinic.  (3 patients in 45 minutes is too busy for an entire clinic?)

I have even had (I believe) the owner or manager wait on me when it's been very busy and I really appreciate the effort for customer service.  What keeps me from giving this place five stars is the rudeness by bouncers and/or bartenders once it hits 2:00 a.m. on the dot.  Being screamed at to get out is pretty unacceptable to me customer-service wise.  I understand the liquor laws.  I work in this industry.  I know legally patrons can be in an establishment until 2:30 a.m. without penalty as long as alcohol is not purchased after 2:00 a.m.  I appreciate the fact that employees want to close up and go home.

On the day of the estimate they never showed up on time and never called.  I called them and they told me they were running behind and would be another TWO HOURS LATE!!  They gave me an estimate which was reasonable.  A couple weeks later I decided to go with their company to do the repair.  ONCE AGAIN nobody answers phones and ONCE AGAIN I left TWO different messages on TWO different dates.  Nobody EVER returned my calls AGAIN.  OK SCREW THEM......

My daughter didnt really want to run across the Indiana Jones-ish bridge, or go down the tall wavy slides, but being the mother I am I made her go with me and the baby anyways. The baby smiled, oblivious to any ""fear"" and my daughter laughed and all seemed to be ok with mom there. By the way, the wavy slides are fast! I am glad that they allow parents in the play area and on the equipment, in the ball pit and on the slides with their little ones. It was not filled with adults but its a nice option if your child is a little nervous, or wants you to enjoy the fun too. After an hour of play they called us back to a room for birthday cake and pizza (the family arranged and brought their own food in) to celebrate.

I prefer my fish cut thinner but it was really fresh and delicious so I didn't mind the thicker cut. The rolls are also bigger here, make sure to ask for half rolls so you can try a lot. For appetizer, the shit is a must but the pang is so so, it had too much mayo. Oh yeah the mayo! They're kinda heavy on the mayo here so read the description of the rolls if you're not up for that kind of richness lol like the monkey brains had a LOT of mayo.

I live very close to this store but will drive several miles out of my way just to avoid this store. I will only go to this store if I am in desperate need of something quick. There are always tons of beggars and homeless people in front of the store and in the parking lot. You cannot get into the store or out of the store without being approached. I have told the security guards this is annoying and disturbing all the time but they always say there is nothing they can do about it.  It is very annoying and can be scary, but once you get into the store, the employees are very nice and very accommodating in helping find things and they do have good prices and good selections.  Going into the store is like a game, thinking ok once I get out of my car, which way should I attempt to get into the store quickly. No one should have to shop like this. They are not just begging for money, they are also rude. They asked my husband for money and he ignored them and they called him very bad names one time he went there.

I had called 1 week before to confirm the price and the dates and was told nothing about the enforcement of this ""rule"".When we got to the front registration desk we were told that the reason they are doing this is because "" the older guests that have been coming to this hotel don't like the noise and havoc that extra guests brings to the environment"" sorry but its vegas.... 3.On the first night staying at the hotel in room we found a cockroach on the wall above the nightstand this was not a normal small size cockroach it was definantly as long as my thumb.We called the front desk and had to be put on hold for 30 minutes we called them 2x because we kept getting put on hold. After we finally got someone to come out all they did was pick up the dead roach and didn't apologize or try to switch the room out. The ac was also having some major fails and wouldn't come out cold we had it all the way down to 60 and on high and it did not feel like it at all.

Finally we were given to this girl named JJ. She was actually half way decent and she complete the paperwork, emphasizing a one year warranty. However she keep asking us every 10 minutes to remember to post a review on Yelp. I was planning to wait until we had our first problem, and see how they respond, and boy was my gut on point. 


So we went into the mechanic shop a week later for the first time to look at our steering panel, knowing that it was a large issue that should be fixed and covered under the warranty. Immediately they were asking us for $$100$$ just to look at the car. This was BEFORE even opening the hood of the car. And the warranty covered NOTHING, it was more valuable as toilet paper.

One thing I forgot to mention was that the valets were really cool to talk to.  From the moment I got dropped off in my taxi, until the day I got into the taxi to go back to the airport, any of the valets I talked to all had a little Mike Canon (Las Vegas TV show reference) in them.

So the funniest story for me was when I was waiting for a taxi to go to Caesar's.... So these two very hot chicks come out, and the blonde one gives her ticket to the valet to pick up her car.  While waiting, she stops the other valet, takes off her sunglasses, and asks the valet for his honest opinion of whether he thinks her hair looks ""stupid"".  The valet, at a loss for words, stammers a little and says that she looks fine, and her hair looks very nice.  They exchange a few other words here and there, and then the car pulls up... a very shiny, very new looking, Mercedes CLS500.  My jaw hits the ground at how beautiful this car looks.

After they take off, the two valets start joking around, and I couldn't help joining in.  They kept saying ""Can you say.... sugar-daddy?""  My comment was that no one that stupid could be buying a Mercedes on their own unless sugar-daddy, trust-fund baby, or Paris Hilton.",2

They tell you right up front what you should and shouldn't replace and don't try to nickel and dime you on everything.  They put my car up on the lift and walked me all around it showing me everything that I should fix and why.  I needed to replace my timing belt and spark plugs for my 100K mile tune up.  My previous estimate I got from another company told me I needed to replace multiple other things (leaks and flushes) basically for no reason.

The waitstaff was very kind and friendly. However, there were only two waitresses for a packed, Saturday night room, and I suspect that the kitchen was even more understaffed. We literally waited an hour between each course. An HOUR. We chatted with the couple sitting next to us, who were apparently regulars, and they said that the service was always the same - unbelievably slow. They seemed to enjoy kvetching about the service while downing an unfathomable amount of alcohol - which might explain why they kept coming back despite the bad service. We, on the other hand, were just starving and annoyed.

Another annoying aspect of this place is that while it is BYOW, beer is forbidden. The waitress informed us that before the ban on beer, people would mix wine and beer together and get sick in the washrooms. This didn't stop people from sneaking beer from their purses - we noticed a bit of this, and we indulged ourselves - it just made drinking our two beers (without incident) unbelievably tacky-feeling and uncomfortable. The staff just didn't seem to understand that their clientele were getting stinking drunk, loud, and sick, not because they were mixing alcohol, but because they were being forced to wait three hours for a meal with nothing to entertain them but their wine.

In short, good food, but not worth the disappointing ambiance and the absolutely terrible service.",2

The Brunch menu is quite small with not a lot of selection. It wasn't until we left that we noticed there was a special but our waitress didn't mention it to us so how were we to know? 
After being seated and given menus it was at least 20 minutes before we could catch anyone's attention that we'd like to order. Once ordering we waited almost an hour for our food. Between four of us there were three sandwiched and one shak shuka. Not a complicated order by any means. Dad had the bagel which was a tiny bagel with smoked salmon and a side of lukewarm homefries and a salad. My husband had the Jewish Banh Mi which also had the sale sides. It had no flavor. My mum had the shak shuka and she loved it but the eggs were rock hard. I had the brisket sandwich and it was not very good. The brisket was dry and hard and had no flavor. The potatoes were cold and when I complained they brought new ones for the table that were just slightly warmer.
All in all it was a pretty disappointing trip to the west end. We'll definitely be going back but not to Essen.",2

Jason, I'd like to start off by thoroughly apologizing once again for your evening at Caswell. I understand that it was a bad experience and not what you had in mind for a family's night out. However, restaurant experience aside, I take personal issue with a lot of what you rushed home to Concord to put on the internet. Your server absolutely cared, as did I. You mistake not caring with being overwhelmed. If I didn't spend any time trying to make it right then how do I know that you recommend going to Twin Peaks for the games or Union St. to eat a good meal? I said we'd do our best to make your night go up from a poor start...and the way you inhaled your steak there's no doubt in my mind that it did. See guys like yourself ARE the problem with yelp. Cat has your tongue at the table but go home and pound the keyboard. At least you know your strengths. We had a rough go at it tonight but I assure we will learn from it and be better for it. Maybe I can offer you the same opportunity...you see, we operate restaurants to support our families and make a living. Little proof from tonight, but actually are pretty damned good at it too. There's not a yelp for me to come cherry pick and post your worst day at the office online and even if there was I'd probably opt to shake your hand and tell you you'll do better next time B/c shotgun reviews like yours actually affect people livelihood. But hey, all men aren't created equal... that's just how the cookie crumbles, sir. Take care, Jason G.",2

The sign came out great. It doesn't buzz and I haven't noticed that it gets hot. We went with a really beautiful aqua color.

Doubles weren't bad, a little soggy for my liking, but I'd get the doubles again.  The chicken roti on the other hand wasn't my favorite in the area.  Maybe I just got unlucky but I had alot of pink and gristly bits of chicken in the roti, I generally like to see at least some white meat but most of the pieces I got inside were a little gristly etc. for my tastes.  I much prefer the chicken roti at Vishnu's on Kennedy.  This one at Brampton Roti Shop is alot ""wetter"", more gravy I suppose where the one at Vishnu's is drier, but it's all about your own opinion..

We ordered a sampling of taquitos, empanada, tamale, and quesidilla.  We enjoyed all of it!!!  The food is very fresh and tasty, not at all like fast food or Frederico's.  It is a little strange to have the cook come and get the emapandas out of the glass cases where you are sitting. I agree with another reviewer who thinks they should keep some in the back. The timing of the kitchen was off for all of the diners who were there with us. I thought it had just opened two weeks ago until I saw Yelp reviews from January. The executive chef really needs to work with the cook to help him organize and manage his time. No problems with the product though, the flavors were wonderful! The menus are confusing because I saw one menu online and arrived to see different menu's on the chalkboards on the wall. I looked down on the counter and found the online menu and ordered from there ( which I recommend doing. The chalkboard items seem to be ""combo"" meals with soda. The portions are tiny but the cost is tiny also. We ate, with 20% tip for $19.00.  That said, neither of us were quite full so next time we will order 4 or more items each. The dining room is tiny but they have some nice patio tables once the weather is nice. I hope this little place makes it because the food is good, the price is reasonable, and the place settings so pretty. Hopefully, they can expand so the place is not quite so small.

I learned this first hand straight from the source on my most recent visit to The Big Easy, and though the gentleman running this shop is not from NOLA, you would never know it. He's got the ice making down to an art, and it shows. 

These cold treats are AMAZE-BALLS and make for the perfect snack on a hot PHX day. Even on a cold day...just yum. I was really into the egg custard, along with every other delicious concoction he twisted my arm into trying (har-har) Even after tons of sampling, we hung around the tiny shop just to socialize, as he was quite the conversationalist.

Definitely of huge fan of businesses that go the extra mile to put a smile on their customers faces and and am determined to return again and again to try every last combination he's come up with. They can't allll be OUTRAGEOUSLY delicious...can they?

When we first sat down she had heard us saying we wanted the Chicken Pakora & asked us if we wanted to order it now as it took 20 mins to prepare. However, we were still waiting for two others to arrive & didn't want to order anything yet. Then she kept coming back (2x?) to ask about the order.

From memory, we had...
Asian Garden Special Hakka Chow Mien - the photo in the menu looked better but still tasty.
Chili Chicken - tasty and a little spicy. i liked this more than the chicken pakora
Chicken Pakora - great w/ a little sauce
Shrimp Friend Rice - great for those who don't enjoy spicy foods. yum yum 
Beef Fried Rice - this was prob. my fav. there was a bit of spice in there and it really gave it a little kick

11404,2,1548547200000,"Excellent Indian, worth visiting, but you might want to ask for more heat (flavor)!

Pros
+Delicious flavors (we had the Mango Chicken and the Tikka Masala Chicken curries---even more delicious as leftovers a couple days later!)
+Very nice atmosphere
+AWESOME Towel service post-meal
+Fun mocktail drinks (with accompanying handmotions from the waiter) 
+Well seasoned (not too seasoned) paneer pakoras. VERY DELICIOUS paneer too!

Cons
-Men's bathroom smelled a little funny, and the entrance door seems thin/light-easy to get hit by. This is a minor issue, though.
-I asked for a good medium heat to my curry, not ""american medium"" but a ""strong medium,"" while my wife asked for mild. Our entries came out, and the plus was they didn't mix up our spice levels --- sometimes that happens --- but my ""strong medium"" was really like a mild, wasn't that spicy (but I do love spice, so be warned), while the ""mild"" was as bland as nearly any Japanese cuisine aspires to be for its ""subtle"" flavors. It was quite disappointing to miss out of the fullness of flavor that heat brings to curries. With a bit more salt and pepper (to try to bring some more heat out), the mild was made better, but perhaps the ""mild"" is perfect for people who really can't take ANY spice...however for people who are used to spice, but don't want ""burn your mouth"" hot, go for medium I would say.

The service was mediocre when we asked if there was wifi, and the reply we received was that ""we want our customers to enjoy the food"", yet with their incredibly slow service, it was impossible not to fiddle with our smart phones. 
I believe this place is worth a try if you get a great deal with groupon or other alternatives. Otherwise I recommend another place for japanese cuisine.",3

In order to do a little work I needed a booth with a power outlet.  I went into the bar and they said that the only table's with an outlet were in the dinning room.  So I went to the host/waiter and ask for a table with a power outlet.  I was then told that there wasn't a server in that section so I couldn't sit there.  I said that I needed a plug for my computer and that is when I was told that I would probably need to go somewhere else because they can't help me.

WOW!!

I was surprised they didn't want my business considering there was only like 4 tables sat in the whole restaurant.  

So I went to Majerle's instead.",2
11453,1,1546732800000,"Amidst Thai massage not being my favorite, I definitely feel more relaxed after my session last night...

I enjoy how the Foot Reflexology service is not solely just for feet - you will get a face, head, shoulder, back, and leg massage, in addition to the obligatory Thai stretching techniques. I find that Thai massage always leaves me wanting more, though. I like how this type of massage begins with accessing pressure points but then I do not feel that the muscle is actually worked. In particular, we went there for out feet to get a serious rub down when in fact, my back massage was my favorite aspect of the massage. 

Customer service was pleasant, they have loose clothing to change into if necessary, the room is open so you will sit next to someone else getting work done (unless you are doing a full Thai massage which that area has a privacy curtain), I was refreshed with good green tea afterwards, and the cost was just right.

I would still say that this is a good place for someone who appreciates Thai massage.",2
11453,3,1547769600000,"I used to be a hardcore bemani player, always hanging out at the infamous Arcade Infinity playing DrumMania and Guitar Freaks until my fingers were ready to fall off. While I've been out of the ""scene"" for a few years, my friend told me about this place to check out if I were in area.

So I happened to go to Vegas one weekend, and I remembered, ""oh I gotta check out the new amazing arcade!"" Basically, if you are a fan of DM/GF/Beatmania IIDX/Pop n' Music/DDR/ITG, this is DEFINITELY the place to check out.

The owners and staff are reeeeeeally nice and knowledgeable, and really opened up this arcade just for the bemani and dance/rhythm gamer community, and are even doing it at a loss. And the care and love really shows as this place is impeccably clean, well stocked, and spaced out really well. Many arcades are cramped with mediocre ventilation. This place positions games really well and just has a good vibe to it.

Even if you aren't a fan of music games they have a few fighting games, even an old school mario cabinet, claw games, air hockey, pool, and even (free!) foozeball.

Oh..and the prices are amazing. No tokens, they take quarters. 50c for three songs on DM/GF, that is probably the best price I've ever seen for the game not set on free play. The DrumMania machine is also in the best condition I've ever seen it in, anywhere (yes I've played a LOT of DM in Japan, and all over California as well). Very good sensitivity, very good bounce on the pads, and clean and in new condition.

The other vibe I like about this arcade is that serious or nice casual gamers come into play (at least when I was there on a Saturday afternoon), there are no random kids screaming or people abusing machines.

There is also an open section with TV where people can bring their own consoles or games to play with a friendly environment.

If you like music games, curious about them, or just love a well maintained and great arcades in general, this is definitely not to be missed in Las Vegas.",1

Scott was really nice and everything but as I was getting my nails done, I notice a couple of my nails looked crooked and lopsided, so I asked him to fix them and he did, as I'm looking at my nails I notice that he had taken too much off the sides on a couple of my nails which made them look like they were leaning to left and told him and he said ""I just shaped them"" and I'm showing him how it looks like my nail is lop sided, and he kept saying the he just shaped them, so I just let him continue because I felt like he obviously wasn't listening to what I was saying or showing him. The paint job was complete crap, they were bumpy, looked like they're smeared and I had to ask him several times to fix them, and he did seem somewhat irritated that I was asking him to redo the polish, working in the beauty industry myself, when my clients are coming to me and spending a good amount of money too look great, I'm not going to give them a crap job and if they ask my to fix something I'm not going to give the attitude or get irritated because they want something perfected to their liking, I'm going to give my clients their money's worth and a great experience.

11506,3,1548547200000,"As an NCP local, living walking distance from the Upward Projects, you could say I've been to Windsor a time or two. When I went to dinner last night with my family, I was reminded once again, why our neighborhood is so lucky to have Windsor. When we were seated, we were concerned our waiter was in a bad mood, slightly regretful we were seated in his section. It turned out he was just quiet with an incredibly dry (and hilarious) sense of humor, as he redeemed himself when my dad spilled an entire glass of red wine all over his pants. His quick interjections made the whole thing laughable. The incident suggested a change to white wine, as it is much more ""summery"" and he wouldn't run the risk of another pant-staining mishap. My parents wanted to order a bottle, which I was totally against, considering the fact that I've never ever found a white wine I liked and my mom's tastes veer toward the terribly sweet picks. Don't ask me how he did it, but he magically found a bottle all three of us enjoyed! 

When it came time to order, he accidentally rang up my dad's pot pie as the fish, apologizing like crazy when he realized his mistake. He proceeded to let us know he'd comp the pot pie and make it up to us. I mean, apologies were expected but considering his food came out not even five minutes late, the comp was totally unnecessary but greatly appreciated! When we received our check, our waiter brought out a large handful of coupons for free ice cream from Churn next door - a sweet way to end our delicious meal and enough ice cream to last a week. A night of superb service, mixed with witty banter from a surprisingly passionate waiter and phenomenal food made me fall in love with Windsor all over again!

However, the steaks are nothing special.  I had the ribeye, and my date had the filet.  Both were obviously quality cuts of meat, but just nothing that would set either apart from other steakhouses.

I did not appreciate the attitudes of the snooty staff and hostesses.  This place is over-the-top pretentious, which is to be expected, but I just felt like there was an ora that was disgusting.  In Vegas, I've enjoyed Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon which are other even higher-end restaurants.  There was a warm feeling with the service and I felt like their guest for a special treat.  At Prime, they made it feel as though I should be thankful to be served and seated in such a prim and proper, ""high"" class environment.  

Prime is trying to be something that it's not.  This restaurant is located 45 yards from a wheel of fortune slot.  There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.  We're not in Paris folks, we're in Las Vegas- king of the nobody doing his best to act like he's somebody, and paying the credit card price for month's to come (LV is my favorite city in America).

Finally, the $100 seafood appetizer platter was a complete waste.  The oysters were terrible (relative).  Prime needs to lose the attitude, and focus more on special food that matches the price.",2

11512,1,1546732800000,"Sales Representative (Former Employee), Tempe, AZ - April 21, 2017

""Modern Day Wolves on Mill Street""

This company is not only ripping off its Merchants with lies and deception they are doing the same with Employees, including discrimination. 

If you where a Merchant signed prior to March 2016 and bought or leased any Point of Sale System, I would question the legality of the Sale/Lease. Management at the Tempe office, used business tactics that could be considered illegal to say the least. Sending out Sales Reps and asking them just to get the contracts signed (highlighted signature boxes in meetings) and we fill in the blanks after,. As far as training to know the business, you where often told ""Dont worry about it"" ""Just get it done"" If you ask questions you where ridiculed and mocked, told you just need to shut up and do it the ""EMG Way"" 

To keep the consumer in the dark, the Sales Rep was instructed to have the equipment shipped to the Tempe office, and at that time another Sales Rep would be instructed to do whats called a ""Penny Transaction"" This would involve the other Sales Rep using the personal information of the Merchant (Social Security or EIN number), to pretend to be the Merchant to finalize the lease terms. Many times the terms where not discussed with the Merchant and often they where surprised when they received the bill a month later. At that time they would cancel the services but however could not cancel the lease and stuck with equipment. 

I was witness to all this as an employee who showed up an hour early, with energy and optimism. Only to be shot down on a daily basis. If you where a Minority, Male or Elderly with any values, you would not fit in. There is and has been wide spreed discrimination with this company. They use loopholes to cheat employees out of monthly bonuses, often changing the pay schedule to do so. As an Arizona Employee, you need to know they also use a loophole to avoid paying employees on a bi-weekly basis as required by law in Arizona, saying the corp offices are out of Texas. They have several cases with the EEOC Nationwide. I am shocked that they have not been investigated, or raided by now. 

Asking for help from the Corp offices is a lost cause.",2

The chefs antics were the same each time., and I agree with another reviewer, it really does seem as if each table is having a birthday. The place is very loud. Happy hour specials at the bar while waiting for the table weren't bad, $2 for a carafe of sake. 
I also agree the wait staff can very significantly. The first time we went it wasn't very busy. We were seated immediately. However at the end of the dinner we didn't get offered our tea or ice cream. The second time we went despite it being very busy, we got offered that but once my water ran out, I never got a refill.

This drink also contains one of those little yakult drinks, then it's just a ton of ice and like a cup of milk. Taste is like artificial mango. Ya not getting this specific drink again. My go-to for coco is usually the regular milk tea with pearls since you can't really go wrong with that (unless they mess up the tapioca or add too much water).

I'm glad we came here, though - this was one of the best brunch meals I've had since moving to Calgary. Cheap, it is not - I browsed a few reviews already of patrons complaining about the menu prices and affluence of the neighbourhood - but the food quality was definitely there! 

We sat on the patio at Dairy Lane and enjoyed prime people watching as we sipped on waters and made small talk before our server arrived to take our orders. As this was back in August, I can't quite remember what exactly I ordered, but it was delicious. The eggs were soft and light, but buttery - read: not oily - while the meat was a tad dry and unseasoned. My friend's Benny order was screwed up, but he decided to take the Omelette that they had made instead and really loved it!

The server was very friendly and accommodating, despite the order screw-up, but the service seemed a tad rushed for not even having a line out the door. Perhaps this place could benefit from having an extra server during brunch hours. The café is small and cozy, with a beautiful wood-themed patio, comfy seats and a relaxed, easygoing ambience. The clientele consisted of chatty urbanites and youthful couples. If you're in the neighbourhood, Dairy Lane is certainly worth stopping for!",2

My waiter was a little creepy. Just caught this weird vibe. He kept hovering and asking me if everything was ok and stuff. Used to people checking on me once after delivering food but not more than that. Perhaps because there were only 3 tables occupied he didn't know what else to do.

I give this place 4.5 because most of the times the baguettes get pretty hard. I've had it when the baguette was fresh, just came out and it was melt-in-your-mouth kind of crunchy.

As others have noted-- the regular menu is all over the map, which is frightening, but I've just stuck with the Sri Lankan curries which are good (but a bit on the salty side).  They also have quesadillas, so it checks the box for being a place that my pickier kid will eat at without too much protest.

The lunch buffet however was a surprise!  While I am not an expert on Sri Lankan food, there was a great variety (more than is on the regular menu) and it was actually appropriately SPICEY, unlike your typical Indian buffet.  They also had a couple of desserts-- again, different from Indian, but similar in that the overwhelming characteristic was sweet (which I actually like).  Our server said that they switch the dishes Fri/Sat/Sun from the rest of the week.  Lunch Buffet was a bargain @ $9.99, and I think weekends are $12.99.

11609,2,1546732800000,"I was in the mood to have a Banh Mi and it's been quite awhile since I ate here, probably 2-3 years.  It was a rainy day and it just seemed like the right type of food and to down it with a boba drink.

Thought about treating my mechanic and his helper and I thought my husband would like this.  And I know my kids already like this, and they were starting to eat solid food again from being sick the past week.

Ordered 3 grilled pork Banh Mi's, 2 grilled chicken and a roast beef croissant sandwich and 2 orders of 5 pork & shrimp egg rolls.  There was nobody ordering at the time we ordered and the lull of any lunch rush was over.

The Banh Mi's were very reasonably priced at $3.49 and it's quite a lot for a sandwich.  The egg rolls, I thought, were a little pricey at $3.99 for 5 Vietnamese style egg rolls (deep fried), but the sandwich price made up for this.  I can't remember how much the small croissant sandwich was, but I think that was close to $5 and it wasn't very big.

So the deal is to get a Banh Mi, but my son wasn't up to eating that much and needed something softer.  All that came to about $31-32, which that's food for 6 people's lunches, so not bad.

It took probably 15 minutes to make the order, which the egg rolls were already prepared, so I thought it took a bit more time.  I didn't know that the Banh Mi wrappers indicated what sandwich it was.

The guy that took my order is Latino, which isn't a big deal.  I think the guy making the stuff was Asian.  Oh, and make sure you bring cash.  They do not take credit or debit cards and there is a machine for you to get cash, but there is a $1.75 charge.  I wish they had this as a sign on the front door - CASH ONLY!  

Next time I will know.  That was why I gave it a 4 star, but really, it only deserves a 1/2 star knock down for that, not a full star.  But, since I'm Asian, I should know that some Asian places only do cash.  Okay, heck, I'll give them 5 stars.

We'd go again.  Everyone that I got the sandwiches for liked them.  The baguette was perfect - somewhat toasted on the outside and slightly soft on the inside.  The grilled pork was very tasty and just enough of the veggies, not too much.  Just the right amounts of meat and veggies.

My mechanic and his helper had the grilled chicken Banh Mi and they loved it.  The egg rolls were good.",1
11611,1,1546560000000,"Best sushi in Cleveland. Very fresh and very authentic for a Japanese sushi experience. Manager is nice, but service is awful slow. I used to eat here once, often twice a week when traveling weekly for a project. I had to stop coming because the service was so slow it took up too large of a chunk of my night. To some degree, I think this was due to preparing quality food, but too often I would see the waitress just chatting up guests and forget that other people were in the restaurant. On occasion, I have been served the wrong roll (salmon instead of the toro which I was still charged for), didn't receive my appetizers until almost done with sushi, and then never received my drink I ordered. The phone doesn't work in the evening so you can't order to-go either (even ordering in person at the restaurant for to-go takes a long time - might as well eat there if you're putting in the time to wait). 

But alas...despite all the unfortunate experiences I've had there, I still think this place deserves 4 stars. It's so fresh and delicious. Definitely the best fish you'll find in all of Ohio. I seriously debate Ginko or elsewhere for dinner whenever I'm in town for work. Unfortunately, Ginko keeps losing the battle. Although after writing this review and reminiscing about all the tasty memories I have there, I may just suck it up and make my way back.",2

11614,1,1548892800000,"I just dealt with these guys and had a great experience.  I found a car on Craigslist that they were advertising and through the entire process I was waiting for the typical tactics of a small car dealership.  I was waiting for the salesman (Mark, by the way) to get pushy, for them to bait and switch me on a piece of junk, for hard tactics by the finance manager... etc... I kept waiting and waiting, then before I knew it I had keys in my hand.

They all were extremely professional, swift, educated, courteous.  I cannot say enough good about them.  I actually commented to them as I was leaving that I expected a battle and was pleasantly surprised.

Now... I will say that while I was there I did see a few unhappy customers.  The ones I saw were all a part of their ""buy here, pay here"" program.  Frankly, and I am not pulling the Mitt Romney card, but if no one else will loan you money why make the life hell of someone who will?  There were an endless parade of people coming in and reading them the riot act because their car payment was due!  

The other review I read on this place is trying to nail The Car Company because the car was a POS.  All of these places operate the same way - they go to an auction and buy a product that they can make the most money on.  Most times they only have a car in their possession for less than a week.  It is not a sinister plot that car dealers devise to buy junk cars and dump them off on some poor bastard.

I dunno.... I could go on for days on entitlement and etc... but not the point of the review.  The Car Company treated me well and seem to be a solid company.  If they have another vehicle that I like, at a reasonable price, I would certianly buy from them (cash) again.",1

11667,3,1546905600000,"Thanksbeto BlogTO, I have found yet *another* stupendously delicious spot in which to gorge on brunch. 

The Harlem Underground is housed in the space occupied by the formerly named Irie. Despite having passed Irie about a billion times, it just never looked very inviting, so when I saw that they mixed things up a bit, I thought I'd give it a try. A new interior and a new menu has apparently done wonders for Harlem Underground. 

My interest was piqued when I saw that they served ""soul food"", which I also consider ""southern food"". Being from the American South, I miss what I consider ""home"" or ""comfort"" foods, which would include pretty much everything on the Harlem Underground menu. Their brunch includes such southern delights as Sweet Potato Waffles, Crawfish Etouffee, Frog Legs, and pecan-covered French Toast. I chose the Harlem Benny, which, despite its name, isn't your traditional eggs benedict. Rather, instead of english muffins, HU serves the perfectly cooked poached eggs over a thin sweet potato pancake that's covered with sausage and grits (!). A cheesy hollaindaise is served on the side for dipping or pouring. Also served on the plate was the most delicious side salad EVAR -- baby greens, pear, red and yellow peppers, and pomegranate seeds!

As per usual, I ordered a half order of the French Toast and asked them to surprise me with which one. They were more than accommodating and immediately said ""sure, we can do that -- is $2 fair?"".  

Overal;, the food was fabulous -- very well flavoured, temperature-appropriate, and plentiful. I had a latte with brunch and it was also very good. 

Service was exceptional -- friendly, attentive, and not overly ""in your face"". 

I took a glance at the dinner menu and it looked equally appealing. I will definitely go back to the Harlem Underground -- I just hope it's as good the second time around!

Note: there are two locations -- one on Richmond East and this one on Queen West.",2

The layout is really nice - you walk in past the MULTIPLE pool tables and the outdoor patio, which is also large.  The big wrap-around bar is towards the back where it looks into the kitchen.  I believe they have 5 or 6 dart boards with plenty of space/tables/seating for spectators.  

The service was a little slow when we first got there - looked like one guy was tending bar and running food.  A ""hey guys, be with you in a minute"" or even just a simple hello would've held me over.  I have a pet-peeve about not being greeted when you walk into a place like that.

We ordered the Greek salad and Bourbon burger with cottage cheese.  Both plates looked great and had nice portions.  I appreciated that the vinaigrette wasn't too sweet, a lot of places will add sugar.  The burger was cooked perfectly and had nice toppings.  We decided to play some darts while we waited for our food and the bartender actually brought the food, utensils and condiments directly to us which was nice.  He refilled our drinks quickly too, even though we weren't at the bar anymore.

A week or so later a lady called and set an appointment with the Landscape person since we already had a pool. Our appointment time came and went, Tonyv the salesperson was a no show. When I called him, he said I was mistaken the appointment was the following night. I assured him I was the one who picked the date and he proceeded to tell me the receptionist who booked the appointment was no longer with them.....ok, no problem. I rescheduled a few days later and Tony came out. I told him we had a couple other contractors bidding on our project and he tells me Brandenburg charges a fee of 100, maybe 150 dollars to draw something up, you know to cover the time. I thought that was reasonable so I said no problem. The following week he asks for $480 to get started, you know for the time involved. When I reminded him he said it may be up to $150 he tells me again I was mistaken and misunderstood. 
I later called to reach out to Tony to get his thoughts on what he would do with our yard but after mentioning I had 3 other bids for the project he said he wasn't use to people getting that many bids and it was unusual if I had to contact that many contractors. I should be able to make up my mind with one or two. Ok.......
It's unfortunate Tony wasn't interested in bidding a $80,000 backyard project. Although not a huge project, it's certainly not something you want to dismiss due to competition. We were looking for quality over quantity and thought Brandenburg could provide something more. Truly a disappointing experience.",2

The salad, SALTY. The pasta sauces, SALTY. The dressings, SALTY. Soup: SALTY.

Nothing worth mentioning, we tried several items and were disappointed, But we had breadsticks, so why worry?

11715,2,1547510400000,"So because we were staying at Monte Carlo, for our Anniversary dinner, we decided to try out this restaurant. I searched on Yelp for a nice restaurant, and this one happened to come up as closest (obviously, since it was inside Monte Carlo) with 3 money signs. Plus it said it was romantic. 

So we made reservations and headed on down there. First of all, the hostess was not friendly. She asked for my last name and when I told her, she replied ""what??"" instead of ""excuse me"" or something similar.. And then when she located my reservation, she said ""ah"" with no further instructions. And as I looked around, she finally said that another hostess was coming up to escort us to our table. (awkward of her to make us momentarily confused).

Then we get to the table.. The restaurant is literally right next to the tables at the casino so it's pretty loud.. (specially when some Las Vegas Virgin is overhyped and keeps yelling VEEEGAAAAAASSSS every time he wins a hand.. Uff) So it's not quite romantic.. 

Then the service was ok.. I felt rushed by the server. He seemed rushed as well too. We ordered the calamari, my boyfriend ordered the filet mignon, and I ordered the Chilean sea bass.

Calamari - was amazing. Probably the best calamari I've had in a long while. They were fried to perfection

Filet mignon - was amazing as well and I don't even like steak! HOWEVER, the steak came with NOTHING. It as just 2 bits of steak on a plate plus 2 different sauces and that was it. Um!? Usually, at a steakhouse, steak is served with at least a side of veggies or fries.. or SOMETHING. NO. Here, it came with nada! WHY!? Idk. But fine, if the steak comes with no sides, I would expect the server to inform us ""the steak does not come with any sides. Would you like to order any sides such as fries, baked potatoes, or etc?"" But no. He didn't say anything. 

Chilean Sea Bass - was amazing. It came with lemon risotto. Cooked to perfection. I finished the entire plate way too quick!! Excellent. 

We didn't order any dessert here so I can't comment on that. 

All in all for the above items plus a beer and a glass of wine, the total came up $130 + tip. For that price, I wish the server was more attentive to us and MAYBE told us about the sides situation for the steaks. ""/ Also, as mentioned above it was pretty loud.. Not a good place if you want a quiet dinner with conversations. Also, the wait time between taking the order.. and getting our appetizer.. and then finally getting our entrees was quite long...

The hotel is terrible.  We usually stay at the D, but they were sold out on 2 days of our stay so we decided to try the plaza.  I made reservations 2 months in advance for a king deluxe room with Fremont street view.  When we arrived we get a 2 queen bed with a view of the parking lot.  Go back down to the desk, and guess what?!?!?  They don't have our requested room available.  We get a king bed this time with a fancy view of the parking lot.  

The room was disgusting as well.  Tiny bathroom, a sink that would not drain in under 30 minutes and smelled like a rotten egg/sulfur mix.  Paint was missing from the walls, the doors squeaked and at 6 in the morning you thought someone was entering your room because the walls are paper thin.  The door didn't have a good deadbolt lock. The TV didn't work and neither did the ice machine.  The air conditioner had a musky smell to it when turned on, I'll be surprised if I don't end up with legionnaires disease in a few days from it.  They wanted to charge me $20 a day for 7 days for a refrigerator that I needed for my medication Not wanting to spend the $140 for a mini fridge, I went to the ABC store and bought a foam cooler and used other floors ice machines.  Which brings me to the elevators, they are practically death traps.  The floor read outs  don't work, they constantly bang and won't open.  

Over all this place is nasty and I will never be back.  Upon checkout I was asked how my stay was.  I said terrible.  They employee said, ""Well that's good"". Just goes to show you, they don't listen and it seems like they are encouraged to make your stay a living hell.",1

The flavor is still very good though. The Lo Mein is quite good as well. The fried spring rolls that come with the lunch specials leave a little bit to be desired.

Each dish order comes with either Russian Borsche/Cream Soup with dinner rolls. Bread is rarely served these days so it was a pleasant surprise! Also there is a tea to drink (the lemon tea is really bitter) as well as dessert (lychee jelly with condensed milk)

 Linguini Bolognese (~$8) - i like how they changed it up from spaghetti. Generous portion of cheddar.

I was staying next store to Wendy's so walked over for a quick bite for lunch.  It was about 1:30 pm on Sat so I wasn't expecting a large lunch crowd but there it was, a line of about 15 people.  No problem, I had time to wait.  And wait I did. For a very long time.

It seemed one of the 2 guys working the counter was working in slow motion while the other was trying to hustle & get meals out.  I have never been to a Wendy's this slow. 

Eventually I got my salad & was on my way.  My mozz & chicken salad was good, however it came with some kind of mustard dressing on it.  I always get their salads & they give you a packet of dressing on the side; I wondered why they would put dressing on it as well.

Later in the day before hitting the road again we stopped for dinner.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich & my friend ordered a burger & fries.  Again, the wait was excruciating!  We waited half an hour for our order; not so fast fast food!  My sandwich came out on a grain roll that tasted like it was a week old.  The entire thing looked & tasted old.  My friend's fries had also obviously sitting around for quite some time.  He just dumped them.  Had we not been on the road when we started eating we would have returned the food.  It was that bad.

I DO NOT recommend this particular Wendy's & I sincerely think corporate should check & see what the problem is there.  I'm sure the only reason they are still in business is because of the theme park & hotel across the street.",3

I'm vegetarian but I avoid large amounts of dairy and eggs and any other animal product (although I'm not actually vegan).  It's really nice to go to a restaurant and not have to worry about picking through ""oh does this have meat hidden it it"".  In a typical restaurant, the only non-meat items are ridiculously cheesy pasta which I won't eat either.  It also has a lot of gluten free options which are great for people who don't eat gluten!  Amazing how they can do that.

First time I went, I had the Lucky ChowMein and my boyfriend had the Pad Thai.  Both were delicious.  I had so much left over that I took about half home ... I added some more veggies and tofu to it at home and made it into two more lunches!!  Second time I went, I had the Shanghai Noodle and my boyfriend had the Thai Curry.  The curry was a bit spicy for me.  The Shangai Noodle was very good as well.  It had a ""spicy"" label on it but it was NOT spicy at all so I'm not sure why it had that label.  It had flavour yes, but it wasn't spicy.  We also got the spring rolls appetizer both times which is delicious.  Another thing is that I've never gone to any place that makes tofu even close to how we make it at home.  It's usually plain and boring.  However, the Loving Hut makes pretty good tofu!!

My favourite was the Lucky ChowMein.  I'd like to try the tofu appetizer and one of their burgers sometime.  I'd also like to try the dessert sometime.  I definitely plan to go back.

11758,3,1548547200000,"they turned me into collections for a debt that no one except their book keeper seems to be able to find...much less was passed onto me. when I asked about it I was told that she had emailed the collections company to tell them to take me out,as the debt was paid. 

 when I asked why I hadn't been notified as id been there 2ce to pick up packages, and was told that chandler didn't know about the bill as she is not the book keeper....and that I didn't leave a forward address. I told her that they had my number as this was how chandler contacted me both times, and that none of my bills seemed to have trouble getting to me, so where was my copy of this,as it should of been rerouted via the post office to my new address as was everything else..


 she told me I was being difficult as this was my fault that she didn't have a address to mail it to,but to never mind as the bill was taken care of by my mortgage company,,, which is weird as she told my mortgage company that there had been an outstanding bill but it was taken care of..and thaere was nothing further owed..

 my impression is she got caught in a lie, as neither I or my mortgage company have paid the bill,and yet she sent it to collections after she spoke with the mortgage company, but when I called her to find out what was going on she told me that the bill was paid and she d emailed the company that am to tell them to take me out of collections as the bill was paid in full.-which is also very perplexing to me as they had gotten so far in their process as to start calling and harassing me, so why would this be if the bill was paid in full???
   so be extremely careful and don't trust anything they say as they will tell you and your representatives there is no outstanding debt, and then turn you into collections for something they cannot prove and their staff know nothing about---it seems odd to me that neither of the office girls knew of this debt, would seem to me that when they contacted me they would be aware of any outstanding debt, but that's just me....

horrible terrible rude staff,would not deal with this company again ever",2
11762,3,1548720000000,"The Ritz may be a 5-star hotel, but DEQ is not the place to go for a 5-star high tea experience.

There was a nice selection of teas, and the food was good. Quite good, but nothing I was really impressed by. My favourite part was actually the passionfruit cake that was provided as a birthday treat. The coldness of the cake added a refreshing texture that made it taste just perfect. I would go again for that cake, but the food in the high tea set was only average good.

The service was what left me unsatisfied. The servers were polite, but we had slight troubles grabbing their attention. A spoon was not provided to eat the panna cotta, and we were told to use the same spoon we used to stir our tea. It wasn't a problem but I found it strange, especially for such a nice place. Here's my biggest irk, and the reason I'm taking away a star. We asked to have our leftovers packed up, and we were given only a takeout box. For some reason, other customers were given fancy bags for their leftovers. We weren't even given a plastic bag, and left awkwardly holding onto a takeout box. I guess we could have asked for a bag, but we didn't want to bother trying to get a server's attention for something that should be standard. 

In short, food was good but there are better options for a better price. Service needs improvement. And say it's your birthday so you get a nice cake.",2

Then another bartender talks to Jackie about where to move us, and Jackie LIES and says she didn't tell us we could move. WTF? We aren't making it up. 
-We are then told we have to move and our option is to go back outside, or we can sit across from each other in the middle of someone else's table. Seriously?

Our dog had a growth in her mouth which we became concerned and asked our neighbor for a vet recommendation and he highly suggested West Hill Animal Clinic. Though it is a bit of a drive we could not be happier with the clinic and our doctor, Dr. Greenway. Being a New Yorker I expect the best service and I sure received it at West Hill. The clinic is very clean, organized, secretaries are very well spoken and know your appointment before you even walk in through the door. Our dog had appointments before the surgery for blood work, which the Dr. followed up once the results were in, and when the surgery was performed our doctor sent us pictures of the surgery and the mass that was removed, which was followed by a phone call explaining every detail of the work done. After the surgery our Dr. called us to make sure that our dog was doing well. Every appointment with our doctor has been very informative and makes you trust that your dog is in good hands. Another reason why we are thrilled about this clinic is the cost of care. Again things in NY are very expensive when it comes to animal care and West Hill is very reasonable for the service you get.

I will recommend this animal clinic to anyone who loves their pet as much as we do.",2

Let me start with at least one positive.  Kelly, behind the bar, is awesome.  She's friendly and knows her stuff.  And that, my fellow yelpers, is where the redeeming qualities end.

Rarely have I been where the waitstaff was so clueless and uncaring.  ""May I see a wine list?"".. ""Oh, uhh.. well, we don't really have one right now... sorry.""  *crickets*  Are you kidding me?  if I had been here once and heard this, I probably wouldn't mention it, but over a 3-4 month period, I heard this more than once.  My other major complaint is that many of the servers are just rude.  I'll grant, however, that if I had to put up with the usual crowd they draw, I may be, too.  

After visiting this place on a Saturday night, I knew it'd be my last visit.  The back patio was WAY overcrowded and packed with self-absorbed douches.  Rudeness gets elevated almost to an art form back there.  Beware, they also allow smoking back there.  Just.. eww!  As we were trying to leave, I had people actually refuse to move so that I could step down off the patio.  Seriously??  Why are there bouncers here?  All they did was watch as I struggled to navigate the insanity.

Skip this drunk and douche infested place and walk across the street to Ten Park Lanes, instead.  You deserve better.",2

I called again and Justin was somewhat dismissive of this lack of communication and offered to set us up with a new appointment, but again

Cannot imagine what their service looks like after one signs a 3-yr contact with them!

I'm disappointed with the lack of communication and customer service at Skytec Security.

11835,2,1547942400000,"Went for dinner on a Saturday at 8:30 pm - been to the downtown location once and decided to try this location for my birthday dinner with my family. 

Great atmosphere, but for those who had been to the downtown location this might be a little disappointing in comparison. A little crammed and only one floor versus the two floors in downtown. The dance performance was enjoyable, however again I prefer the one downtown one with the mini aerial acrobatic performance. We were served steak by 2 different servers throughout the night. 

The steak here is delicious for those who are not sticklers about the cook on the steak. Some slices were medium-rare, most were medium, and a few would come well done depending on how thick the slices were. My two favourites were the parmesan filet mignon and salmon. Chimichurri skirt steak was my third favourite, but that's only because the cut of beef isn't my preference however the flavour was fantastic. For those who are sensitive to salt, you might find the parmesan-crusted one a little salty, so ask for a thicker cut to offset the saltiness. 

The variety of the buffet was underwhelming and the same can be said about the variety of meats. There was much more variety in the downtown location including shrimp which they did not have at this Eglinton location. This location is also cheaper by $10 so that could be why.  

Overall Copacabana is an amazing restaurant for meat lovers who value a multitude of steak flavours and aren't bothered by inconsistencies in steak doneness. The atmosphere and service is excellent. For the full experience I would highly suggest the downtown location over the Eglington one.",2

Got the Italian combo Mike's way which included oregano, oil & vinegar, shredded lettuce, tomatoes, etc.  All cold cuts were cut at the moment of preparation which means that all were super fresh.  I had a choice of white or wheat bread (not whole wheat) which was a darker version of the white.  I don't think that the servers know that white bread is still wheat bread... I digress.  
Ate the sandwich home and thought the sandwich was amazing.  I like the fact that the bread was not that thick--more cold cuts than bread and that there was a nice crunch with the added veggies.  At my request they added hot cherry peppers and they did deliver a hot punch which I enjoyed.  Speedy service too!  
I was a fan of a sandwich place that begins with a C but I think Jersey Mike's won me over.

11935,2,1546905600000,"Once upon a time, I would bring everyone I knew to this restaruant for a fun-time and good brunch. Now, I never suggest it and refuse to step foot in again. 

The atmosphere is sort of fun-loving with a cute minibar at the front of the restaurant and seating arrangements spanning from patio, main floor and second floor. 

The service is almost non-existant...You have a server appear once and then never again. You are perched or famished or something but no one is in sight...You can hear staff laughter or see them sipping on a beverage while you try to control your own thirst for water or coffee or tea. If you have a table to wait on, why are you not doing so? Of course, I am not suggesting to constantly be on the lookout for what to do for your customers but some semblance of thoughtfulness of bringing over the menu or a glass of water really goes a long way!

The food is inedible. My go to was always the Blueberry Hill. However...Once it was slightly burned which I excused and simply ate. The second time was completely burned. Each pancake was covered in burnt pieces of dough...There was an attempt to conceal it with more blueberry compote but failed miserably. I had asked to replace it and was denied. This ties back to the notion that customers are not the priority here but rather maintaining a relaxed attitude is. Again all we diners ask is that our food is cooked well (or even decently or maybe even considered edible) because we pay for your services and your food. You hurt your customer's trust in your product by displaying certain things and frankly, this is not my recommended anything anymore.",2

3 - Service - was good. We called for water and it was brought up immediately (within 3 minutes! really!). When we checked out - we noticed we were charged for internet access. (When we made reservations we were told it would be free). This was corrected. (THANKS HILTON).

My favorite is the chilli fries with fresh onions , those are a must every time we come here along with zucchinis.  We just had their sandwich (hearty farmers club ) it's really good.  I'm so in love with their ranch but it's sad that every time I have to ask for one extra ranch , the container they give you is almost empty     I almost need like 4",2

The inside is decorated nicely with balloons and other party type decor. They had a cool Carolina Panthers display. I love a place that shows local pride! There were a few people in front of me in line at 2 PMish on a Saturday. They had 2 registers open and both were moving fast. I told the really nice employee it was my first time there and my birthday and I got a free Bundlet! That was unexpected! I also purchased 2 Bundlets for a total of 3. The little bundt cakes are the size of a large muffin, very moist, and rich but not overly so. This place was worth the drive and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet treat! Oh and the employees were both very nice and informative to every customer and didn't rush me when I didn't know what to get!",2

I've had it done the waxing way a few times at random Asian nail salons over the years. I feel like they end up making it look too done (penciled in kinda vibe) So for us guys that check the asian/middle eastern box(or just trying to keep it clean) but dont want it to look obvious this is the spot to go. Julie is the one that has done it for me two times I've been and its been great. Plan on about 10 minutes if for the whole process if there is no wait. She is very thorough and makes it look clean.

The waiter took a long time to take our order. Then, it was long waiting before we got the food. We asked if the server can help us check if our dishes were coming. The server did not even apologize but had a huge attitude, saying that ""you see that we do have an entire restaurant inside to hold""(we were sitting at the patio). When we finally got the tiny plates of food, the waiter forgot who ordered  what. For the entire period of time, the waiter disappeared and did not refill the water.  Lastly, the bill. The server took our cards but charged 15 dollars more on each card. When we asked, he said that he did it wrong but no apology again. 

Overall, a over-rated place. Don't think I will ever come back again, as there are way better choice in vegas.",2

There is free wifi available, and they often play music or a tv show/movie on you tube which is a nice distraction from the typical buzzing of nail drills in other salons.

I come in for bi-weekly acrylic overlay on my nails ($15 full set and even cheaper for just a fill).  They are the only nail salon that has been able to do the exact narrow coffin shape and length I ask for and I am always leaving happy.

I do wish there was more of a nail polish colour selection, and that the polish wall was a bit more organized so it would be easier to select a colour, however they do offer a free shellac on hands when you get a mani & pedi.  They also have a loyalty program card so after 5 visits your 6th is $5 off.",2
11996,1,1547251200000,"We came here for summerlicious. The apps were the best part of our meal- crab cake and calamari. Both delicious. My dining companion had the lobster ravioli and I had the salmon. The salmon was a little over done. The ravioli was good. The trio of desserts were meh.

At some point I ended up with a bug in my wine glass. As soon as the waiter saw it, he got me a new glass, poured me a fresh glass of wine from the bottle and apologized for the incident.

If you are not in a rush and want to go to a place where you can hear your date talk, this is a good place to go. The restaurant was at half capacity, and we found the pacing and service just right.",1

While waiting, we opened our napkins to set the cutlery.   This is the part that grossed me out, the cutlery was obviously not cleaned as there was dried gunk on it.  I grabbed one from the table next to us, no gunk but had this greasy feeling to the touch.   I called the waitress over and let her know the cutlery was not cleaned properly.   So she grabs another set next to our table.  I asked her to open it and inspect it.... of course it had a greasy film to it.   She goes back to the kitchen to get me a clean clean set of cutlery, the manager comes back bringing the cutlery and apologizes.   As a goodwill gesture he says we can have a free appetizer.

Of course the internal alarm bells go off.  I now take a closer at a bread plate, mine was fine but the person next to me felt it was ""Greasy"".  

Nachos came, I ate the top part and left a layer of nachos so I would not have to eat any part that was touching the plate. 

I don't plan to visit a Moxies again.",2

They don't do reservations, so expect a wait. It's a bit more cozier than Houston's with lots of u shape booths and same dimly lit environment. 

The artichoke appetizer was not in season and got their cornbread skillet as an app instead. It was real satisfying. Wildfire offers it complimentary though. Don't know if there are Wildfire in AZ. 

Their prime rib was so good and same with their filet. Rotisserie chicken was really good from what my friend said. 

The service was very warm and friendly.  It's not too loud do you can carry on conversations with your friends.

12007,3,1548028800000,"I've gone to this spa for probably about 5 years now.  I'll likely continue to go, unless something near it at least as nice opens.  I like the online scheduling and several of the service professionals are quite good.  It's expensive, but considering it's an Aspinwall/Fox Chapel spa, it's to be expected I think.  I've been in more refined spas with better changing areas (as noted by someone else in a different review), but it has a certain charm and is kept clean.  I do think they should improve communication, especially around the Buy One Get One Special they run near the holidays.

To save someone else, know that their BOGO allows you to spend whatever dollar amount you want to purchase a gift card, and you'll get the same amount for free on the another card.  What wasn't explained to me before purchasing is that you need to use the card labeled BOGO (specifically) before April Fool's Day.  Also, you can only use the BOGO on one service.  That means if you get a pedicure and massage, you'll only be able to apply the BOGO to one.  That also means if you get a cut and color in the salon, you can only use the BOGO to one.  You also cannot use your gift card (the one with the money you already used to purchase the card at the same time of your BOGO.  Therefore if you want to take advantage of the BOGO, be prepared to make multiple separate appointments for single services.  And some appointments may take a couple weeks to fit in, which I guess means that overall the services are good.  Oh, and you can't use your BOGO on Monday or Sunday.  The front desk informed me all of this is spelled out on the back of the BOGO.  Just wish someone would have told me verbally when I was handing over cash to purchase the card with the small print on the back. I know, Caveat Emptor.  

One other thing I'll kvetch about...one of my services said they weren't supposed to answer questions about this and are told to direct people to the front desk.  If it's too much of a liability to have wrong information given to customers by employees, chances are your system is TOO complicated.

As a tip to those not familiar with Aspinwall, this area has old time parking meters.  You'll need quarters, and can only purchase up to 2 hours.  If you ask, the spa will send someone out with your quarters if you need a refresh because you're still in service.",1

It's been over a month since getting my new home and I have yet to get keys to my mailbox for which they say takes 7-10 days. Initially we were told 7-10 weeks and after speaking with a supervisor who informed us the former counter person was incorrect and that they were processing our order only to come in 2 weeks later and they knew of no such key placement order request causing us to put in yet another order and wait another 7-10 days. If that's not the kicker, upon putting in a key request you fill out a mail hold request and are told your mail is available for pickup for the next 30 days yet every time I stop by this crazy place and stand in line for an hour or more they say they don't have mail for me! So I find myself staking out my mailman a few times out the week just to beg him for my mail. Should I catch him on a BAD day, well let's just say I not only don't get my mail, but I also get yelled at for even asking such a thing! As if that is bad even BEFORE they open their phone line goes busy and is busy ALL DAY until they close. You can't get a hold of this office via phone even if you tried.

I met a friend there and since it was HH we decided to start off with a pitcher of beer.  I swear this was the largest pitcher I have ever ordered and it was a good thing I had someone who would have a glass with me.  But there was no way we could finish the last of it.  There was probably another 16 oz glass left.
We started off with an appetizer.  Best bruschetta I ever have had.  There had to be at least 2 inches of diced tomatoes on the top just perfectly seasoned.  It would be a great appetizer for 4 people or just enough for 2 without ordering anything else.
We ordered a small pizza which would really feed 3 or 4 people.  It was a deep dish with fresh mushrooms and pepperoni. There were 6 extra large slices in this pie.  We each ended up taking home 2 pieces each.  Now I have 2 more delicious meals.
I would really recommend just one or 2 extra toppings so that you get the taste of pizza rather than the toppings.
The only reason I did not give it 5 starts was the atmosphere.  I remember the location in Chicago and the atmosphere inside which felt completely different here.
Since I am on the East Side of Phoenix I will try the PV location next and see if it is closer to what I remember from the Chicago location

We had to wait 45 minutes to be seated, I have no problem because they have a bar with some great beer choices at reasonable prices. What I did have a problem with was that they use a computer based system that will text you what your wait time is once you arrive and give them your telephone number. I waited exactly 45 minutes until I received a text that my table was ready. Not 40 or 50 minutes but exactly 45 minutes which is what I was told by the waitstaff upon arrival. I find that interesting, is it a scam to get you to go to the bar and spend more? Something to think about. The few wines they offer(2) they will pour a generous $6 glass.

Once we were seated at one of their high top tables. We were sweating our tails off because they had the garage door entrance to the patio area wide open. It is 95 degrees out and if I wanted to dine outside I would have asked to be seated in the patio area or stayed home and grilled my own burger. The burger was A-OK for this reason, way overcooked. Was by no means moist or juicy. It did have overall good flavor but, to have a truly awesome burger int needs to be both seasoned properly and also show that some skill and care was taken to actually heat that hunk of meat to perfection. The ingredients burgatory have are obviously top notch but honestly what's the point if you cant cook the the meat properly. 

Service at Burgatory was very quick and my order accuracy outside of the burger being overcooked was right on.  Will I make the trek back out to Burgatory? Probably not but I will stop by if I'm in the area and there isn't a wait.",2

This place is in a plaza and it's hard to find since the sign is mainly in Korean.  There's free parking in the plaza but very limited.  If you can't find parking you have to resort to street meter parking.  They don't take reservations here and the wait can range from 15 mins to 1 hour long.  I would recommend when you're 15 mins away call them and leave your phone number to hold a place in line. They really do call you back when your table is ready.  If you have a party of 2 it's easier to get a table fast.  As you can see from the pictures the place is tiny.  The ventilation system is not that great so you'll leave smelling like you were at a Korean bbq place!  They have there cute barrel stools that you sit on but also forms as a jacket and purse storage. You can put all you stuff in the barrel then put the cushion lid back on and voila you have a stool!  They give you amazing appetizers.  You get the shredded green onion salad which you put the spicy sauce on but you can use it for your lettuce wrap.  It also comes with Kim chi, spicy radish and sour jalapeño peppers with onions.  The meal also comes with a pot of steamed whipped eggs and Kim chi soup.  We ordered an extra vegetarian Bi bim boo, stone pot rice.  For our meat we ordered the steak skirt and pork belly.  The meat quality was great and lean.  There was a lot of food for the two of us. So stuffed at the end. The service is amazing.  No matter how busy the servers were they would always get you what you needed really fast when you ask for side dish and lettuce wrap refills.  This place is authentic and amazing.  It my 4th time here but it won't be my last.  I highly recommend this place if you're craving for Korean BBQ. It's not the cheapest place but for the quality and the amount of food you get I say it's well worth it. We didn't drink alcohol and our bill came to $70 for the two of us including tax and tips.",2

I was given an offer on 3/4 with the word ""Grant"" on it.  We did our due diligence to make sure this ""grant"" was funded and that the buyers met the criteria.  We were assured time and time again that my buyers were qualified and their loan was ready to go.  My home was to close on 4/5.  They were aware of this and okayed that date.  We pushed it back to 4/10.  That gave them an extra 5 days to get their crap together.

We are now on 4/12 and this supposedly funded grant no longer has funding and their loan officer keeps saying he is spending ""all day"" working on it.  He is not giving their realtor, my realtor, or myself any answers.  He left the office before 5 today - after supposedly going over to the grant office yesterday to get some magical piece of paper.

Instead of telling me we weren't' going to close on time he allowed me to move out of my home, put down earnest money (which I will now lose) on another house, turn off my utilities, and sign myself up for an interim 50-mile each way commute plus living with family in a tiny house and four dogs!

Unethical, untrustworthy, and I have zero faith they are going to close this loan.

Also, no one ever answers the phone - main line or otherwise.

So I actually searched for snow cones (shaved ice) in Las Vegas and came across Snow Vegas. Not only are they close, but it is probably the best snow cone I've ever had. Since finding them, I have stopped by at least one a week, if not more. The flavor actually stays and doesn't all go to the bottom like most do. Although I get the same flavor every time, don't worry they have over 30 flavors to pick from and you can't go wrong! And last but not least, I have to give a shout out to everyone who works there. I have always received great customer service and always look forward to going back!",1

I love how they went the extra mile to make me feel like I am in Japan, with the decorations, Japanese traditional style tables, and of course the food! 

I always get one of each roll, and this place being a steak spouse I got the Kobe beef. It is evident from the food that they take pride in what they cook, how they serve it, and in the over all satisfaction of the customer. The rolls were superb, I got the spicy tune and salmon, the California, the vegetables tempura, and shrimp tempura. The dishes came out in a timely manner. The main course was exquite, cook to ultimate perfection and served on an iron skillet - which I really did not care for but the beef was good.

12131,3,1548892800000,"Monkey Pants, The Pants, M Pizzy... Call it what you will, but Monkey Pants is and will always be one of my favorite bars in Tempe. I love this place because it's a bar that reminds its customers that they can let loose and not take themselves so seriously. Customers are also kindly reminded that they can receive a free shot just for showing off a little skin during the 1 o'clock shirtless shot! It's nonsense like this that made me a regular here, and it's nonsense like this that will always encourage me to bring my friends here for a good time.

The Pants isn't all about wackiness though, they take a few things seriously, like their food. A lot of the menu is typical bar fare, but there are a few things that stand out. In an attempt to cater to the influx of new-to-town transplants, they have burgers named by their state of influence. I definitely nod in the direction of the New Mexico, the Arizona and the Georgia burgers. They are all amazing, and if you're feeling silly, go for the Alaskan burger...that's sure to make your server (or Chris the bartender) chuckle. Next up, The Pants' ranch. They seriously need to bottle that and sell it. That ranch is the tastiest that I've ever had, and when paired with the fries, it's what the French would call, ""Bueno!"" ...or something like that. The ranch can also be paired with some pretty delicious hot wings as well. If you decide to go with those, get them charred on the grill with extra sauce!

In my opinion, any night is a good night for M Pizzy. But, if I had to choose a couple to recommend, they would be Wednesday for Wig Wednesday (happy hour prices from 8pm until close if you wear a wig...which are provided...and $2 off burgers) and Thursday ($5 hot dog special, live comedy and goldfish races after 10pm).

Honestly, after eating there once, I wouldn't have cared if it was in the middle of Homewood, open only in the middle of the night, the pastries were amazing! An added bonus was that their coffee was also delectable. 

Twice in our visit to Pittsburgh we visited, both times with rather large pastry orders, to try and sample the widest variety of pastries possible. I don't really have a sweet tooth, but I have a soft spot for well-made pastry and this place hit the nail on the head. I haven't been to France, so I cannot attest to it's authenticity, but it is the sort of stuff I dream of visiting if I were to ever go to France. 

All of their prices were extremely reasonable, especially given that their goods are baked fresh daily--I was a little shocked actually, at how cheap they were. While I didn't purchase any, their prices on whole cakes and pastries to take home were also extremely reasonable. The service was quick, efficient and pleasant. All of the pastries were not overly sweet, nor did they give you the sort of sugar shock you associate with cheap pastries. (I also purchased a giant box of pastries before leaving town and they traveled remarkably well in the car for eight hours, not getting soggy or melting.)

The chocolate eclair, lemon tart, raspberry tart, croissant, almond filled croissant, chocolate filled croissant, chouquette and cinnamon roll were all to die for delicious. The only pastry I had that I wasn't overly excited about was the raisin pastry, but it was just a little dry and I'm not overly fond of raisins. 

You must, must, must visit if you are in the market for high quality pastries.",2

Decor of the bar is similar with the old one. You know you are at Brew Tea when you walk in. The seating area is much bigger so it feels brighter too. 

My Jasmine Latte, half sweet with boba and pudding was delicious as usual. Boba was fresh, sweetness level and the fragrant jasmine tea was also perfect.

It was painfully all right.  No green waffles, no chuoi nep nuong, no assorted treats layed out just so.  Not a young coconut in site.  They did have the fresh squeezed sugarcane juice I have come to love.  But it still has nothing on Nuoc Mia Ninh Kieu's sugarcane and kumquat explosion.

Registers were fully occupied and by the time we got up towards the front they did have an associate come out to help assist customers by taking off sensor tags, asking if people needed backpacks ( which was us) & if anyone else needed gift cards. We had put a backpack ""on hold"" prior to coming in, so the associate was able to grab that for us and it made the process a lot quicker. Plus it was great customer service.

First of all, I live right across the street, so it's very convenient. I've been to Mojo and Yogurtini many times, and I think that Yogurtland wins hands-down. 

First, their yogurt flavors are so unique. They are always switching it up - my favorites are the Red Velvet Cake, Pistachio, and...drumroll please....Chocolate Coconut Truffle! YUM!  

Then, you have their extensive topping bar. They have more fresh fruit options than nearly any other place I've been...including Kiwi, Blackberries, Strawberries, and even Lychee fruit! I've never seen Lychee anywhere else. You can tell the fruit is freshly cut; not from a can, like at some other places *cough*yogurtini*cough*

Besides the fruit, they have pretty much everything else you could ever want; oreos, reeses, heath bar, butterfinger, all kinds of nuts, even those circus animal cookies! Like the yogurt, the toppings change daily (and I'm sure seasonally as well, especially the fruit), but I am always able to find something I love. 

Their yogurt is rich and creamy; hard to believe that many flavors are fat-free!  If you're in the area, it's DEFINITELY worth a try.",2

The outdoor patio is nice too but during a recent visit here a group of friends filled up one section of the patio and had bad service (I think the waitress was new as well) ... and to make it worse, when the last of our food was delivered (1.5 hrs after it was ordered) the waiter delivering it had the gawl to start arguing with us about the actual time we arrived there and ordered and then mummbled on about how our group was too big for that area... bad move on his part. Another waitress came out later who was very nice and cheery and she tried to remedy the situation but we already felt burned... A large part of our group WERE regulars but I can see that changing after this recent experience.

So I would still reccomend this place but keep the groups on the smaller side and stay indoors if you want good service. The owner has talked to our group while we've been there a couple of times and he seems nice and he means well...he can't control everything that happens there...perhaps the staff just needs more experience.",2

The reception area and pool are very well done, in typical Kimpton fashion. The rooms are nice, however could use more work. The bathrooms are completely remodeled, but the little amenities that I'm use to like the Ipod docking station, flat screen tv, cordless phone, room service past 11pm and multiple outlets (i'm an electronics junkie) just aren't there. The room really feels like any other average hotel. 

The spa was lovely, but it is not a full spa. I was hoping to sit in the steam room before my 90min massage, but unfortunately there wasn't one to sit in. The massage room was nice and the largest I had ever been in. It had it's own private bath/changing room and a large copper tub close to the actual massage table. I was pretty bummed I didn't add a bath to my massage.

The restaurant was not busy, with three or four tables occupied. I ordered the lemongrass chicken, and forgot that I normally have them add broccoli.

Yes, some items are more expensive that what you would find at a big box, the way I see it, its Peters Township, and its close, I dont have to drive to GE and contend with the Walmart traffic. 

As others have said their Hot Food bar is very good and its great for me to take food into work, salad bar is very good as well as is their soup bar.

There isnt to much bad that can be said about this place, if you look at the negative reviews these people are all from out of town.  Those of us who live near the place like it.",1

12341,2,1546732800000,"Shell has been my preferred place to buy gas for some years now. 

Unfortunately this particular location, which is the closest to my home, has got to be the WORST-RUN Shell I've ever dealt with.  The service here is consistently terrible, beset with rude and ignorant staff who know very little (and care even less) about anything other than trying to upsell you at the register.  Stock-outs of convenience items are frequent.  And to add insult to injury, the yard area is kept like a pigsty, with broken fencing, garbage in the landscaping, and piles of old shelves and crates and crap on the property.   

How Shell Canada can allow this place to be run this way is entirely beyond me.  Are they THAT desparate for operators???",1
12342,2,1547856000000,"We ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich, a cheese burger and fries.  The sandwiches and fries were well prepared and presented, the flavors good but not outstanding. Non of the dishes were 'the best we've ever had'.  Some of the disappointment may have stemmed from the slow and careless service we received.  We came in for a late lunch on a holiday.  There were plentiful wait staff and kitchen staff present but from the hostess to the waiter every part of the process seemed to be in slow motion. When the food did arrive the side dish and the sandwich toppings were not as ordered.  They did correct the side dish order but again in relative slow motion.  I would only come back here if I was looking for a pleasant place to idyll away 2 hours in downtown Phoenix.  I never saw the butcher and can't say if he really is arrogant.",2

12361,1,1547078400000,"Ok.  I don't think this place is 5 star, but I also think the 2 star and 1 star reviews are harsh.  Is it overpriced chinese food.  Absolutely, but you've also got to expect that from the STRIP.  Also,  you can tell the experience of the chefs because the food is more delicate than your typical hole in the wall chinese that they're being compared to.  

That being said,  we arrived on 930pm when they close at 1030pm.  Important to get there earlier as they stop taking people around this time.  We made it just in time.  I saw the hostess turn people away at 10pm.  Anyway,  we had the shanghai soup dumplings,  sautéed pea tips, dan dan mian, chicken broth with hand pulled noodles, chinese pancake with beef, jellyfish salad, hot sour soup and pot stickers.  

Warning, the dan dan noodles are super spicy and salty, so just know this before you order.  None of the food was bad.  It was tasty, but not the best chinese I've ever had. But will satisfy the chinese craving.  The sauteed veggies were well done and not overcooked.  

Hand pulled noodles were chewy and delish.  The soup dumplings were very good, so we had to add another order.  All in all,  if I wanted noodles or chinese and didn't want to leave the hotel,  I would eat here.  The service was fine.  Typically I have fairly low standards for service at asian establishments.  You know you're doing for food,  not the service.  Have that expectation in mind and you won't leave angry at any asian establishment.  Just a tip.",2

He stated he wanted to resolve the issue of an uninformed mandatory gratuity charged.  However, not once made an attempt to rectify the situation.

12368,3,1548374400000,"This place is low key awesome. I can appreciate small takeout businesses that know how to cook and treat you like royalty. When you walk in you're greeted by a very friendly hostess and the smell of delicious soul food. The ambiance isn't upscale by any measure, but what you will bring home to eat will definitely deter you from making judgments based on the way the book looks on the outside. I enjoyed the conversation with the hostess while I waited, mainly because she is also from Chicago as well, and we connected on so many levels. Not to mention, all of the patrons were very happy too...good food'll do that to you. 

Now to the food! I ordered the catfish dinner w/okra and rice & gravy. I also picked up the 4 wing dinner with cabbage and Mac & cheese for the Mrs. I was happy to see that my catfish dinner had two HUGE, REAL, and DELICIOUS fillets! You see, here in the desert, it's difficult to find fresh catfish that is not swai, and there's is no knockoff. Okra was delicious too with generous portions. Also difficult to find in LV are WHOLE chicken wings fried to perfection while bursting with flavor. Well, I found them here. I only got to eat one wing, as my lady and I swapped portions of our dinners,  but we both knew instantly that we were in tastebud bliss. Oh, and the Mac and cabbage took me back to my grandma's kitchen...absolutely perfect.

We washed it all down with a couple of Wapatooli's (just get you some, it's heaven in a cup) and shared a fresh, moist piece of Carmel cake. If I had to take off half a star, it would be due to the short hours. This place is only open six hours per day for six days, and I find it difficult to get there due to working hours. However, best believe I will be back on my off day to try more of their food!",3

12394,1,1546992000000,"Vivoli is right in the heart of Toronto's Little Italy and is always a hotspot! It is especially popular during the summer with its huge patio with plenty of wine and food flowing around for all to enjoy.

I was able to reserve a table for a group dinner at Vivoli last spring and was happy with the service and the warm atmosphere. 

The food was absolutely delicious and flavourful, however, I can agree with the previous person who reviewed this restaurant about some of the portions being a bit small.  

So if you have an appetite for good Italian food but you want a larger portion, you will need to order more food options or come with a less hearty appetite to begin with.

And in addition, I would recommend this place as a date location to grab a glass of wine or a light dinner with your special person. My boyfriend and I enjoyed a wonderful night last summer on Vivoli's patio, taking back some white wine and enjoying the candlelight.

12435,1,1547683200000,"This place was pretty disappointing. We visited on a Friday a few weeks ago. I realize they just opened, but it feels like they were drastically underprepared. The ambience and atmosphere are top notch - great decor and the jazz band in the background was awesome. 

The food was mediocre though, and the operations were downright poor. My friend ordered a long island mule that was gross and I ordered a martini, but they were out of olives! By the way, the martini was a featured drink on the menu, so it's not like my order was out of nowhere. They had a nice selection of beers on the menu, but they only actually had probably half of them available. (Again, poor operations.) 

As for the food, the chicken was OK - not bad, but not as good as you'd expect from a place called ""Chicken and Waffles"" - good taste, but pretty dry. The waffle was a flop - literally, no crispness at all. Again, OK taste on it,  just poorly prepared (note: just let the waffle iron get hot first guys - it's simple!) The sides (biscuit, red beans and rice) were bad - clearly not home-made on either. 

The bartender was a nice guy and did his best. The manager (I think?) spent his entire evening walking around chatting with the guests. He tried to sell us on reserving the main table for any events we have planned. That was a turn off, considering this place could be good if they got their operations in order.

Fram Grill serves fantastic meals in a cozy space suited for both indoor or outdoor seating. Regardless of party size, the Farm Grill can accommodate you! There awesome picnic tables scattered outside, many of them situated under large shade trees to keep you out of that AZ sun. If air conditioning is your thing, then there are plenty of indoor seats that provide a much cooler climate during the summer daze.

If you've dined at one of Joe's other restaurants you know the food will be good. All ingredients are sourced locally, and many of the veggies are farmed right behind the shop in Agrotopia farms. You can walk over after your meal to watch them harvest the greens, spices, veggies, etc. And let me tell you, when you are biting into that freshly grilled hamburger you can taste how fresh those onions and leaf lettuce is! It's awesome. The salads are massive in size and super fresh. There's a couple of BBQ items that are delicious too. 

Drink options are fun. The organic brand Tractor Soda is served here and they offer fun and unique carbonated flavors such as Cola, Root Beer, Ginger Beer, Cherry Cream, Coconut, Blood Orange, Lemon Grass, Meyer Lemon and Cucumber. They are awesome!! (You can also grab a traditional canned soda if you're not feeling adventurous). 

Breakfast is served here as well, and there's a great kids menu for both breakfast and lunch. Joe has really built up this corner of Gilbert- there's an awesome coffee shop steps away from the Farm Grill if you'd like a nice espresso after your meal. Grab an award winning cupcake there if there's any room left in your stomach! Walk a few more paces and visit the new hangar co-op space. You'll find cool wares and food there too!

They're really nice about adding extra garlic sauce on top. I once tried my friend's and they had the seasoning put on it. It was a potent taste that I didn't care for. It was almost like Cayenne pepper. Just tell them you don't want it. The only thing that kills it for me is the rice is so bland so it ruins the flavor of the chicken and sauces.

Walking in we liked the decor, were greeted nicely - but their was this smell of cleaning chemicals that was a bit strong. I'm a bit sensitive to this, affects my appetite, but I was happy to know the place was clean. 

We sat up front so we could people watch out the window. Server was nice and fast. I ordered their Guinness Brisket sandwich and my wife got the hummus salad. The sandwich was good, but the menu said it was on sourdough - and it might of been - but tasted like a hamburger bun. I've never had sourdough with sesame seeds. The horseradish sauce on it was ok, but not very hot. I think most people see ""horseradish"" and expect a little zing! Chips were great and not too salty which I love.

I ordered two garlic shrimp appetizers, two soups of the day, and garlic chicken with rice. The service was pleasant and the bartender assisted with my order. The food was prepared in ~20 minutes and smell from the packaging was alluring.

The packing however was inappropriate and led to the sauce spilling throughout the box. Additionally, instead of using clear covers over the foil containers, white covers were used so it was impossible to quickly check to see if all food ordered had been packed and given to me. That's a rookie mistake an experienced restaurant shouldn't be making--it led to my rice being left out. I literally received chicken bathing in a ton of sauce and zero rice. 

The soups had a very odd flavor. They consisted of kale, olive oil (Lord knows why) and a green broth. If the oil hadn't been there it would have been pleasant. The chicken was good but far too thin. The shrimp were okay but overcooked. And they packed two orders of shrimp into one container. Why? How did they know two different people wouldn't be eating the shrimp appetizers? 

I would return to try dining at Mallorca. But I wouldn't do takeout again. They don't pack appropriately and seem to take liberties with take-out customers that they would not take with dine-in customers.",2

I think of it as the world's classiest frat house - it has a laid-back, casual feel with sofas instead of restaurant tables and two floors to amble around and chat with others, and it also has expensive, delicious cocktails that would make any mixologist proud. Ed, who works on the upper floor, is also a super cool dude who loves talking with his customers. Finally, they have tiny boxes of spicy noodles that are just perfect to fill your tummy after you've had a few drinks here. I will confess that it doesn't emphasize beer or wine. Come here for cocktails, because they're best for it and they don't really have anything else besides cocktails anyhow.",2

12517,1,1547078400000,"Used the Groupon for the Tasting Menu tonight and have to say I was very disappointed with the event. To start off the host is incredibly full of himself, overly brisk, with the feeling that you should understand you are lucky to be in his restaurant. The tasting menu is definitely a tasting menu, a small taste of a few things. The rooms are lovely, the design excellent, the service staff very efficient. A very large investment has been made in far out dishware, too bad the same can't be said for the food. The serving plates were piping hot, sadly not hot enough to heat up the food. The cheese course was a joke, reminiscent of those cardboard circular cheese boxes with a dozen triangles of tasteless cheese, along with two tiny smears of soemthing that may have tasted good if there was enough to taste. The lobster bisque tasted oddly sour for some reason. The main: Tyle Fish could have come from Captain Highliner, the sauce was so incredibly spicy there was no tasting of the fish. Lukewarm mashed potatoes (they cool of quickly when there is only a teaspoon of them, could have come from a box of powder. The dessert sampler was merely amusing. The biggest item on the menu was pretension, definitely more than I needed.

To finish off the evening we were presented with a menu card that ordered us to pay a $25.00 tip! Nothing less, nothing more. 

When a restaurant starts off by acknowledging that they have rough rubes as customers and need to be instructed on tipping, they lost me.

Groupons and Winterlicious should be mediums to bring in new customers to become regular customers, not to drive them away after one evening.


I am rethinking my whole interest in Groupons and such.  Tell me I am getting a hundred dollar meal for a discount, and then give me a discount meal with an inflated tip and I am soooo outtta there!",2

Again a disappointment. Peeled off the same day. What is worse is this establishments idea of customer service. I called to get them redone and they couldn't fit me that week, but was told that a manager would call me. No call. Called several more times being told a manager would call me back for a refund. No return call. Tried to send an email. Invalid email address. Virtually this is a take your money and run business.

I was hesitant for years because it opened shortly after that Gangnam Style song came out, but moved to this side of town and I didn't want to go to Chinatown for Korean BBQ. This isn't all you can eat, but it's actually a lot more fun ordering and you get to be a little more selective. We ordered the spicy karaage, Kabocha squash tempura and the shishito peppers as appetizers. All delicious, especially the squash. We had reservations so all the complimentary side dishes were arranged around the grill upon arrival. For the grill we ordered two orders each of the scallops with bacon, bulgogi, harami miso, and Kalbi, along with an order of corn. We had five people in our party and we didn't finish it all, but got pretty close! It's a really fun experience and it doesn't feel as rushed or impersonal as other places. The decor is also really nice and it doesn't feel like your typical all you can eat/buffet place. Loved it and will definitely be back",1

I ordered the enchilada trio and my advice is to sub the mole third for ranchera or verde instead. The mole sauce is so overpowering and there really is no way for me to explain it. It almost ruined the rest of my meal with the lingering taste and smell. It comes with a side of beans and rice which were both not your typical Mexican sides. Had fresh veggies and mushrooms. 
Our waiter was either hungover or new. Would definitely go back to try something else or would be a fun place to grab drinks and tacos with friends.",2

I was pleasantly surprised by the fois gras, Nice selection on pickled veggies, meat and cheese. I knew before arriving that I would have the carbonara for my entree by all the yelp pictures!

12564,1,1548547200000,"It is good to have something new in Mississauga, so we will have more competitions.

We ordered 2 kinds of dumpling, steam and pan fried. Both of their dumplings were pretty good, and they were very juicy inside.

We also ordered spicy pig ear, but it turned out to be very tasteless and not spicy at all.

The spicy beef tendon was the best dish so far for the night. It was spicy, and very tasty. It just make my mouth watery even thinking of it again.

We also had some of their noodle soup and pork wonton, and I have to say its pretty good as well.

The bad part about this restaurant were:
1. Maybe they are new or maybe business is pretty good. We had to change 2 of the dishes because they told us they don't have it.
2. Half of our dishes we ordered were kind of tasteless, maybe they wanted to be on the healthy side but I had many China style food before and this restaurant was the tasteless one I found. We ordered around 10 dishes, and 4 of the dishes were pretty bland.
3. The tea that they gave us are ""watery"". You guys know how tea has this tanned color in them but their tea was like clear boiled water with few tea leafs inside. I looked inside the tea pot but there was no tea leafs inside. I assumed the tea came out from a central machine and they didn't change the old tea leafs to a new one and used that batch all day long. Also, the ""watery tea"" was warm and not hot.

Price was alright. I might go back but probably will just eat their dumplings....",1
12568,3,1547510400000,"Restaurant review
After 1 year of living in Champaign, I finally had a chance to come to this restaurant recommended my a previous coworker. The reviews on Yelp are quite mix and it appears that lunch is good, but dinner is so so. Since I have not found another restaurant that has chocolate fondue here in Central IL, we decided to come here for dinner. I will say that I really wanted to like this restaurant, but overall value is a 2 star, the option for fondue brings it up to a 2.5. It is located right on campus and I never even knew about this restaurant when I lived nearby. The ambiance is very eclectic, lots of wall decorations and a European cafe feel. The multiple non-matching chairs throughout the dining room maybe a ""modern"" design, but I felt it was very ""chintzy"". I thought about going with the filet or fish entree, but the other reviews made me a little concern so I went with a safe dish (Shrimp fettuccine) with a light tomato basil cream sauce. It took a bit of time for the dish to come out. Meanwhile, we were given complimentary french bread. Given the name of the restaurant I was a bit disappointed that the bread was not a soft piping hot bread from the oven. Well I digress, back to the entree, it really wasn't anything special. My wife's quote on her salmon salad and the pasta was, ""It taste like food you can make at home"". The portions sizes were also smaller than expected when you order pasta at a restaurant. I was hoping that the chocolate fondue would be the redeeming value of the meal. Unfortunately this was not the case. Typically you would expect strawberries and maybe even a rice crispy treat to dip in the chocolate. Don't get me wrong the dark chocolate was amazing, but they gave a plate of pears, green and red apples, and some sort of cake that crumbled when you poked at it too hard with the fondue fork. Service is hit or miss, our server came by a few times and made sure our cups of water were filled. This maybe a great place for date night on campus or maybe for sandwiches at lunch, but my dinner experience was so so.

Pros: Cheese and chocolate fondue, I have yet to find another place that has this option. Great for date night with wine, cheese, bread etc. 

Cons: Expensive based on what you get, small portion size, no hot fresh bread from the bread company for dinner, where are the strawberries, marshmallow, or rice krispy treats with the chocolate fondue? I think if they tried they could make this a stellar restaurant here in CU.

Hidden deals: Daily drink and food specials on the chalk board

12573,1,1546819200000,"My mother, husband and I are huge fans of Toro Toro, but we decided to give Tapas 24 a try... But were met with huge disappointment, although given the so-so reviews, I guess I wasn't that surprised. First off, the atmosphere is complete different and seriously lacks the charm of Toro Toro. It just feels like an urban restaurant, nothing spanish about it. Moreover, it took about 20 mins for a waitress to come greet us, and tell us she would be back soon to take our drink order. So we waited and chatted away. We didn't understand the wine menu so wanted some help picking out a wine. When the waitress finally bothered to come check up on us, first off she spoke to us in english. I know we are franco-ontarian and have an accent, but how rude. Not only did we keep speaking to her in french she kept answering us in english. Although this was nothing special for Montreal. She didn't really know the wine menu, and informed us that the sommelier would come see us. Now we were very hungry and at this point it had already been 40 mins. We were seated next to the kitchen so it was very loud, and distracting to see all the waiters walk in and out in a continuous stream. Moreover the menu was some type of hybrid tapas menu. The classic spanish ""patatas bravas"" were in fact just fries... and I have never heard of foie gras at a tapas bar in Spain. So we were VERY fed up. One hour in, water as drinks, no orders taken, lack-luster looking food, and bad atmosphere. It didn't take much more for us to leave and make our way to Toro Toro, where we were greeted with a smile, and immediately told about the wine list. So all in all... Save your time and money and have a wonderful evening next door at Toro Toro.",3

The margarita pizza was amazing- wood fired crust was cooked perfectly, and the cheese, basil and marinara were all on point. All the pies I saw looked great! Good place to go watch sports also.",2

12596,1,1546905600000,"Because we saw Anthony Bourdain eat at Bouchon on ""No Reservations"" and rave about the food, we put Bouchon on our list of restaurants to visit. And we didn't eat there just once -- because brunch at Bouchon was so tasty on our first day in Vegas, we left Vegas on a high note and visited Bouchon again for brunch on our last day! 

The restaurant has a cute, vintage bistro atmosphere with eye-catching tilework. The staff is great at seating guests near the windows by the courtyard during breakfast and brunch. And the homemade butter is so fantastic that you might just eat the butter by itself. 

So during our two visits, we ate:
-Croque Madame: it's like taking the most perfect eggs benedict you can imagine, replacing the types of bread, and then making the dish even more delectable and delicious. 
-Brioche french toast: incredible! The toast pieces had no sogginess or heaviness; instead, the toast was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. 
-Omelette with salad: tasty and fluffy omelette with a fantastic mixed greens salad. The vinaigrette was flavorful yet light and was great for breakfast/brunch.
-Pastries: this place knows what it's doing with pastries! We ate a chocolate croissant and pecan sticky bun at the restaurant and also enjoyed a macaron from the Bouchon Bakery stand in the Venetian on the main floor. Don't go anywhere else and order a pastry; get your pastry at Bouchon!

Put Bouchon on your list for Vegas breakfast/brunch places. If it's morning and you're hungry, go to Bouchon, and you will not be disappointed.",2

12703,1,1548460800000,"Soooo I was checking out my Yelp profile and decided to up my ante with another review... this time, not so great.  

I was starving (what else is new?) on a Friday night so I dragged my boyfriend out for some Mexican fare.  Let's start at the door: the hostess didn't look too excited to greet or seat us.  Our server took our drink order, we received our trusty chips and salsa, and got to work.  

The menu was pretty standard for an ""upscale"" Mexican restaurant, seafood selection and all.  After the server described ""The Monterrey"" plate as one you could fit a turkey on, I was convinced.  This hefty entree consists of four different types of enchiladas, a chile cheese relleno, chicken taco, and guac... how could we possibly go wrong?

The plate arrived ginormous, as promised; I just wasn't particularly impressed by any of it.  As much as I love food, I am a quality over quantity kind of girl, and this entree was not cuttin' it.  I honestly can't point out anything in particular that I did not like about the plate, it just wasn't memorable, finger lickin' good, or (please insert cliche here).  

When dessert was offered, we politely declined.  Our waiter dropped the check fleetingly and muttered a ""Thank You"" or something of that sort as he zipped past our table.  I do give the place props on decor, as the paintings, statues, and lighting throughout the restaurant are impressive and reminiscent of the culture of Mexico.",1

I got the grilled chicken breast sandwich with onion rings (really thick but pretty tasty)My sister got the white pizza and was very pleased with it and said she'd get it again.

Our overall impression on our first trip To Frankie and Louie's on a Sunday after church, was the food was okay, the service left much to be desired and I thought the pricing was a little high for the offerings.  I might try it again if going with a group, but doubt I'd dine in again alone.",3

The front of the bar opens to the street, in case you need a peak inside before settling into one of the booths or at the bar. The cocktail list features many intriguing craft cocktails. I was drawn to the mad men whiskey based cocktail. Think a more detailed version of an old fashion. We had a few drinks here and managed to actually have a conversation, as this bar was more quiet than most others in the area. 

The decor is dark wood, so inviting after walking for hours under the blistering sun. The booths looked small but comfortable, and probably helped keep the conversations low, you don't really need to scream if your party is within whisper distance. I can see this bar being popular with the singles that like to mingle. The lights are low, the tables small, all key ingredients for romance. The music, whether chosen by the staff or a satellite station was kick ass, lots of great local music mixed with the now popular local bands. I.e. Arcade Fire, Wolf Mother, etc. 

If I lived in MTL I would make this a frequent stop for after dinner drinks with coworkers. Especially in the winter, when a good drink can mean the difference between being comfortably cold and just plain freexing your ass off.",2

I love a good experience and this place is just downright comfortable. All that being said, everyone's entitled to their opinion. I see a lot of bad reviews for this place on here, but if you haven't tried this restaurant yet, don't let the negativity stop you from taking the plunge. You can decide for yourself.

You should check this place out if you're in the area. The service is fantastic, and you'll be supporting a local business. How refreshing. 

There's something on the menu for everyone, including a tasty chilero salad for those watching their calories. I always order the shrimp quesadilla, though, with the side of raspberry chipotle sauce. It's addicting, and I find myself craving Chilero's from time to time. It's just one entree I'll never grow tired of eating... In fact, I'm craving it now!

Hey, the last time I went with the family, it was my suggestion to come here!

Charlotte has a handful of salad places, but none compare to Chopt. I've been in love with this place since I first ate at a Chopt years ago in nyc, and I was thrilled to hear we were getting one here. It totally lived up to my expectations, and more! The ambiance is clean and fresh. The staff is friendly, and the service is quick. The menu is great. It's not just your regular 3 or 4 types of salads that you add your favorite protein to, but at the same time it isn't overwhelming and complicated. Best of all - they chop up your salad really good - that does make a huge difference in how your salad tastes. The portions are great for the price, and oh to make things even better they source a lot of their produce locally!! Now all we need is a few more locations around town! I had their Kebab Cobb salad, while the hubs tried their New York Street Cart salad. I can't decide which one I liked better. If you love salads, try Chopt, I doubt you will be disappointed.",2

My wife and I ordered farfalle with chicken and the four cheese pasta with two meatballs. These two entrees were far from good.  Both, yes both, lacked any flavor. ANY FLAVOR!! The bread provided before the meal had more.  The four cheese pasta with meatballs tasted like it was just pulled from the microwave.  My wife's meal was no different.

******

I've passed by this place periodically since it opened a year or so ago, but hadn't gone in until today for lunch. Aronis & Dimitra's is a traditional Greek bistro, and the only Greek restaurant in the St. Clair & Christie neigbourhood. They're open all day, and the menu ranges from breakfasts (served every day until 4:00pm)  salads, and souvlaki on a pita to full dinners (seafood and grilled items.) Their vegetarian menu seems to be pretty good as well.

I'll have to go back sometime for either breakfast or dinner, but my first meal there went straight to the basics: a chicken souvlaki on a pita. It was absolutely perfect. We're talking about nicely seasoned & grilled chicken, fresh tomatoes and lettuce, grilled onions, and cool tzatziki sauce, all wrapped in a grilled Greek pita, and wrapped in foil to keep the juices out of my hands in the pita. Yum, yum. 

For what it's worth, the guy at the table next to me appeared to be a regular -- he got a breakfast that looked pretty good, and the waitress said that their omelettes are great.  (I'd suggest trying this place rather than going down to the mediocre-but-oddly-popular chain breakfast place on St. Clair & Glenholm....you know what I'm talkin' about....the one with the line out the door every weekend.)

Overall, my first impression is that this is one of those great restaurants that is easy to pass right by, but which is genuinely worth checking out. What it lacks in ambience, it makes up for with the good food. So, if you're up for some delicious homemade Greek cooking or a substantial and reasonably priced breakfast,  this is the place to go in this particular neighbourhood. (They also do take-out, and sometime soon they're going to start a delivery service.)",2

12877,2,1546560000000,"I've been here for dinner, but breakfast at Bouchon is where it's at for me.  In fact, every time I come to Vegas, I have to come here for breakfast at least once, and I pretty much order the same thing - quiche of the day, side of potatoes lyonnaise, and coffee.  The quiche (sometimes it's Lorraine, sometimes it's Florentine, this last time was escarole and bacon) never disappoints.  Always silky smooth, flavorful, and with a flaky crust, I could probably have it every morning of my trip.

The quiche comes with a nice little salad with a mild vinaigrette dressing, which balances the quiche nicely, but I always have to have some potatoes - it's breakfast, after all, and salad for breakfast must be addressed by potatoes.  The lyonnaise is usually a little on the oily side, which may be off-putting for some, but I like it.  I've had versions where the potatoes are crispy from near deep-frying, but these are cooked how they're supposed to be, with the potatoes lightly sautéed and tender.  Sometimes they need a touch of salt, but better to add salt than come too salty, right?

Some people rave about the coffee, but for me it's just okay.  I've had the coffee at Bouchon Bakery in NYC and it's the same.  I prefer mellower coffee that doesn't have that tang to it.    Amongst coffee lovers, I seem to be in the minority on this one.  However, I still always seem to drink at least four cups, so....

The service is usually great.  Even the worst service I had was still good compared to other places, so their folks are trained well.  Only complaint is sometimes we get bread, sometimes we don't - haven't been able to figure that one out.  Maybe I'll ask the next time I go, which I hope is soon!",3

Walked in and immediately had a flashback to the time I was at Yonaka. No Japanese patron found and place was packed with haole. Usually that's not a good sign for me but I always give the benefit of the doubt. First thing I noticed was how smoky the place was. There seems to be no ventilation of any sort but surprisingly, no one seemed bothered by it.  Atmosphere is  dark and intimate, perfect for the dinner occasion I was at. 

Started out with some oysters which are part of the special. They were fresh and plump. My favorite has to be their little skookum oysters which were really sweet and fresh. 

Grilled branzino with sweet potato. Holy moly. Grilled and seasoned perfectly. Fish was boneless and was grilled with lemons and bunch of different herbs. 

Waffle fries. The dipping sauce was bomb.com! It was a creamy aeoli sauce with some tangyness and was perfect with their crispy waffle fries.

*From here, I was a little intoxicated and don't remember the exact name of each dish

Also tried their spicy salmon roll with lemon and caviar. At first, I thought slices of lemon they had in between each roll was just for a presentation but I ate it with the rolls and wow. Flavor parade.  I guess it is good to be intoxicated while trying something new because you get to be adventurous. Lesson learned.

Steamed mussels in a pot. It was a recommended dish but turned out to be ok. Mussels were small and nothing mind blowing.

My family are owners here so that is the main reason why we stayed here. The rooms were nice and kept clean - except for the beds. They had little mirrors on the backboards and you could see it dirtied with fingerprints ALL OVER. It doesn't leave a good image in your head. There was a spa tub in one of the rooms and it wasn't even worth time to use it - I tried to fill it but the water took forever to rise and I felt like I was just wasting water. What usually would take 20 minutes AT MOST, it took over an hour and it didn't even fill halfway - not cool. 

The pool was very nice but they don't allow you to bring in your own food or drink, which is understandable, but it would be nice to have my own water bottle with me instead of paying for another one. We had a cabana each time we went to the pool so it was nice to have with the heat. There are misters above the cabana but you can barely feel them and mainly spray upward instead of down so they were pretty much useless.  

Overall for the staff, they were very nice and helpful. My dad and stepmom have stayed here before and one of our waitresses remembered them so that was nice to know that they remember their clientele. The issue we ran into the most was trying to call them. The numbers listed online do not send you to a direct person or it doesn't take you to the hotel directly; so that was very frustrating. My family traveled in an overly large RV and my dad had called months in advance to make sure that we would be able to park the RV in their parking garage. When we got there it took my dad over 2 hours to park it because the staff didn't know what to do with the RV and where it was supposed to be parked. We ended up parking in the garage so that was finally resolved.

Overall a good stay for our trip; the hotel is connected to a mall and Planet Hollywood so we were able to get around places very easily. Even though I'm an owner at this resort, I'd probably stay at another hotel my next time in Vegas so I can get a different experience.",2

We started with zucchini blossoms which I believe were stuffed with goat cheese and maybe corn?? Served with a mango sauce. Fantastic.

My main was a seasoned tuna steak, served rare over the most delicious toasted couscous I've ever eaten. My co-diners had the blue corn crusted halibut which was outrageous and the pork medallions which were seasoned with ancho chilis and southwestern spices - also delicious. We of course had the roasted corn side which you must have.

The margaritas are custom crafted, delicious. 

The only negative is that the restaurant gets quite loud but we had a great table and great servers.",2

Since moving to Arizona and have lived all over the valley, this has been my best experience at a nail salon. Best news: they are completely inexpensive. 

I definitely will be back in 2-3 weeks for my fill :)

12932,3,1546300800000,"Likely won't ""Hola back"" here any time soon. Came here on a busy night based on the Yelp reviews and spent the rest of the night trying to figure out how this place has so many 5 star reviews. The spot is cozy and the front staff (1 person) is nice. I would label this pace as a bar first with food to snack on vs a dinner spot. I want to love this place but can't. I hope the restaurant will read this review and adjust. Or perhaps I came on an off night. 

The menu consists of tapas ($7-9) and some larger tapas ($25-32). For a place on the east end of Leslieville, it's creeping on the high end for a dinner. Drinks are aggressively priced at $12-14 which I would expect if they had full time bar staff vs the combo waiter/barman/host they have working the whole room. These are downtown prices for drinks vs east end ( a few blocks from Greenwood. )

Portions here are small. The small tapas are cocktail sized at 2 servings and roughly $8-10. Large entrees are $25-32 and roughly medium sized plates. I've been to places where the portions are small but their flavour was huge to make up for it. This is not one of them. The food here seems authentic and decent but not overly special. 

""A"", for effort from the one staffer working the room. He worked hard but he needed help. ""C"", for overall execution. Like all graded things, I hope to see improvement here.",2
12936,2,1548374400000,"Over the past year they have been making a number of renovations to this location.  Most notably to the rooms themselves.  

What used to look and feel like low rent budget hotel rooms, now have the appeal of their ""upper class"" counterparts in the downtown Montréal area. 

They have new beds, new linens, newly upholstered furniture, and a remodeled bathroom...

I have to say... I stayed at the Residence Inn Montréal back in August, for double-plus the price of this hotel, and quite honestly the Quality Inn on Crescent is a much better value.  And now that they've made the renovations, the rooms are actually better in quality (not just price) then the Marriott in town.

The only reason I'm not throwing 5 Stars at this place, can't REALLY be blamed on them... but since they have their logo on it, it'll go against them.

The parking lot... Now I know full well that the parking situation is the same it's been since I started staying here a few years ago.  $20 per night in the lot next door (or if full up, across the street)... but that the lot wasn't ""owned"" by the the hotel, but it was endorsed by them.  

So I pull in and the old man taking everyone's money is trying to skim an extra $5 out of everyone that pulls in.  His excuse, he said that he charged ""larger cars like Cadillacs an extra $5, like an SUV.""  Well first off, I've parked my SAME car here in this lot many times over the past few years, along with my buddy's SUV.  Never have I heard of this extra fee.  But what really made me fight him on it was that he was trying to charge the carload of girls ahead of me an extra $5 because they ""were going to the Canadiens game.""  Mind you they were driving a compact little car, and had said they were staying in the hotel and spending the night there.  Which should've got them the regular (as marked on the sign) $20 for 24 hours fee.  He was just straight up skimming and I wasn't about to let this guy rip me off.  So I argued with him for a bit until he agreed to take just my $20CAD for the 24 hours... I have to admit, I felt lucky to get my car back on all 4 wheels the next morning.  But my piece of mind was worth it.

Never the less... I will be absolutely staying at this Quality Inn in the future!",2

I tried AEROPRESS and fell in love with the taste and smoothness of this style of brew. They had a live solo musican playing coffeehouse type of music (guitar and voice), it really is a nice touch and great way for local musicans to jam and get exposure. I love how they had the windows open inside and allowed the natural air to come in. They also have an outdoor patio, board games and light bites. Unfortunately, I looked up them up before I visited and saw that they offerred tamales, however; that is not the case anymore in which I was disappointed. They need to update their on line menu!! I tried the BREAKFAST SANDWICH, it did the job but there was NO roasted tomato vinaigrette in it instead there was MAYO- yuck. I didnt feel like complaining as I was slightly hungover.

It seemed like because we didn't order alcohol he could not be bothered to provide us with better service. We ordered and the food was so so. Lacked flavor. The curry shrimp lacked curry and the shrimp was over cooked and rubbery. The scallops were tiny and seasoned / cooked poorly.  The chicken parm was pre breaded frozen product that was cooked then pan fried in wine and covered in sauce. No salad or soup or bread with your entree and they are not cheap. $16- $26 a plate. Ordered a Coke it was flat. Sent it back 3 times. Ordered lemonade it was over powering then got a new glass that was weak. Never going back and you should avoid this place. Not worth the value,2

12990,2,1546905600000,"**** CRISPY BACON *****

We went to Wicked Spoon on a Thursday, I tried their bacon, was disappointed.

We got 2 free vouchers for free Buffet, at The Buffet in Treasure Island---
Was a bit unwillingly to go because of the reviews on Yelp,
But who was going to pass up a free buffet??

We got there around 11.
Half of the Right was Lunch, The other half Breakfast. Behind, dessert.

The Lunch area, was awesome.
There was a sushi bar, with all the condiments.
Next to it, was Chinese dishes, I really liked their shrimp dumplings,
And their Vegetable Spring Rolls were AWESOME.
Deliciously crunchy (not soggy) and fresh.

They had a customization of Chow Mein and PHO, and other noodle dishes,
Pretty cool!!
Along that was a Meat Section//Turkey Area.
**Some of the Buffets still offer Thanksgiving selections:
Turkey, Yams, Mashed Potatoes, Gravy, Corn Bread, etc.

They still had an omlette station, but they were cleaning up since we were there between Breakfast and Lunch.

They were replacing the omlette station for a Pasta Station! Pretty awesome.

So the breakfast they offered was sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs,
Potatoes, pancakes, french toast, crepes, some other stuff lol.

I noticed how CRISPY the bacon looked, and just thought:
""That's how you cook bacon""
It was so delicious and crispy, not like Wicked Spoon's chewy bacon. (Don't get bacon at Wicked Spoon or the Kalbi Short Ribs)

The dessert area was super cute! I loved it.
Tiny desserts.
Cotton Candy. Mini Donuts (They have their version of blue berry donuts, it's hella good, and also Beignets!!) They had a strawberry shortcake in a cup,
Fancy Fudge, tiny fruit tarts, Dreyers Ice Cream. Different slices of Cakes.

I really liked the bacon LOL.
Everything else was great, and they give you wet naps for later.",2
12992,2,1547078400000,"I'm a long time Yelp consumer, but I've never felt compelled to contribute. After meticulously reviewing air conditioning companies, I settled on Chandler Air for my problems, as this was the one with the least objectionable reviews. Because the process behind locating a trustworthy and capable A/C company is so difficult, I thought I'd provide my experience with Chandler Air so people can know this IS a company worth using. 

I've given Chandler Air 5 stars for three reasons: (1) Honest/Integrity; (2) Technical capability; and (3) Price.

Honest/Integrity - My technician was Dave. When he arrived at my house, I quickly suggested that my old Goodman units may need replacing. Even with offering this bait, Dave never tried to upsell me on new units - rather noticing that mine were in fine working order aside from a single problem. 

Technical capability - Another technician from another company had been to my house previously and was unable to resolve my problem. Although Dave noticed the malfunction with my system was something he hadn't encountered in some time, he was able to accurately diagnose it. He even returned home to check with some of his resources to ensure he was right - and he was. By the way, his fix for our system worked wonders. 

Price - Many companies have been charging upwards of $100-$115/pound for R-22 Freon. This is understandable because it's becoming more scarce by the second. Chandler Air charged me $68/pound, which I feel is extraordinarily reasonable. In fact, I've yet to find anyone in the Valley who sells it cheaper. Dave also spent approximately three hours at my house, although I was only charged for two hours of labor  because that's what I'd been quoted. He was thorough in his inspection of my system, which is likely what warranted the extra time (and is much appreciated by me). 

Ultimately, Chandler Air is the real deal. I have no connection to the company and have used it to resolve only the one problem - so I have no vested interest in posting this positive review. This is the first time I've ever had an A/C company come to one of my houses without either not being able to resolve the problem or trying to sell me a new unit, so I thought this review was warranted. 

Thanks to Dave & Co at Chandler Air.",2
12992,3,1546387200000,"Starbucks and the like have completely diluted the meaning of good coffee and have lined us up like cattle only to be treated to a burned tasteless cup of joe. Mocha Mountain aims to set the record straight, by serving up what they do best; coffee.

The Mountain can be hard to find as it is sandwiched between a used car dealership and a gas station, but this literal log cabin with two drive up windows is worth the search.

When you pull up, you are always greeted by one of the friendly people that work there and you get this feeling as if they really care about the product they are serving. You may have to wait a couple extra minutes at Mocha Mountain but anyone who knows good espresso knows that good espresso makers do not make instant coffee. Trust me, the end result is worth it. The espresso never tastes burnt and if it is not up to your liking they will always make you a new one. They have like 40 flavors you can mix in (if coffee flavor is not your thing) to take your palette on a wild ride and have some of the best biscotti in the city delivered fresh daily. 

The best part, each cup of coffee comes with a chocolate covered coffee bean, the perfect compliment to a perfect cup. Break the norm and try the Mountain today!",2
12995,1,1548892800000,Well? What can I say about this place? Certainly not what I expected! It was a disappoint since I was really looking forward to some authentic Louisiana Cajun cooking!

I did not know that it was counter only service. I DID know that they are dog friendly which being a big animal lover with 4 dogs that lives in the neighborhood is a big deal for me. I will throw my hard earned bucks to local establishments like this! I decided to go in today with one of my dogs and tried to get service which at first it was ok. I got a younger gentleman in which I was able to get his attention, then an older guy (Bryan) that I have seen my one other visit there before took over the bar area. Since I know I cannot walk in with my dog I tried to get his attention. Bryan saw me but obviously decided best to not ask me if I need any help or anything at all and talk to some folks (probably regulars) at the bar area and JUST IGNORE ME. I went back to my table upset and disappointed. I wanted to stay and have another drink and even order food but I decided against it. I expressed my feelings to him on the service. I told him it was an opportunity lost on their end. They had my card on hold as I was planning on staying longer and I asked for it back. He did comp me and I was appreciative of the fact- just wish it did not have to come to that.

Despite a rather crappy location being behind the rest of a shopping center and visible from the street after driving past, people who are in the know and support such an historic piece of SoCal culture will keep this burger joint open hopefully for years to come.  It is a little strange driving under a low lying and quite large billboard when going through the drive-thru.  And it is equally strange being in a long and narrow drive-thru along side a flood channel.  But the product within this strange complex is what I know and love as the Original Tommy's.  

I usally get the same order when I go.  I get a double cheese burger with everything.  That is a burger with two meat patties, cheese, rib sticking chili, a thick slice of tomato, diced onion, pickles and mustard.  Add some regular fries to scoop the chili drippings off the paper and you are set.

Some times I switch up my order a bit and get a chili tamale.  This is a tamale with chili and all the other fixin's from the burger.  It is almost every bit as good.  Worth a try.

13016,3,1547078400000,"When my son, who is three, had severe neck pain and was taken to the ER.   He was quickly admitted and multiple tests were taken to ensure this was not meningitis. From the moment we began our Presbyterian experience it was clear that the medical care was much less than excellent.  In the ER my son had to be stuck 4 times before the nurse could get the IV in properly.  (I happen to have two pediatric nurses in my husband's family  and they have verified that I should be appalled that my son had to endure this pain and stress upon entering the PEDIATRIC area.)
Once we got into our room it was two HOURS until my son was given his pain medication.  His pain was so severe that he had to be on morphine in order to tolerate his condition. For the next 48 hours he was on high doses of antibiotics and steroids, and after his first CT scan the doctors said that he needed his tonsils and adenoids taken out because they were infected.
In the second 24 hours his pain seemed to disappear completely and we saw the return of the happy kid that we are used to.  So, 24 hours later we were released on over the counter antibiotics for 10 days.
24 hours later we were back in the ER with the same excruciating pain in his neck again.  It seems like the doctor should have taken him off the steroids rather than release him with out knowing how his recovery was going.  The only tests used were the white cell count and CT scan. When the white cell count was normal we were released.
After our second admission to the hospital we had another CT scan done and were told it was absolutely necessary.  We were very concerned about the radiation exposure for our three-year-old boy. At this point the diagnosis was changed to an abscess in his lymph node. After 4 more days in the hospital, we were ready to get home and our son was in stable condition for the past 36 hours.  We could not get a answer from the doctors about what needed to happen before they knew he would be ready to be released.  So, they did another CT scan....the THIRD! Finally, my husband and I were so completely frustrated with the care and lack of competency of Doctor Mills, that we left the hospital, against doctor recommendation.
We drove back home to Atlanta and pulled into Children's Scottish Rite and were immediately met with competency, that we had become accustomed to over the last 3 years. 
The IV was put in, first time, the nurse did not shoot saline into my son's arm EVERY time a new antibiotic dose was administered. (Which was extremely painful for him every 4 hours at Hemby!) Additionally an IV was put in that the nurses tied off so that our three year old didn't have to lug around his IV bag constantly and he could sleep comfortably, play, use the bathroom, etc, without his IV being irritated with every move.
The first few hours we were there we saw a pediatric ENT who took a blood test and was able to determine the infection was in fact not gone yet.  There was NO need to have 3 CT scans, she didn't even have the medical records, because the doctor would not give them to us, until a day later, and even so had a measure that was useful to determine what level of infection was remaining.  We stayed the next 3 days at children's and we were blown away.",1

I like the masala chai very much (and they frequently offer refills!) We also love the chutney appetizer that is always provided before dinner. 

One warning is that the food is very spicy. I am sensitive to spice but can tolerate the ""medium"" spice level at most restaurants. The ""medium"" level at Maharaja is too hot for me.

13106,1,1548288000000,Excited to see the Lobster Truck at Smiths today at 12:30. Checked out the menu waiting for the person in front of me to finish ordering. I step up and he says he can't take my order. He's leaving. What???  No explanation.,2
13106,2,1547942400000,First visit and last visit. My meal was blah. Wonton soup with a smokey flavor? No way! Egg drop soup with corn? The server said their family always adds corn. Really? In the last 50 years of ordering egg drop soup corn has never been included. It might be their family favorite but most certainly not ours. Before ordering the orange beef the server was asked very specifically if it was spicy. Her response was not really. Her version of 'not really spicy' is quite different from my husband's. One bite of the orange beef and his mouth was screaming holy habanero! And the beef was tougher than shoe leather. We should have taken note of the nearly empty tables/booths. We now know why.,3

They serve classier takes on traditional American dishes and charge a premium for the nicer plating and everything. In my opinion the food's not worth the price. I've had the eggplant parmesan, duck pasta, and beef tartare. Eggplant parmesan doesn't come with any carbs and the salad underneath it doesn't absorb a lot of the oil that comes from it. It has a nice velvety texture though. Beef tartare has a good flavor but there's not a lot of bread that comes with it. The pasta I had was SALTY and made me really thirsty. I've also had a moscow mule, peach jazz, and king's ginger tonic. The moscow mule was good and was really refreshing. The peach jazz and king's ginger tonic had A LOT of alcohol and overwhelmed me a bit, but it's good for the price.",2

I've had the eggs benny, the veggie eggs benny, and the bacon+peanut-butter french toast. all are delicious. 

I wish they had more local(ish) beer. If I recall correctly, they have (on tap), Labatt 50, Pabst, and something called ""two armed stout"" or something like that. Where's the Creemore? Where's the Mill Street?

They have board games you can grab from the bar, and because the place is full of 21st century hipsters, you won't feel self-conscious playing ""Sorry!"" or whatever, because they will all think it's ironic.",1

Their color selection seems a bit smaller than some others I've been to, but there still seemed to be plenty to choose from. It's a smallish place that's not unpleasant but could use some more decor. There are multiple TV's to watch, if that's your thing, and all stations face them. I was put with Trish, who was polite and did a quick & efficient yet effective job; I think she had me done within an hour total, and I was happy with the way my nails turned out.",1

When ordering it can be annoying. They should ask if you are first visitor or not because all the questions are annoying. I know what I want just let me tell you it's much faster then you asking if each individual item is ok. I'm sure it may help with order accuracy but it just gets on my nerves.",2

The desserts sounded delicious but we were stuffed. Large burgers!! Prices maybe a bit high, but the freshness and quality made our meals worth the price.

The dim sum carts were flying all over the aisles.  Some carts will stop by to ask what you like and some fly by without getting you a chance to see what is available.  We had so many dishes, so I will only comments on the ones that I remember.

Pros:
Lai Bak Go (Taro Fried Cakes) - Warm, perfected fried on both sides, and tasty
Shu Mai (Dumplings) - Pretty large sizes, good taste, and warm
Char Sui Bao (Steamed BBQ Pork Buns) - BBQ was flavorful and steamed perfectly
Pork and Preserved Egg Rice Soup - OMG, good!!!
Gar Lear (Fried Bread wrapped with flat rice noodles) - Crispy bread, soft noodles, and mixed with the perfect soy sauce mixture

Con:
Black bean with spare ribs - flavorless and oily
White Snow Buns - Deflated and undone

13215,3,1547164800000,"One of my favourite places to go to for Korean food. I usually go Sunday for lunch since we're near that area and it's a bonus they have a lunch special. Prices have increased throughout the years (I go here a lot) but it's still pretty worth for the amount of food you get. I'm not a big fan of pork bone soup but I did try the soup base and it was quite flavourful. From the lunch special I always get the pork katsu deal which includes a slice of katsu, rice, 2 fried dumplings, black bean noodles (can place this with cham pong (seafood noodle soup) with $2 charge, salad, and a choice of drink (miso or pop). There's about 5 options you can choose from and differs in price. Next to the lunch menu, I would only get soft tofu with dumplings in it as I'm not a fan of seafood and the rest of the soft tofu dishes were seafood. The soup is spicy. I love spicy so it's at a good level for me to enjoy. There's about 2-3 dumplings in it and a lot of veggies (kimchi and onions) mostly. It comes with a side of rice and I usually get purple rice. This dish is.. rather pricey. $13.50 but it wouldn't stop me from getting the same thing haha. 
It's easy to split the bills and accepts cash/debit/credit. 

Came here again for lunch and instead of getting the lunch special, I got the combo for one person. There's 6 options but I picked the one that came with black bean noodle and a side of dumplings. Dumplings are always great here. They're fried but not crispy crispy? weird ain't it. Kinda like no flakes or anything but it's crisp haha. 
Black bean noodles are always my fav here. Hands down fav place",2

AND the server didn't even bother to ask how was our meals, refill drinks or refill bread?! But rest assured they automatically add 18% gratuity even though I think they didn't deserved it. Check totaled $97 for four adults.

It was seriously some of the best pizza I've had. Maybe they made changes to their pizza but right now it is spot on. 

I also really like the decor here. I'm from the country so the very rustic old barn wood they use to decorate looks really cool. Wish I could have a cabin or house like this. Very cool on the inside for being in a strip mall.",2

I either get their 1/2 sandwich and soup special or salad... you get to chose from any sandwich (turkey and avocado is always great) on the menu and the soup special or a garden salad or Cesar salad.  perfect amount of food.  I also really like their salads... I have had the salmon and cous cous salad which is great and the Chicken and Gorgonzola salad which is also very good.  The reason they did not get 5 stars is because sometimes their service is pretty slow... i have a feeling this is due to the lunch rush.",2

After a week of what seems to be Murphy's Law at every turn, the unthinkable happened; I dropped my iPhone and the screen shattered.  Already feeling defeated and having to make a difficult journey the next morning I looked to my husband to help me fix my screen, it was 7:45pm and no Apple appointments were available for at least 2 days.  As tears streamed down my face some amazing employees really made my night their names are Joseph and Joshua at the Arrowhead Mall location in Glendale, AZ.  Sadly, no last names were given for these common names but I am forever grateful for their kindness, skill, and understanding.  They stayed after the store was closed to switch out my screens.
  I don't claim to be a techie by any means.  I'm the person that unplugs and plugs the computer/electronics/anything with a plug to see if I can fix the problem, but being a former teacher, I do understand people and Joseph and Joshua are top notch folks.

Appetizers - We normally alternate between getting the veggie egg rolls or the pot stickers. They have always been nice and crispy. Never soggy which I find happens a lot when I order take out from other restaurants. 
We have on occasion ordered the Thai dumplings and they are delicious as well but it's just a matter of personal preference! 
For entrees I alternate between yellow curry and green curry - Both are delicious but be warned if you don't specify how spicy you want it you could end up getting a hot surprise! With take out though I've noticed they normally include the spice on the side for you to mix in  yourself! My personal favorite is the green curry with chicken and extra vegetables! Can never go wrong. 
If you're in the mood for something else though the pad thai is delicious as well. I normally get it with mild spice and chicken. Its a generous portion size so you will be full ! 

Only ever tried dessert once - We got the sticky rice with mango - it was good but it is a very very sweet dish. The rice is soaked in a sweet white syrup that tastes kind of like coconut - the mango that came in the dish though was delicious and ripe!

Very nice wine selection, including an 06 Stags Leap petite syrah and a very fair price on Silver Oak Cabernet. Our side dishes included marinated mushrooms and a loaded baked potato, both were amazing, but way too much after such a large cut of beef.!! Service was really great and this is the only good thing about the NY NY. Overall A+",2
13344,3,1548374400000,"I have to say I love food, especially American-Mexican burritos, just not here.

 I got the Joey with organic tofu and the make your own subway style burrito build. I have to say I was highly unimpressed with the quality of the ingredients and the freshness of the veggies. I thought the entire burrito felt fake.

The one plus though that allowed me to give this place 3 stars was the salsa bar! OMG... the pineapple salsa was so good, I suggest you do try that if you do end up here. 

Also the coke machine is one of those freestyle machines so you can mix and match and make your own fun new concoctions. 

Overall I will not go back, but if I am forced I'll stick to the chips and salsa.",2

We waited way over 45 minutes for overpriced & small 12 wings and a turkey sandwich. Their food is fine but this was unacceptable.
Last time we came, no one sat us for 10 minutes and my boyfriend had to go search out for someone to seat us. Again, food was fine but this restaurant is not organized.

A lot of good wing sauces to choose from and nice server though.",2

I was able to get a jump-start and get to their location, not only did they sell the battery to me, they were able to let me know about a $20 coupon that I was able to apply to my purchase. They even  installed the battery for me. They did all of this while being very kind and courteous. The first sales person was able to take the battery out for me and at that point the store started to get busy so the second salesperson took over and installed the battery for me. I was in and out of there in 20 minutes. The crazy part of this story is that they kept thanking me for being patient while they were simultaneously answering questions for other customer's as they entered the store. NO thank you to you two for dealing with  the outdoor elements while you installed the battery and making my visit  quicker and less expensive then my other options.",2

Some time later, we finally returned for dinner. The food was pretty good (chicken and waffles and short ribs) and our drinks were OK, but not spectacular. Our server was sweet, but the place was full and she couldn't get around to everyone in a reasonable amount of time. A place the size of Harlem Underground should have at least two servers on the floor. 

The space is sort of dark and mysterious. There's a large open window at the front, which allows for some good people watching.",2

Food was phenomal !! We tried quite a bit off the menu (thanks to corporate Amex) and the stand outs were the 4 meat burger, duck sandwich, chicken sandwich, housemade pickles, chickpea fries, and the watermelon salad.

One of the places we went to was the park.  What a great place to spend the afternoon.

They have the coolest little cave rock structures here.  If I was homeless I would sneak in here and sleep at night.

My husband brought his trials bike and was jumping on them.  They are really cool.

Plenty of play structures and swing sets for children to play on.

There was a family having a birthday party here.  They were using the barbeque's and all of the picnic tables are under awnings.  I can imagine sitting in the sun in the Phoenix summer while eating a hot dog isn't the most enjoyable thing.

They had sand in the play area.  A dad and his two little girls were building a really cool sand castle.  I took a picture of it.  I don't like sand because cats poop in it at night.  That was the only bad thing about it.

Every time we're in Vegas (once or twice a month) my boys will always want go to Kids Quest so my wife and I can have our time to play and have fun.

The rates are great about $9 an hour per kid, worth the money if you're winning too, hahaha!  This particular location has an iPad and a basketball court.  And, they provide food and drink if you give them an allowance during their stay.

13416,1,1548288000000,"here is my story, i read all 150 reviews on yelp, and since i have found another salon that was really good, i wanted to try this one, I wish i didn't! so i booked with Aaron, super friendly guy but failed to accomplish what i wanted. 

So i wanted all golden tones or warmth removed from my hair  ( hair is super dark), and wanted ash all over. We have done a consultation and we clearly understood each other.  He explained to me that i have to pay $250 cuz i needed a colour correction apparently and treatment because of my damaged hair and something else. I'm like ok, and i bought a group on voucher for a hair cut, which includes a treatment, yet when i asked Aaron about that, he was like oh you still need to pay $250, so plus 39.99 voucher, thats $290.00 without tax!! I'm like thats ok after hearing all these amazing reviews i completely trusted him and wanted him to be my hair stylist. unfortunately when the day came, my hair was gold, NO ASH whatsoever, and while the balyage was nice where it fell, the colour was exactly what I DIDNT WANT! and for a second i didn't even notice the difference from my previous look to my new look! and when i pointed that out, the hair dresser who was cutting my hair was like oh its a cool brown, and let me tell you something she was LYING in my face! 

So overall, i wanted to get it fixed, and he was ok with that, both times i ended up coming in late because i came all the way from Mississauga, and the transit is so bad in my area, where i would leave  2 hours earlier because i have to take the subway, and on top of that the last time i was supposed to come i took a cab that cost me $70 and was stuck in traffic, both appointments were in the morning,and both times they could NOT accommodate me despite once i was only late 15 min, other salons would say we can't give you a blow dry or something, but none of that was offered! just simply we can't take you! you gotta reschedule and he is not able to take a booking till the next week! so finally when i spoke to their rude receptionist Victoria, she was being so rude when she was telling me we can not take you in, and i told her ok when can i book again, she is like well i don't know if they will be able to take you next time! IM LIKE ARE U SERIOUS??? YOU JUST MESSED UP MY HAIR AND GAVE ME EVERY WARM SHADE THAT I DIDNT WANT IN MY HAIR AND NO ONE NOTICED I EVEN DID SOMETHING TO MY HAIR BECAUSE IT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE THE SAME HAIR COLOUR PREVIOUSLY AND I PAID OVER $330 TO GET TOLD THAT THEY MAY NOT EVEN TAKE YOU BECAUSE YOU SHOWED UP LATE TWICE, DESPITE THE FACT WHEN I DID MY APPOINTMENT WITH AARON HE WAS LATE WITH A CLIENT AND I DIDNT CARE!

13418,1,1548288000000,"The sushi and hibachi here is DELICIOUS. You cannot beat this price either! You get actual service-to and from your table-not the buffet style where anyone can sneeze all over your dinner & etc. the sushi is in normal portions and truly unlimited for 2 hours, the lobster is actual lobster and the ginger dressing tastes housemade and is so good. There is only one catch to the all you can eat 2 hours-if you have excessive food waste they will charge you $10.99/lbs for EXCESSIVE food waste. Example: you order one of everything and you eat 1/4 of your order, you will be charged $10.99 per pound for everything you didn't eat. If you leave a few bites/a reasonable amount behind you won't be charged. You can't take anything home if it is from the all you can eat buffet either.

We called later that night to complain( we are pretty easygoing so this Is something we never do). The employee on the phone offered us a free half dozen donuts and explained that she would write down our names for us to come back in the next day. So we come back and the manager, Leslie, told us she can't just hand out ""free stuff"" with a smirk on her face. We almost felt like we were being bullied by these two employees,  and no Leslie, we are not looking for ""free stuff"", we can afford donuts. Leslie humiliated us and basically called us liars.

Ordered Chilled Mango (M) for $6.50.
The ice cream is smooth and portion size is good. Didn't taste or see the pomelo pieces and the coconut milk syringe doesn't add much flavour. Mango chunks can be more sweet. They use the fresh mangoes for Mango Popice. 

They make the ice cream on the spot with Kitchen Aid and liquid nitrogen. N2 is poured on the ice cream right at serving for the full effect.

You can order the Frozen Breath, which is a cup of Cheetos with liquid nitrogen. When you eat the Cheetos cold air will come out of your nose and mouth.

Our waiter, Jerry, was absolutely amazing - so friendly and attentive, he made us both feel welcome and comfortable.

The food was absolutely amazing, we both couldn't get over how tender and flavorful the chicken was. I'm usually a big baby about spicy things but the complimentary salsa was perfect for both my husband (who loves spicy items) and I. We were so impressed that we were offered refills as well.

We aren't usually dessert people but couldn't resist the fried ice cream and we were so pleased that we kept talking about it all evening.

Finally, the margaritas: for $1.00 more you can add flavor and at Jerry's suggestion, I went with a strawberry-mango one. It tasted like a smoothie! So delicious. 

I'm so glad I finally have something to look forward to on a Monday. Thank you, Patron!",2

This doesn't come down to the employee, this comes down to poor management not training and watching the work being performed. If the owner or corporation is reading these complaints posted, try going back to old school management and train your staff.

The shower would flood our bathroom since there was only one panel of glass covering half of the shower. The front desk was super nice and helpful with all of our questions and concerns.

But I can say that I never really can see this place serving food. The building it's self is two big rooms. There is a upstairs seating area as well to hang out or just look down at people. The prices are what you would expect for southside. There's not really any great specials on drinks. There's not really any entertainment here as far as pool or darts goes. It gets crowded fast on the weekends even with being such a big area. There is a shot wheel for the daring to risk what they will get. The dj usually plays bangers to get the crowd hyped up but also hits you with the unexpected. The bathrooms here suck and are usually dirty and going down the steps is extremely cramped to the basement. The staff are friendly from experiences I've had here in the past. Overall if I'm in the southside I don't go out of my way to come here but I'll likely return with friends.,2

That being said, I don't expect trendy socialite type girls to be buying anything from this store.  This is definitely a Hip-Hop centric store.  

The space that this boutique occupies in the otherwise awful Arizona Center is cool, clean, and filled with awesome local art.  Lalo Cota is most certainly favored in here.  Most of the clothing in here is limited to T-Shirts and hoodies for men while the women have a bit more to choose from.  Along the front of the store are locally designed dresses, skirts, and blouses.  A lot of stuff in here is styled like graffiti, which is definitely very cool.  They even carry a small selection of one of a kind graffitied shoes that are done during their Shoe Shows.  You will also find lots of Phoenix-centric shirts, a personal favorite of mine.

If this is your style, you can't pass this place by.  With low prices and quality merchandise, Culture Fresh is a shining example of what the Arizona Center should be filled with as opposed to empty spaces and personality-free gift shops.",3

13599,1,1547942400000,"My husband and I visited this Hickory Tavern location for the first time tonight, being only 5 minutes from our new place.  We were looking for good oysters.  We received the exact opposite!  Besides being filled with the common iodine taste I get when served at other Hickory Taverns (or something they obviously use to keep them fresh), I had to put a napkin to my mouth for almost half of 8 I attempted to eat.  They were rotten, as if they had been sitting, opened shell and dead.  Don't go there for oysters at all!  We wish we'd gone to Big Daddy's, Full Moon or Pearlz... these 3 are top and we've never had this type of experience with any of them.  I don't leave comments except in exceptional cases.  I want to make certain you avoid our mistake.  On the positive side, the customer service was great.",2

This might be one of the better options on Mill Ave. My sis and I ordered 6 different tacos to sample, ranging from soft tortillas with shredded chicken to crunchy shells with shrimp. The tacos were tasty, although it would have been nice to add some salsa or spice to them to make the meal a tad bit more unique (salsa bar, anyone?!). We did have to wait a while for our meal but that could also be the beer talking.",1

They have extensive alcohol options as well with wine, beer, and cocktails. Centrally located and easy to find! Highly recommend!",2
13608,1,1546732800000,"Another yummy meal at Bouchon.  I've been to the original in Yountville years ago and to this one as well about 2 years ago.  They did it again, although I must say that my previous visit had a bit of an edge on this one.  Maybe it was because last time I was part of a party of 10, therefore able to sample a wide variety of foods.  Also, last time I had the lovely foie gras terrine which was CREAMY, RICHNESS, CLOG YOUR ARTERIES DELICIOUSNESS!  I couldn't order it this time since there were only 2 of us and both of us would have had instant heart attacks if I had!  So back to this visit:  Started off with a half dozen of my favorite creamy oysters from the Northwest, is there a better way to begin a meal?  I had the duck breast which was the perfect ratio of fat to juicy meat and I, unlike some of you yelpers, enjoyed the orange sauce that accompanied it!  It is duck a la orange after all...The special peeky-toe crab salad was excellent, even if it was on the miniscule side.  And the classic chicken was simply cooked to perfection.  Yes, the bread here is near perfection and we ate every last bite of it!  Finished with the three bites of brownies with tin dollops of mint, chocolate, and carmel ice cream-the perfect ending.  

Only complaint here was that the restaurant was not that busy, so it took away from the usual energy of the place.",2

The food was just like we had it the first time.  I had the magic shroom burger  my husband had the llano poblano and we shared the Parmesan truffle fries. The Angus beef patty was cook medium rear and the combination of the condiments was a tasy perfection brewing in my mouth.  My eldest son had the classic burger with cheese and an Oreo milk shake. My youngest had the continental club with a stout chocolate shake and they both shared an order of the kennebec fries. Needles to say we all walked out with a smile.
As for the service, it was AWESOME right from the start we were greeted and assisted in the process. Throughout dinner we were asked if we need anything else.  If you haven't tried it stop by.",2
13615,3,1548806400000,The food is delicious and authentic (and I was born and raised in New Orleans). We had the shrimp poboy and the bread is from New Orleans. The gumbo and onion rings were  great. I highly recommend it.,3

We ordered the mushrooms and the fries from the bar snack menu. Both are amazing! Must tries! Both were bigger portions than anticipated so if you order more, plan on the smaller plates. My husband had the perogies-he said it they were so good, a fresh take on perogies. I had which I had no room, the chicken and waffles. The sweet potato waffles paired so nicely with the chicken breasts and the crispy Brussels sprouts. The pure Ohio 
 maple syrup just made the entire meal!!! I had to eat as much as I could fit :) you won't go wrong with these recommendations! Enjoy",2

Read: zero flight etiquette and crew making stupid jokes attempting to make up for being an hour late that make my walmart shopper-filled plane snicker.  But i digress. Plenty o etiquette at this place. Sat at the bar. Jazz and latin over the speakers. Bartenders as they should be. Dressed in white with black vests. Attentive. Quick. On point. Not pushy. Got the menu. Ordered the french dip which did not disappoint. Good, crunchy on the edges bread...rare beef on the inside. Mmmmm. Didn't mind the spiced-mayo stuff that came with it.  Had the broccolini with parmesan and sauteed onions. Very good. Nobody slapped the check on my table two seconds after i stopped chewing. Respectful-like, see?  So, french dip is very good. The ceviche looked fantastic, too. Service was perfect. I will come here again. No longer mad because of my delay...belly-full and at peace.  Thanks, Chelsea.",2

13625,3,1548374400000,"I am so glad J-Town finally opened up some restaurants in the area. I frequented this restaurant with my aunt and loved the authentic Japanese food. The concept of an Izakaya is almost one of a Trattoria for Italians and this place is no exception. The food is exceptional.

I have been here for lunch and dinners and the atmosphere is really one of a Diner Dash game with one or two waitresses serving guests and a few cooks in the open kitchen. Izakaya Ju does not feature your typical Spider and California rolls, but rather, tapas items such as Tongue, Pork Cheek, Conch, Spicy Tuna Sashimi, Gindara slice, and BC Tuna. All the dishes are meant to be shared. My ALL TIME FAVE lunch dish is the Beef Curry with rice which is delish, filling and not expensive.

I was here for dinner and arrived at 8:30pm and the place was packed. We were lucky that one table just finished making room for us. In addition to the regular menu, the restaurant features specials written on the chalk board. I suggest you to try the stuff on the board. The food here is so good and fresh.

For tonight, I ordered a 720ml bottle of sake which comes in at $75 as the cheapest 720ml option. There is some black bottle at $150...in other words, sake is not cheap here. That being said, we ordered the sake of a ""1000 Long Lives"" and it was the hardest, heavenliest, sake I have ever tried. Well worth the $75 bucks.

FYI! When you order the chicken balls, look for the dedicated cook who is responsible for fanning the fire to make the chicken tender and juicy (in order to have that great BBQ taste).

All in all, I love this restaurant. There is another restaurant beside that has a mostly ramen/noodle menu so depending on what you fee like, you will not be disappointed. The place is small, but service is very homely and the food is so, SO, very good.",2
13630,1,1547856000000,"We have been wanting to check out this spot for a while now! Extremely happy that we finally did! The view is just amazing from there we got to enjoy the water show across the street that happens at Bellagio. They have all sorts of games for you to play like jenga, pool, connect four, beer pong etc. The only thing we were missing was some music to dance to.

The food was really good! I enjoyed the beer park pie! The Mac and cheese in there was delicious. My wife enjoyed her popcorn chicken but the fries here are addicting so be careful! The drinks were so delicious. I tried the park tea and Moscow mule which is definitely the best I've ever had! I enjoyed that there wasn't an over pour and I could actually enjoy it! But they also weren't skimpy drinks. My wife enjoyed creating beer flights to be able to taste a lot of the options. 

Now I'm saving the best for last! The customer service was beyond amazing!!!!! Our bartender was Alyssa who was so friendly and super funny! She was attentive all night even when she started getting super busy. Thank you for such a great night for my wife's birthday! This will definitely be a bar that we visit often!",1
13634,3,1547078400000,"This place is absolutely amazing. The minute you get to the parking lot you can already smell how great this food is. We started with feta cheese and pita bread and it was probably some of the best feta I've ever had. The best part is that they make their feta cheese fresh so you know it's not from some container they bought at the local store. I ended up getting the shish kabob, which essentially is the lamb kabob and it was out of this world. Perfectly cooked and served with a huge portion of rice and salad that was also great. The portions are great, atmosphere is cool, and the service very friendly. This is a place you need to check out especially if you're a first timer to middle eastern food!",2

During a routine physical, my doctor (well, physician assistant, but she knows her stuff!) caught some things that could have been easily passed over. She also pushed me to get additional tests and found something serious that could have been easily missed. She also addressed all the minor issues that I brought up, too! Just really thankful to be going here.

Everyone here is friendly, willing to help, and I actually look forward (or at least don't dread) going to get checkups here.

My biggest issue is how short the appointments are and how long it takes to get an appointment (over a month for my initial appointment), but I think that has more to do with the lack of general physicians nation-wide than any particular failing of GHC specifically.",2

Both drinks pleased our palette perfectly.  For dinner I had the mushroom tacos (being a vegetarian that was the go to option) and my husband had the al pastor tacos - simply put, amazing. Finally, for dessert we had the whipped cheesecake. After leaving we both talk about the complex food profiles of everything we had that made the food so one of a kind and desirable.

13654,1,1546732800000,"We stayed here 3 nights, as did most of the out-of town guests for the wedding we attended.   Yes, I'm a stay in a hostel type of person, but it was fun to be in the same spot as family and friends.

The room was clean and obviously remodeled.   As I think has already been mentioned, the room had a separate room with a pull out couch and kitchenette (mini-fridge with freezer, microwave), and a separate bedroom.   We joked that everyone had their own sink between the bathroom sink, the kitchen sink, and the sink and vanity in the bedroom.   There was a flat-screen tv in both the bedroom and sitting area.    I appreciated the extra blankets in the closet as my sis and other half were delighted to set the air con to ice cream.

The complimentary breakfast was pretty extensive, although mostly full of unhealthy, processed food.    I had made-to -order omelets, and there was a paltry selection of fruit.   

The free happy hour was well-attended.   I was excited about the spread of snacks, since I am off the alcohol, and when my husband said he saw Tostitos being opened, I thought he was joking, but no, it was there accompanying melted cheese-like dip.   But, it was free, and I am sure there was real food in the restaurant if I really needed it.   If you timed it right, all you would need to eat outside of what was provided by the Embassy Suites was a light lunch and maybe evening snacks.

The employees were so genuinely nice, and it didn't matter what role they were in.   I don't know if that is a company wide policy, but management needs to be commended.",2

Went to this store ar12:33 PM today. What a disaster. The fish tasted like chicken, the fries tasted like chicken, the hush puppies (which were under cooked and doughy) tasted like chicken. All of it tasted like the oil was old and over used.  The crab cake tasted like salmon. No excuse for this. The table was dirty and even after being wiped down twice had food and gunk left on it. Both me and my friend both barely made it to a toilet with the runs after eating there. Stay away if you value your health and taste buds.",3
13660,2,1548806400000,"Saw Fitz and the Tantrums here last week and this was my first time at The Mod Club. I was expecting it to be a little bit grungy inside (like most small venues) but to my surprise it was quite clean and pretty modern. Seating with a few tables along one wall and a long bar on the other wall. The ceilings are quite high making this place feel very spacious for a smaller venue and there is a nice balcony, which I assume is for VIP's. 
 
The site lines are pretty good and with a venue like this you are usually able to get pretty close to the stage. The sound quality was OK but not spectacular. The crowd was mostly young people and was quite energetic (this can be credited to Fitz and the Tantrums as they did a good job of getting the crowd into it). 
 
This place gets bonus marks for having a few local beers and being within walking distance from Ossington subway station, making it very easy to get to.  I would be happy to return to this venue for another show. 

*Pro-tip: Take a walk down Ossington towards Dundas and have a few pre-concert beers at Bellwoods Brewery those guys make amazing beers! Cheers!",2

13667,1,1547769600000,"I absolutely would not recommend PODS to anyone unless you have a small amount of furniture/boxes.  When I ordered the POD I told the woman that we had a lot of boxes and furniture and I was concerned the POD would not be big enough.  We had a two bedroom apartment and she assured me the size (the largest) would be fine - it could fit up to four rooms of furniture she said.  I told her I had some bureaus and a large entertainment center and she said it would be fine.  When the POD driver delivered the POD, I again told him I did not think the POD was big enough and he said ""you would be surprised at how much can fit on one of these"".  When the mover arrived the next day, his first words were ""all of your stuff is not going to fit"".  I was moving across country and needed to leave the next day.  This had all been scheduled and organized perfectly!  But when I called PODS in a panic to get another POD delivered, and was told I could not get another POD for 4 days, I thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown.  We had to use ABF Freight, at an additional cost of $3,100 plus an additional cost of $600 for the mover to load the ABF freight at the warehouse, after my husband had to go and get a UHaul truck because the mover of course did not have a truck with him because he and his crew were loading everything on to the POD.

But from the moment we sat down, the service was slow and the food took 50 minutes to be served. The restaurant was not busy what so ever, so there was NO excuse. Just another example of a restaurant  with poor to no management. It seemed like the place was being run by a bartender, on waiter, and a cook..... So much potential, but they don't take their fine establishment seriously. The ""bottomless"" Bloody Mary seemed to be mostly mix, next to no vodka.",1

13679,3,1547856000000,"I chose this doctor largely due to his online ratings and his proximity to my home was a bonus. Needless to say I left the appointment in tears.  First, he refused to discuss alternative birth control methods due to my weight. I have hypothyroidism and am estrogen dominant which causes me to be overweight. Being on the pill for the better part of 14 years has also contributed to weight gain which is part of why I want to stop taking it. I assured him I eat a plant based diet and exercise regularly and my overall (good) health reflects my lifestyle choices. This fell on deaf ears. 
Next, the actual pap smear was awful. I was pretty tense after being made to feel on the defensive and not even humored with a discussion about the reasons I was in his office. This led to a painful pap- something I didn't even know was possible. I was pretty tense and did not have a chance to relax before the speculum was inserted. On top of this let's just say his method for obtaining the pap also more resembled vigorous tooth brushing. 
Upon leaving the staff had went ahead and scheduled me an appointment for next year without my consent and there are signs stating you will be charged for missed appointments. I promptly canceled the appointment.",1

It's a shame really because we live down the street and desperately want to be be frequent customers but I cannot justify it longer. The management/service is probably the worst I have seen in the food industry. I'm not a negative yelper EVER, ho ahead and look, but I am doing this to help the biz out. I do not expect a response because I mean, they don't even care in person, but should somehow someone tell me that there's new management, I may consider dropping by solely for the food.

Every time since the first, I have gone and purchased the burrito only to find out that they were out of guac AFTER I had received it. I went back and asked what happened to the guac in the burrito and I would get an apologetic ""We're out"" but there was no make up for the fact that they hadn't alerted me they were out prior to paying for the burrito.

Anyway....this dinner was the best dinner we have ever had in Vegas. My mother in law and I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. Wow. It was fabulous!! The ever so tasty fish laid on top of a delicious pile of rock shrimp rissoto, topped with bruschetta. We're slightly sea bass snobs and this one tied for first place in my book. My husband and his dad ordered the waygu beef short rib. It was extremely tender and tasty with a side of candy striped beets that tasted like they were fresh out of the garden! And the price was unheard of! For the sides, we ordered the garlic mash potatoes, green beans and mushrooms. Holy moly, the mushrooms mixed with the steak or even the mash potatoes....to absolutely die for!!!! The green beans were fresh and crisp to perfection. Since we were celebrating a birthday for my father in law, we opted for dessert. The waiter recommended these little donut holes, injected with nutella with a side of peanut butter/coconut sauce and a side of strawberry sauce. Seriously.

In looking further at the one and two star reviews several things stand out.  One is the complaint about the quantity of food and the other is the price. First, this is not Outback or Applebee's, so if you want huge portions so that you can become the 60% of Americans who are fat and obese, this is not the place for you.  This is after all a Japanese restaurant and the value is placed on quality over quantity. 

As for the price, you are paying for the quality of the ingredients and the quality of the service. The menu with pricing is available before you enter the restaurant and before you place your order, so don't act surprise at the price.  Too expensive?  Go to Chili's or McDonald's then.

I went here for dinner on a monday night and the place was still lively! I actually ran into some friends.  So apparently I really like Caribbean food which is a nice surprise! This isn't a huge stretch given I love zesty seafood. 

We started with the scallops.  The portion was small (only two) but the eggplant ""salad"" underneath was delish. I had the tuna which was the high point! Sometimes I can get overwhelmed with all of the sauces, rubs, creams but this dish did it right! Tuna, black beans, potato fitters... yum! 

Pros: lively ambiance, delicious food, interesting menu, strong dark n stormy's, attentive service. 

Cons: Might be become a bit pricey if you are drinking and eating.

13735,3,1547769600000,"Amazing! We were staying at the Wynn and Joel Robuchon had a limo waiting for us to take us to our 6pm reservation. We were led through a private courtyard that served as a perfect background for pictures.

As we entered the restaurant, we noticed that the decor was extravagant and beautiful. Purple plush love seats with the decor matching the season.

My girls and I each decided to do the 6 course tasting menu for $195 since we knew that the 16 course would overwhelm us. The sommelier was extremely knowledgable and introduced us to some wines that suited our palette perfectly.

The bread cart was absolutely divine! Every restaurant should have a selection like that. Although they had a total of about 20 different types of breads, our favorite was the gyuere cheese brioche, the milk bread, the wheat miniture baguette, and the bacon bread. The bread was warmed up for us and we were served butter ""the classic french way,"" cut from a huge block of butter on a cold marble slab and dusted with sea salt.

Our amuse-bouche was caviar over a white grape gelatin over crab mixed with cream of fennel. It was divine! The flavors melded well and the hints of fennel gave the dish a different layer of sophistication.

My appetizer was clams with seaweed butter garnished with caviar and a buckwheat crisp. It was delicious, I will never see clams the same way again.

Our soup was a creamy chestnut soup served with bacon infused foam, with bits of bacon and foie gras in the bottom of the dish. It was heaven. Never in my life have I had such a perfectly cooked piece of foie gras.

My two main courses consisted of duck with foie gras and braised veal cheeks in a Thai broth. Both were also delish. Everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. Beyond that though, the flavors went extremely well together - perfectly thought out dishes. I now know the title of ""chef of the century"" is well-deserved.

Our cheese course was also divine - too many to remember, but all wonderful to tease your palette with.

My dessert was a melting chocolate cake with infused foam and coffee ice cream. It was the best chocolate dessert I have ever had. 

Finally, the chocolate cart - all made on the premises by the pastry chef - just exquiste. How do I even describe that 15 mins of heaven. 

The was a parting gift from the pastry chef and our food adventure seemed like it ended as soon as it began with a ride back to Wynn in the limo, rubbing our tummies as we discussed what we will have the next time we are back here.

Merci and J t'aime Joel Robuchon!",1

She is incredibly personable and thoughtful in every aspect of her individual work and in the operation of her clinic. Her attention to detail and follow through is fantastic. My animals feel welcome in her clinic and even the rooms and clinic spaces are a reflection of her caring attitude. She is very fair in her pricing, is up on current research and practices, and uses/refers to holistic vets and other local experts. She is  very skilled with animal handling and the surgeries we have had have been so well done that our special dogs and cats have done really well  soon afterwards and in the long term, too.

The place is beautiful inside with it's ridiculously high ceilings, massive pieces of artwork along the walls and floor to ceiling windows that line one side of the restaurant.  Love the atmosphere. 

I came here and had the following: 
- fried squid that came with aioli and a red pepper dip (pretty good but standard)
- piquillo peppers stuffed with oxtail & manchego (lovely, the oxtail was tender and the manchego gave it a melt in your mouth texture)
- fideo pasta with clams & chorizo with a huge dollop of aioli that was mixed in at the table by the server (this was delicious but not your standard ""pasta"" it's not saucy so you have to re-set your expectation if that's what you're thinking). I asked for chili flakes which the server misunderstood and provided chili sauce, which was even better!  The chili sauce is delicious, not on the vinegary side and slightly sweet.  I'd get it just to compliment any dish. 
- broccolini with almond garlic gazpacho & garlic chips (perfectly sauteed and the gazpacho was good but didn't taste like almonds, I couldn't figure out what it exactly tasted like)
- lemon mousse olive oil cake - yummeh!  Not too sweet, a bit on the dense side for mousse but I enjoyed it. 
- churros - can't go wrong with churros and the dulce de leche makes it that much better

13802,2,1548892800000,"Let me first start off saying this place is a good place however some items on the menu are awesome (corned beef) and some are not so awesome, Western Bacon Burger.

The menu says fresh ground beef which I believe it is but it is not an in house made burger patty.  You can tell when a patty is put together in house and from one purchased as an already made fresh ground patty.

I am not saying it was horrible because it was not, but I have had way better burgers at places I will share with you if interested if you contact me, I will not post names here and this burger was just ok.  It is something I can now say been there, done that.  

Next time I will try something else I have not had here before and we will see.  Like I said in the beginning, the corned beef sandwich I had last time I was here was amazing.  The menu has a decent selection of foods and you should go there.

Please understand when it comes to the burger and this review, this is my personal opinion and feeling which means if you like burgers, give it a try and write a review with your opinion.",2

Dirty tables, dirty floor, messy drink station; it was foul. Secondly, our food took forever.  I'd understand if the place was packed, but there was only one order ahead of mine.  Then, when my burro finally did come, it was just sitting there on the plate by itself; no chips, no garnish.  Just the burro!  I bit into it & the tortilla was hard and almost cold.  I have never had a ""hard"" burro in my life, and I'm hoping never to have one again; it's not a good thing.

The Carmen paella was definitely worth the wait. We enjoyed every little bit of it, even scraped the pan a little. The shrimp was so soft it felt like heaven, and the rice was covered in sauce coming directly from those seafood.

To be honest, I hadn't really been trying hard to find it. I'd just occasionally walk into a Sunrise or whatever movie store I might come across in my travels to see if it was there. Happened to be around Bay that day and remembered that this place existed.

I was extremely encouraged to see the system they had set up to handle buying and renting videos (shelves full of covers of movies with white and red tags velcro'd onto them; you took the white to the counter if you wanted to buy a movie and the red if you wanted to rent it). 

Their collection of the Criterion Collection was hugeeeee. I was so happy to see so many of them all together in one place.

13875,1,1547769600000,"I have found my new spot for a simple romantic night. This is a little hidden gem in Vegas. And thank you Yelp for informing me of this place. And also thank you restaurant.com for the coupons for this place. (which i forgot to bring for the occasion, but it will come in handy when I go back)

I had set up for an early Valentine's Day and Anniversary dinner here with the bf on a Wednesday evening. Our reservation was at 5:30pm. I had planned it that way in hopes to see the sunset from the wonderful outdoor seating at the lake. But we were too busy admiring the restaurant, wine, and food to notice the sunset. But that's okay. I picked a wednesday for an early celebration because I figured it would be quieter and they had live jazz. Which the gentleman was very nice and I liked his music selection.

So when we arrived, the hostess was very welcoming. After getting seated (we were the only table in that section at the time), the server told us if we wanted a bottle of wine to pick any out and just bring it back to the table, and so we did. The pricing is great for bottles.

The restaurant is quite nice. When you enter through the double glass sliding doors, you enter into the wine shop and bar area. There is 3 sections of seating, 1 area inside and 2 areas outside.

So for the first course, we ordered the ""Bacchus"". It looked different from the one I saw in the pictures posted here... so I posted my own. It was quite nice, with the lobster salad, different cheeses, and other stuff that I don't remember the names of. It came with a small basket of bread, which definitely was not enough for us so we had asked for another basket. It was yummy.

For the main course I could not decide for a while because I really wanted to try everything! But I ended up ordering the Lobster Pot Pie because that is their signature item, and the original plan since I had looked at their menu before we went. And the bf went with Moule Frites.

I was slightly disappointed that the frites were just regular fries and not the thinner ones like what they have at Mon Ami Babi. Oh well, still good. The flavor of the moules (mussels) were great. They were cooked perfectly and you can really taste the wine through the dish. It was great to dip the bread in it also. Mmmm

And my pot pie. I was told it was similar to Michael Mina. It was very rich and had lots of spinach. Good amount of lobster as well. I liked that their was corn in it. Picture of the item has been posted. The small metal pot that it was served it was topped with a cute round pastry puff. Very flakey. 

While enjoying the appetizer, the server had asked us if we wanted the bread pudding. It mentions on the menu it takes half an hour to make so I went ahead and ordered that too. Came out just in time. And the flavor of the dessert was amazing. It was very strong in scent and taste of cinnamon which I love. And there were raisins.

Overall a fantastic experience. A small menu, but with plenty of good options. I nice hidden gem.

And on the drive home I realized how close it was to our house, so I will definitely be going back soon. Probably to try their lunch cause it seems the items are completely different. And it would be a completely different feel. This place is great with service, food, and price. Worth a try :)",1

13879,2,1546992000000,"Originally, my review was for 1 star because I had an issue with communication in the billing department regarding my refund. Since then, the issue has been addressed. The billing manager did call me and explain the process of how refunds work and apologized for the inconvenience. The very nice marketing manager also personally delivered the check to my house which I really appreciated. He also assured me the employee I had trouble with was spoken to. 
I'm still not so happy I had to deal with this billing process to begin with. I was told that my insurance did not cover anything when actually it covered the majority of the bill. I did ask the woman the first time I went there if they could send me a bill after everything was billed through the insurance. She told me they could not. I would prefer to not have to cough up all sorts of money up front then wait a month or so to get my money back. 
The whole ordeal has caused me a lot of stress. As much as I would like to rate this higher based on the nice people who helped me, I can't because it was still a big issue for me.  I won't say that I won't use them again, but again I would rather not have to pay so much money that i had to scrounge for up front and then wait a month for it to be refunded.
 In the future, I will likely call my insurance ahead of time to confirm and then that way I can make a more informed choice on whether to receive services here or to go where it will be run through my insurance first. Again, I really appreciate the help of the billing manager and the marketing manager for making this situation a little less stressful.",1

13896,3,1547942400000,"Pros: BBQ is simple but flavorful
Cons: Sides could use a little work. Not much seating.
Overall: Go for the BBQ, you will not be disappointed.

First off, the BBQ is done very well.  They let the meat and the smoke do the talking.  The brisket is tender, rich, and has a light smoke to it.  The ribs are meaty with hint of smoke but a touch sweetness.  The hot links were ok, I expected more heat from it.

Second, the sides could be a bit better.  The macaroni and cheese could have more seasoning to it.  It wasn't overly cheesy or greasy but they could maybe add another type of cheese to round out the flavor.  The potato salad seemed a bit bland and some of the potatoes were a bit undercooked.  The cornbread muffin is small but it does have corn kernels which when bitten give a small sweetness to it.  They offer a side of homemade pickles which is great because it can help cut through the richness of some of the meat

Third, the staff is friendly and the place is small.  There's usually a line but the line goes quickly.  If you go during lunch, you may have to be lucky to find a seat or take your food to go.",2

13946,1,1548201600000,"Restaurant Muramoto is one of the dining establishments in Madison that was created with a successful vision, presentation and most importantly, the menu.  On this visit, I started with the miso.  A well balanced soup with a decent mix of scallions and tofu.  At $3, a nice diversion which unfortunately was marred by a merely warm rather than hot temperature.
Alongside the miso was a seaweed salad which may be the best salad in Madison.
Rounding out the savory portion of the meal was a roll comprised of yellowtail and scallion.  Though well crafted, nothing about it could be considered a greater result than a similar effort of the restaurant's closest competitors.  All the same, they were good enough to fit in contextually with the first two dishes consumed.  The standout of the meal was a dessert which may stand alone as one of the best I have experienced anywhere.  
A generous cake slice which included a chocolate granache frosting which sat atop a mixture of yellow cake and coconut, with a tangelo marmalade filling.  My dining companion was willing to share a little scoop of their ginger and honey infused ice cream.  A well aspected combination.",2
13946,2,1546819200000,"This was almost a 4. Came for my cousin's wedding last Saturday night. Private room, which was nice.

Had: some super expensive banquet meal.

Roasted piglet - juicy meat, crispy skin, but not the best I've ever had. I'd give it a 3.5/5.
Stir-fried snow peas, celery, scallop, conch - Conch was delicious. The rest of it was fairly standard.
Shark fin soup with crab meat - good amount of shark fin. Real crab meat. My gripe with this was that it had the strangest consistency. It was slimy (like snot). It did not drip. It was gooey. The broth was also quite bland.
Snow pea shoots with abalone and sea cucumber - abalone was tender. Snow pea shoots were fresh and delicious. They cooked the snow pea shoots in our room, so they were still super hot when they served them to us.
Crispy chicken - crispy skin, tender meat.
Lobster stir fried with maggi sauce - Typical.
I believe it was steamed bass, but I could have been mistaken - I'm not usually a big fan of steamed fish at restaurants (I prefer it at home), but this was delicious. 
E-fu noodles in broth with dumpling - I am not a fan of e-fu in broth. I like my e-fu braised or wok-fried. This was alright. Dumpling had a thin skin and a lot of shrimp and Chinese fungus in it. The filling was a tad chunky for me though.
Abalone fried rice - looks like yeung chow fried rice, but with what looks like bits of Chinese shiitake mushroom. Not mushroom. Abalone. Good amount of abalone. Tender abalone. Delicious fried rice.
Desserts - assorted cookies, peanut sweet soup with black bean glutinous rice dumplings. Peanut soup was not fragrant enough. It was also the same gooey, slimy texture as the shark fin soup. Cookies were not bad.

Service was quite good. I'm docking marks for the consistencies of both the shark fin soup and the dessert soup. Other than that, not bad.",2

13966,3,1548374400000,"We have been taking lessons for almost a year. I have 3 children ages 8 (Isabella), 6 (Peirce is autistic), and 5 (Campbell). Isabella is a wonderful smart girl, this past school year was a real struggle due to bullying. She has struggled with being able to push through a challenge and allow herself to fail, but to keep trying. Last fall we decided to put the kids in music lessons, drums. The second class for Isabella the teacher used a Metronome to help Isabella keep the beat. After about 30 seconds she told him I have to stop, I'm getting a tummy ache. Sam asked why she was struggling and she said I can't keep up, I'm afraid I won't be able to do it right so I think I need to stop. That wonderful man, Sam, sat there and talked to my daughter about how music is art and there is no imperfection in art. He explained to her that music lessons are just a means of teaching her how to use the instrument to create her own art. We transitioned and added another teacher so that all the kids could take lessons simultaneously, Peirce and Sam had a really good report so we let Isabella  switch to take lessons from Tony. Sam updated Tony regarding Isabella's struggles with perfectionism and the anxiety over making a mistake. Tony has been amazing taking over for her. He is pushing her to learn the fundamentals, but encouraging her to push outside of her self. She has actually started writing her own beats to take in to show him. Sam has been a dream with Peirce who's Autism can cause some challenges. Sam rolls with all of it and is truly loved and trusted by my son. After going to a Phillip Phillips concert  Peirce is a huge fan, Peirce told Sam He wanted to switch to a guitar. Sam didn't miss a beat, he took Peirce over to pick a guitar to borrow for the lesson and began teaching him to play that day. I love love love our music teachers at Guitar Center they are incredibly supportive and positive with my children. They support and encourage my children's love for music and most of all they nurture the kids' self-esteem to grow. I could not have taught her the wonderful lesson that Sam taught her to let go of the idea of perfection and just feel the beat. Tony with Isabella, Sam with Peirce, and now Ryan with Campbell are extremely important in the process of teaching our children to overcome hard things. About a month ago Isabella and Tony came out of the lesson early because she said her hand hurt too bad to play, she might have had a paper cut, Tony was encouraging her but she just wasn't budging. That was a week that he changed to a more challenging beat. She was intimidated and wanted to quit. I talked to her about the drummer for Def Leapord, yes she knows and likes their music, lost his arm. We talked about the fabulous thing about drumming is that you can use your feet. In no time Tony had her back on the drums using her feet, and she totally rocked!!! I thought I was sighning up for music lessons, but because of the incredible teachers at Guitar Center my kids are learning so much more, they are building confidence, learning that it's ok to have a plan change but also to not fear imperfection. I love that these teachers encourage their creativity rather than trying to force them to only play other people's music. They encourage my kids to be kids, none of the stern lectures or critiques that I remember from my childhood music teachers. Hands down some of the best $$$ we are spending. I don't care if my kids become fabulous musicians, I care that their confidence in all things grows from doing this one thing that they love.",2

There are wine barrels that line the bottom floor and the lighting is edgy and fun, yet makes the winery dark enough that you feel that warm ambiance that that the place emanates. The wine barrels are made into tables and you can find corks just about anywhere, even in the artwork on the walls, making the place scream winery like none other! There were also castle like chairs toward the back right corner of the bottom floor, which gave, yet another feeling of the eccentric atmosphere, leaving no detail out of their design layout! The wines were dry and I usually enjoy sweet wines, but they were nice to sample! My favorite was the ""Malbec"", which had a spicy zing to it, but was not overwhelming. I really thought that it was the perfect blend! The Merlot, Petite Sirah and Red Blend were pretty dry. I'm not a wine connoisseur but I really couldn't taste the difference between the three, though for being dry wines, they were very smooth. The sauvignon Blanc was good, though I couldn't taste the citrus undertones. The prices are $20-$39/bottle, though the bottle that is $39 is totally worth it- it is the Malbec.

Upon walking in, I lustily gazed at the beauty that is both machine and art.  Their Slayer Espresso Machine... Wow, such a gorgeous centre-piece other than their mural.  But I digress.

After wiping the drool off my chin from my lustful gaze, I order my standard drink, the Americano as the basis of comparison for all other indie coffee joints that I've held in held in high regard such as Mercury Espresso Bar, Lit , Te Aro, Manic and Dark Horse.

I'm a bit put off as their espresso shot was a bit ""too bright"".. perhaps it a little too soon for their espresso beans from Social Coffee Co to be used, but they're new so I'll cut them some slack.

The space is nice, but a little too small for my tastes.  I usually like to lazily sit around, reading a book or chatting up the baristas getting to know their philosophy about coffee and how they got into it.

The prices are really high, 300-900 dishes... So if you are willing to pay that kind of money you expect a good service, our waitress was really rude and a bit racist, she even asked us if we were ""even able to use chopsticks""(she said:are you even capable to use chopsticks?) which made me feel a little awkward. The waitress also forced us to order more dishes, and when we said no thanks she insisted. 
We couldn't enjoy our food because every time to time the waitress came to ask us if the food ""was excellent"" almost putting her fingers in the dishes (she did that at least 4 times). 
We also felt very awkward because she was all over us all the time(we couldn't talk because she stopped us to ask us if the food was good).
The quality of the food was not good, even in all you can eat places you can get  better rice and cabbage than here(seriously the quality was really bad).
And finally what I didn't like the most is the ""pricing tag"" that they put in our table, like saying ""these people got 1 2 and 3"" and marking them as completed as we get them, I just felt like in an eatery, for such prices I can't understand how disorganized and unprofessional the people were. 
Awful experience.
I forgot something else, how's it possible that with such prices they don't accept credit? All of the places I've been to (in which I've spent more than 100 per person) accepts credit, that's a must. 

I strongly recommend people to stay away of this place. This is far the worst food experience of my life.",2

I always end up ordering the 3 taco starter - I get chicken, potato and hibiscus. If you have never had the hibiscus taco you must get it now. So sweet and the most beautiful rose color. 
The last time I came here my boyfriend ordered the al pastor. It was on special and I believe it was one of the last nights they were serving it. Spicy pork and pineapple, we ended up ordering another serving it was that good!",2

The prices are a little high (it is good Asian food though), but the serving sizes are really big. Half of my friends couldn't finish their meals and brought the rest home.

14093,3,1548115200000,"After taking a ride on the High Roller we decided it was time to eat. Walking back toward the strip through the lovely promenade we stumbled upon Flour and Barley. We were immediately seated and even got a patio table so we could watch the light show. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us with decisions. I ordered the Flour and Barley flight of beer. This was great!!!! We ordered an order of garlic cheese bread and a pizza. We couldn't decide between the lasagna pizza or the farm house pizza so I told the waiter to choose one and not tell us until it arrived. This was actually a really fun way to get dinner for the night and the waiter even enjoyed it.

Our garlic bread came. It was great! It wasn't the normal hot dog bun bread you get from your local pizza eatery. It was smothered in cheese and had great flavors. 

When our pizza finally came, the anticipation had reached its peak. We received the farm house pizza! Great choice. The waiter said it was the chef's own creation so that's why he chose it. It was wonderful. We even took some home with us!!

Overall this was a great experience and not too overly priced for being on the strip. Recommendation would be two people per pizza. Try some drinks and share an appetizer. We walked out only paying around $50 and that was with a $10 tip.",1

Excellent fish and chips here, BUT I have noticed that over the years, the portions for fish and chips have gotten smaller.  It makes me want to come only on the days when they serve all you can eat fish and chips. I think, Fridays???

The roast chicken is another one of my favorites at Brocach. yum.

14103,3,1548374400000,"I've been here twice, and I like it. 

They don't take reservations unless you are a very large party, so if you don't want to wait go early.

If you are taking an older person they will be frustrated by the volume level. I didn't give a whoa, and kind of like that frantic-people talking-over-music thing, especially in Italian joints. BUT, guaranteed if you bring your mom or dad (or other person over 55) they will comment on the noise. 

You order the sides separately AND they have pasta starters. Double win.

The big meatball starter isn't the greatest, but it's worth it because it's fun to have around. I recommend the Osso Bucco, and their pastas WITHOUT Tomato Sauce. 

Enjoy the noisy nose!",3
14107,2,1547856000000,"Findlay Chevrolet sets itself apart from other dealerships, even within the same family. Last April, I had purchased a BMW Z4 from Findlay Honda in North Vegas. The salesman was forgettable, but the Finance Manager was fair. My options were not explained as well as I would have liked and I had to shell out extra money for a better warranty. 

Late last year, a friend of mine and I went to Findlay Hyundai so he could shop for a new Santa Fe Limited for his family. He has great credit, great job, etc., but the initial payment was over $900/month. After multiple negotiations, the price was down to $750, but still nowhere near he wanted to be. The sad part is, the Sales Manager decided to troll out and asked him bluntly ""You want us to work for free?"" Pathetic.
He bought a great late-model Toyota Highlander a couple of days later from CarMax.

In December, I was going through the process of a BK and called around to Findlay Toyota and Findlay Honda, who would not work with me until the BK was discharged and even then it was slim guarantee.
I had shopped much online and found a couple of great deals at Findlay Chevy and spoke with Chris Sebok. He was confident that as long as my BK meeting was set, I would be able to come in and pick something out. Outstanding.

Chris introduced me to one of his best salesman, Tony Lucero, a no-pressure salesman who was patient enough late one night to walk the lot and even to the used trade-ins. 
I was able to find a 2011 Ford Ranger with only 54k miles, great starter to rebuild my credit. As expected, the interest rate was a little high (my fault, not theirs) and they were real with me about time span if I wanted to refinance and other options.

After purchase and inspection, some body damage was discovered on the passenger side along the frame. Findlay went above and beyond by fixing the damage even after I had signed the paperwork. 

Overall, I have had this great truck for a few months now and should have taken the time sooner, but I am thankful there are salesman and financial reps out there who still put the customer first during difficult times.

Thanks again guys! I'll see you for my next purchase.",2

14113,1,1546819200000,"Hubby and I stopped in here for a ""snack"" and were surprised to see that it resembled more of a home-style Korean restaurant than an ""island"" (read: Hawaiian) joint.  It was late, maybe 1:30 and they weren't busy at all on a Saturday.  We were quickly seated and given menus along with iced barley tea and boiled peanuts.  We eagerly fell on the peanuts while perusing their menu.

So............I hate to do this to a joint that's so highly rated and with such friendly people but..............

My food came after an appropriate wait, not too long but not particularly quickly either, oxtail soup and spam musubi.  Hubby graciously persuaded me to start eating so I dug in while he snacked on the ban chan and peanuts and tasted my food.  No mac salad, no cold noodles.

After another while longer, we noted two, three other tables seated well after us getting all their food and chowing down together.  We gave it a few more minutes because maybe different kitchen zones were less busy than others.  Finally, we had to flag someone down.  The guy said he would go check on our order.

This part is what peeves me:  I know the temptation to cover up is great.  But I really don't like it when people don't come clean.  Apologize and tell me you forgot the order and I'll most likely forgive you because you were honest.   But don't tell me ""Your order will be out shortly, it just takes a little while.""  A few minutes later, I see through the window, the cook transferring dark noodles from point A to point B.  They plain forgot about the cold noodles AND the mac salad!  They didn't even acknowledge the mac salad after we got the cold noodles.  We gave them another few minutes and then just had them cancel it and they were like ""Ok.""

The food is good and the people are nice which is why I'm still giving them three stars.  But it wasn't busy and there was no reason that not even the mac salad was a no-show. No regrets but probably will try other places next time.",2
14117,3,1548374400000,"Casino is nice inside, especially for it's location.  I thought the slots were much tighter than average, but hey, someone has to pay for that decor inside (then again, I've done much better at the Cosmopolitan and the Eastside Cannery is nowhere near the level of the Cosmo).  The biggest disappointment was the bait and switch on tickets to a recent MMA event.  I wanted best available, and she circled on a map where they would be.  Looked good so I bought the tickets.  The seats and location noted on the tickets are not on the map of the arena.  When I brought it to the attention to the clerk who sold me the tickets, she kept looking on her screen telling me the section (yes, it says so on my tickets, my point is I don't know where in the arena these seats are as the floor plan doesn't show the section or seat on my ticket) she went back and talked to the manager (I think her name may have been Heidi) , came back and circled where I would be, which was different than where she initially said I'd be, worse seats (after I paid of course).  When I complained, she offered a refund but I already promised fight tickets to friends.  The night of the event, the seats are even worse than the other worse seats she told me they would be in.  2nd to the last row.  Another word of note, there were 2 additional people with us that were just going to buy tickets that night.  They were told there were only $100 seats left (ours were $33) so they opted to gamble and have dinner instead.  While we were inside, the entire last row behind us was empty (how are those seats $100 and ours were $33?), and not only that, but there were large patches of empty seats in the arena available that were better than ours (remember, I wanted best available and they gave me garbage seats).  So bottom line, they sell tickets to an event with a floor plan that is either outdated or for another arena altogether, and they tell you you're sitting in a certain area when in fact, you will be way in the back.  Bad way to do business, not cool at all.",2

Came in with my friend and his parents, we ordered a bottle of zin which was great and I ordered a turkey burger, my friend ordered a romaine wedge with grilled chicken, his parents ordered the lamb chops and Isabelle's chicken. 

My turkey burger with sweet potato fries was amazing, from what I noticed of my friend's parents they liked their meals. My friend had the romaine salad with chicken. The chicken was most likely pre-made, and it was super dry. My friend asked for another and they were pretty fast and got him a side of chicken and it was newly made and good.

We've been coming here for years now and have never had a bad experience; it may not be amazing or anything, but the consistently good food, reasonable prices, and fast service keep us coming back. Street parking is also super convenient and free after 9pm.

Their menu is extensive and we've liked everything we've tried so far. Their pho is great and on par with what you'd find at other Vietnamese restaurants in the city, but my personal favourite was always the curry chicken w/ rice vermicelli soup (217) - large, tender pieces of chicken in a deliciously flavourful curry noodle soup, yum! After I stopped eating chicken, I could still get my curry fix with the curry shrimp w/ bread (235) and they have quite a few vegetarian options as well, including the vegetarian spring rolls & vermicelli (908). Portions on all of their dishes are also very generous and give great bang for your buck. In terms of drinks, I would definitely recommend the tea w/ condensed milk (001) - but get it hot because ice dilutes the drink a lot. 

Overall, a solid choice for Vietnamese food in the Chinatown area, especially if you're looking for some late night eats!",2

We started with some Kaya chips and Yucatan Hot Bean Dip, then some fried chicken tacos. The chips were a treat and the bean dip was almost like chili, which I enjoyed. It had a spicy kick, but I didn't think it was that hot. The fried chicken tacos were absolutely delicious.

I ordered the Kaya Burger for my meal and was pleasantly surprised with it. The egg made for a great burger and the Kaya sauce was extremely tasty. I expected the avacado and bacon to stand out, but there was a blend of flavors instead, which was great. I was surprised by how small the burger looked when I got it, the the burger patty was very thick and I was stuffed when I finished. I was also able to try some jerked chicken from a colleague's plate and it was exquisite. Not only was the flavor out of this world, it was very juicy.",1

Pros:
Loads of fun. You get to shoot Zombies. You get your cardio up. If you're like me, you'll be scared. The communication was great. I needed to change my feature time the same day, I texted the number that is in the reservation and got a text back in like 5 minutes. They changed my time with no problems. An all in all great time.

Cons:
Shorter than expected. It is really far out. Our taxi cab ride from Planet Hollywood (Center Strip) was $50.90 each way. Wow. I wasn't expecting that at all. I did hear from the people there that there was an option to pay for their shuttle that leaves from their store at Circus Circus. However, I didn't see that option when booking online. Plus, Circus Circus is so far out of the way, I wouldn't have wanted to do that either. So just keep in mind the distance.

Fries were overcooked. The onion rings did have a different batter, a bit sweet, and got their only taste from the salt sprinkled on them. The fish was just a square, like you'd get from your grocer's freezer, so I''m not sure what we're paying for. Even their sauce was like a sweeter ketchup. The rice krispy treat was a great consistency but tasted like coconut.  Overall, a huge waste of $20.",2

14266,2,1547510400000,"I don't ever really venture into the Southside because it's not really my cup of tea. Lots of cool shops and things to do but getting there parking or even public transportation is too annoying. It has to be something special for me to head to the Southside.

My partner and I we're going to go to dinner before we headed to a show and we were trying to decide where to go. Do we do something fun and classy and spend maybe a little bit more money than we wanted to? Or do we go and get wings. Of course we decided to go get wings

I'm not saying that we're not classy and we don't like to spend a little bit of money on good food but considering that my graduation was last week saving money on food really was something I need to do. Archie's has delicious food. This was maybe the second time that I've been here and I was really impressed with the size of their wings and with the flavor choices. They had celery and carrots with ranch and blue cheese which is a usual for wings but I found some places that don't offer this on the side.

When looking over the wing choices we decided to order 20 wings, so two orders of 10. Because we got two orders of 10 we were able to get two choices of sauces. If you wanted to split up the orders into more sauces you had to pay extra. We went with a dry Cajun and the honey mustard. Both were delicious. Next time that I would be there I would ask them to throw a little bit more seasoning on the dry Cajun but other than that it was great. The honey mustard was also dripping with sauce just the way I like it. And the cool crunch of those celery and carrot sticks really went above and beyond.

I also ordered a side salad which was huge and only ate about half of it. Sometimes when you're doing fried food for dinner you might want to add a little more vegetables. I probably could have passed. But I will say I did eat that salad the next day.

The staff was really fun and attentive. They made me laugh a lot. I would definitely come back here for wings. I hear that they do have some specials and maybe I'll come back on a day where I can partake in those. Really nice spot with ample seating and my favorite part was you could actually hear the person across the table from you.",3

   Up here in vegas for vacation and was craving some authentic asian food since me and my bf have been eating soooo much american or fast food. Really wanted yakiniku, searched for places in this area and based on the pictures we came here :) Everything was yum, the dinner special comes with brisket and pork belly for the first course, I LOVE pork belly so yessss, of course it takes forever to cook through so the wait was agonizing but the brisket was there hehe. There was kimchee cabbage and bean sprouts put right on the grill which was cool, korean side dishes are delicious. 
   The servers even come and check on your food and flip it if its ready and cut it up with the meat shears, so helpful. The next course we had were short ribs (YES), it was three slabs of the short ribs which was a lot so we knew the next time to get half portions of the meats. Then we got half spicy pork belly (yes), half spicy chicken (okay), half short ribs again (obvi yes).
   Oh we also each got a bowl of white rice which is included with the special, the sauces and sides and meat were great and we were so stuffed and satisfied by the end of the meal.
Definitely recommend as a great yakiniku spot in the area! Would so come back if we weren't trying to go to different places, but maybe next time :)))",2
14309,2,1547856000000,"The last two times I have been there the service was awful, the appetizers were served still frozen and one person didn't get their meal till 30 minutes after the table had been served... Not worth it",1
14316,2,1548201600000,"Decor 4.0/5 - It feels very homely here...like you're eating out of their dining room.  It's cozy with a nice romantic ambiance.  Definitely somewhere you can escape to if you want to avoid the larger big box noise restaurants and have your own little private booth.  Nothing jazzy but nothing to complain about either.

Service 4.0/5 - The staff is very friendly here all the way down from the chef to the hostess to the servers.  Food is promptly brought to you and from the times I've been there, the staff is always checking up to make sure your tea is filled; the hostess comes by to check on you; even the sushi chef/owner comes by to say hi (obviously, when it's not too busy).  Great family run business and their passion shows.   

Food 4.5/5 - As this place appears to be owned by Koreans, you'll get your sushi food infused with Korean cultural cuisine as well.  Before your food arrives, you'll get a nice assortment of Korean appetizers - kim chi, bean sprouts, tofu.  The kim chi is a winner here, perfect balance of salt, sour, and chillies.  

However, probably the BEST REASON to come here is for their grilled mackerel.  You must ask for this if they don't bring it to you.  IT'S A MUST.  What first appears to be just another piece of grilled fish with a lemon garnish on top, the moment you dive in you'll realize this is way more than that.  The fish is perfectly seasoned with a crispy grilled exterior and the inside is heavenly tender and juicy all around.  And this is an appetizer - ON THE HOUSE!  I would definitely pay for this if it was on the menu (shhh....don't tell them or they might just start doing this) and it's probably why I come here instead of other sushi places.

The sushi/sashimi is great too.  The rice is fresh and moist with the correct flavouring combination of sugar and wine.  You get a healthy portion of fish no matter what you're ordering and the fish/rice ration is perfect for sushi.  

I LOVE THIS PLACE and will always come back, especially knowing it's to support a small family-run business.   Take your significant other here; you won't be disappointed.",2

14320,1,1548374400000,"In a previous life, I spent a lot of time at the W Hotel in Seattle.  Far from just a hotel, back in those days at the beginning of the 21st century, the W provided Seatellites with a chic, beautiful, modern and really swanky place to chill after work. Toronto has some great places to hang out, but it's always lacked a place with that 'W' kind of feel.  Yeah I know, some of you will think of the Drake.  But it's just not the same.  As far as I know, Spice Safar is the closest we've come, and it's not a hotel, it's a coffee lounge.

But even better than the 'W' like ambiance, is the service.  During the many hours that I've spent at Spice Safar over the last couple of weeks, I've often been served by Jane or Anna.  Coincidentally, they happen to both hail from Australia.  Makes me want to visit the land down under more than ever.  They are the consummate hosts, and are capable of making every drink an experience, even if it's just green tea.   The coffee is awesome, I usually get an Americano, and these always come with a little nibble of pastry, which always happen to leave you wanting just a bit more!  But wait, there's more...

This place has far more than coffee, and great pastries; it's also a licensed bar.  Jane tells me they're about to start hosting weekly mixers for local businesses, and one can often find Anna the barrista/mixologist tinkering with cocktails behind the bar.  I'm not a big martini/cocktail drinker myself, but if that's your thing, my bet is you'll find what you're looking for here.  

Now here's a tip.  In an unusually creative twist, Spice Safar also offers a coffee card.  What's unique about this loyalty card though is that it starts with a free coffee.  Make sure you ask for it.   Tell them you're a friend of Ray's and they may even give you a slightly bigger nibble of pastry!  

I suggest you try this place..  You'll find yourself spending more time there than you'd planned, trust me.",2

The food was great! We had a combination veggie/meat dish that was probably enough food to feed 6 people. Not only was there a lot of food, it was good quality food. The vegetables were fresh and the meats were tender. Everything was well seasoned and there was a wide variety of textures and so many different flavors to try. The colors were beautiful and everything was arrayed so nicely it felt like a feast.

The service was excellent and very personable. Our server was the same person who cooked the food and she answered all of our questions and was very patient with our ""newness"" to the cuisine.

The most amazing part is that it cost us only $25 to feed 4 people with a ton of leftovers. I couldn't believe the price for the quality of the food and excellent service.

The food: I think the sushi is as good as any I've had in Calgary. Nothing compared of Vancouver, but still very good. The selection on the menu pretty good and we usually order from the sushi menu plus one or two of the special rolls. Whatever I've ordered off the menu has been delicious and presented beautifully. One criticism I would have is that the menu hasn't changed a lot over the past few years, but that could be taken as a good thing too, depending on what you like. 

The atmosphere: what I love about this place is the restaurant itself! There is a sushi bar with floating boats, a little pond with fish, and a display case full of Japanese sushi and tea dishware. The decoration is splendid. 

Overall: one other thing is that no matter when I have come, I've never had to wait for a table. The place isn't huge, but there is no waiting for great sushi! If you haven't tried this place, I would highly recommend it. It has become a standard for our date nights.",2

14430,2,1547596800000,"As I am a Pitt alum, your skepticism, dear reader, of this review is natural. But still, lend me your ears (err, eyes). Yes, the O is an infamous Oakland institution, your first accidental order of large fries is a rite of passage when you're a Pitt student, the regular employees look like they came out of a slasher flick, the setup is questionable, and the place is dingy as all hell.

Now, all that out of the way, how's the food? Well, it varies. In general, anything they do in-house or get private label is quite good. To elaborate, their fries are cut fresh, their hot dogs are made exclusively for them, and the hoagies are made to order without frozen ingredients. These are all wonderful. The fries shouldn't be even called fries in a strict sense; they're prepared in the same manner as French or Belgian frites. Due to double frying, the outsides are potato chip crispy, the insides are sublimely creamy, and they're deftly salted. The fact that they're served in absurd portions adds to the experience, as do the lowbrow but delicious options of processed cheese or beef gravy as dips. The hot dogs are natural casing and thus have an unparalleled snap. They lack the mushiness commonly found with lower quality dogs and so eat more like a piece of meat, with excellent spicing to boot. Factor in free chili (among other toppings) and a piece of freshly steamed cheese for $0.50 and you have drunk food bliss or sober great eats. Although I've never tried the subs, I've heard nothing but great things.

The rest of the menu is, unfortunately, mostly pre-frozen including the 21 shrimp (which I admit to gorging on while inebriated), chicken parm sandwich, and fish dinners. Not worth the dough you have to shell out. Why you would order pizza here with $5 Sorrento's or $8 Romano within walking distance is beyond me. The beer selection is puzzlingly excellent.",2

14454,2,1548720000000,"I came in with long black hair. My ends were split to hell, and I still had black on the bottom portion on my hair....and I wanted to go blonde. I knew this was a hard task for anyone to take on, especially as annoying as my hair can get. I searched for someone who could get the job done. Enter Lionel. First off, he calls back on his personal cellphone. I don't know how many beauticians add that personal touch, especially from a client they've never had. 

Off the bat he knew exactly what I wanted, which I was amazed by because I can't describe what I want to save my life. We started on a 2-day process to get my hair to where I wanted it. As someone who has had dark hair all her life, this dramatic change was handled amazingly! His expectations were given very honestly. He doesn't sugarcoat anything and will tell you exactly what you're in for. Aside from that, he is hilarious and so easy to get along with. You can truly feel how much he loves his craft. 

My hair came out amazing! I'm so happy with my results. I am getting tons of compliments (which I'm not ever used to getting) on how good it looks. I have finally found my hair guru!",2

We still ate them anyways. Service is normally decent. Waitresses have always been friendly. Service time is lacking a little bit.

He did not make me feel like he was rushing even though they were almost closing. You can tell he takes pride in his art. He ensured I was happy with the outcome. 
After a long day at work, he definitely put a smile on my face because I was very satified with the way my nails turned out. He is very talented. Love his work! It was my first time at Nail Club and I will for sure be going back to see them.",3

The interior of the restaurant is spacious and very relaxing after shopping for a few hours.  The sushi and hot entrees are pretty good and the service is fast and friendly.

Sometimes you just want to get your grub on and this place is more than adequate to satisfy your needs.  Don't come expecting top notch sushi here and you'll have a fine dining experience.",2

DELICIOUS, the fish and chicken were both seasoned very well, not too salty but just right. Also the sides I ordered, broccoli casserole and mac n cheese were delectable.

14476,2,1547683200000,"Oh my yum. 

I'm from California. Being from California I am, of course, very familiar with French Laundry and the bar that it has set. I could never (in the foreseeable future) be comfortable spending $270 per person for a tasting menu, so French Laundry is not in the cards. Still, I thought trying a Thomas Keller restaurant could be great and assumed that Bouchon would also be out of my price range. After looking at the menu, I was pleasantly surprised! Bouchon is probably one of the more AFFORDABLE restaurants on the Strip in terms of fine dining. The food and the service were not lacking, either. This place knows how to do it right.

The ambiance was perfect; exactly what we were hoping for. It's fairly big, but each table still seems intimate enough. The dark wood gives it a great old school feel very reminiscent of wine country. The bar is a fantastic place to wait for your table: craft cocktails are shaken up and served by friendly bartenders.

After being seated, my fiancé and I started with the beignets (cod) and a seared octopus special. The beignets were a touch salty for me, but both dishes were great. I opted for the trout (yum!) for me entree and he went with the chicken. Both so simple, but done so well! After eating our way through two courses, we couldn't pass up dessert. We had seen an order of the profiteroles come out and we knew we couldn't pass them up so we split a deliciously decadent order (one order for two people is sufficient). While the food was being coursed out ever-so-perfectly, our waitress was super attentive without hounding us. We've eaten at a fair share of nice restaurants, but we both left commenting on how great the service was. Absolutely stellar.

 When all was said and done, we both left with great tastes in our mouth (figuratively and literally). I would recommend Bouchon to anyone looking for a great dining experience in Vegas. In a city that has no shortage of fine dining options, it's hard to make the final decision on dinner reservations (I went through a few options before settling on this and STRIPSTEAK), but this needs to be on the top of the list. The bill wasn't cheap, of course, but it didn't feel overpriced; it seemed well-priced for the environment, the service, and the quality of food.",2
14484,3,1547596800000,"I tried Grimaldi's for the first time at least a year ago. I don't even remember if I like the pizza here, so it was a good time to come back and try it again.

Service: 2 Stars.
Ugh....Where do I begin? If you get a server named Jilani, beware!! You may want to ask for someone else. I usually don't name employees who gave bad service in my reviews, but this guy made me angry! We came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was perfect timing because we had just missed the lunch rush and it wasn't as crowded. After the hostess showed us to our table, we waited for 15 minutes until our server finally showed up. What annoyed me was that there was another couple that was sitting right next to us and arrived after we did. Yet, they got serviced by Jilani first. A few minutes later, I overheard the hostess telling him that we came in first and have been waiting for a while. Thank you for actually noticing. He obviously sucks at keeping track of his tables. Finally, he stops by our table. No ""Hello"" or ""Welcome,"" just ""What would you like to order?"" We pretty much didn't see him until paying for our bill. Other servers, who were much more friendly, brought us our drinks and food. 2 starts for them! Jilani did not care to check on us while we were eating, nor did he offer to refill our drinks. After we were done, we waited for another 15 minutes until he finally showed up again and asked ""You want me to box that?"" No, I'm going to spend the rest of the day here staring at my 3 slices of leftover pizza. What do you think?! A few minutes later, he dropped off the pizza and bill without saying a word. I don't even know why I left him a tip. Although it was much less that what I would have left for a good server. 

Food: 4 Stars.
Not the best tasting pizza I have eaten, but still pretty good. I don't know if I came here on a off day, but my pepperoni pizza was a bit salty. I do like their crispy thin crust and fresh ingredients. Although once in a while, the cheese would completely fall off the slice.

If you sign up for their VIP newsletter through their website, you will get a coupon for $5 off your next bill. They also give you a free pizza on your birthday.

Hoping for better service the next time around!",2

Yes! serves no purpose to me.  It goes straight to the trash and just adds to the landfill -- not even considering the trees that are wasted in making it. If no one happens to put it in the trash while I'm gone, it just serves to let the ""bad guys"" that no one is home.

We ultimately chose EPIC Landscape and are very happy that we did. Dan, the owner, was very prompt in providing an initial estimate and he was very patient in helping us, complete novices in desert life, translate what we wanted into a viable landscaping plan.

I definitely didn't need all that food but I had to try it all. The blueberry fritter was awesome. Nami definitely does a great job with their vegan baked goods. The vegan huevos rancheros was an interesting take on the classic dish. It had hash browns, chili-spiced black beans, tofu, and some kind of mystery bean or protein that I couldn't figure out what it was.

Nevertheless it was all pretty good. Not to mention, the place was packed, which is always a good sign. However, don't go there on a weekend expecting to get a seat. Very limited seating and for all the people there, it was a slim chance. Especially with loners like me taking up a whole table.",3
14611,1,1548028800000,"When I first walked in, I was a little intimidated. That was gone by my second visit as the crew at Chavez Boxing are very warm and welcoming to all. Coach Pete is an accomplished boxer who gives so much of his time to the community. It's evident that he uses the gym mainly as a way to improve the lives of youths in the neighborhood. You won't find many people that put more effort and time (he is ALWAYS there) into their business. Fortunately for me, Chavez Boxing Gym is also home to some excellent instructors. I've been working with Coach Adam for about 15 months and my confidence has soared in that time. I've also dropped a considerable amount of weight. You not only get a great workout but also a strong understanding of the art of boxing (there is A LOT more to it than just throwing punches). Adam is incredibly patient and never overwhelms me with information but once I get a certain technique down, we move on to the next area to improve. I go twice a week and it's become something I really look forward to as a workout, a stress reliever and also time with a really great group of people who are passionate about helping others.

A bottle of Hana Sake is only $20, that's a plus.  The service is is very good.  The reason I gave it a 4 star is their menu for AYCE is not extensive like the other sushi place near me.

I booked my hot stone massage a few weeks ago and wrote the time down in my agenda. I then received a rude phone call from an administrative assistant stating that my appointment was for 12pm and that due to me missing it I would have to pay a fee. I explained to her very nicely that I remember writing down my appointment for 5pm not 12pm. She told me that it was at 12pm and that someone had even called and left a reminder about what time my appointment was. Again I stressed to her that my appointment was not for 12pm it was for 5pm that she was telling me it was and that I did not receive a reminder through voice mail. I received someone hanging up and not leaving a message at all. I then told her that I wanted to speak to the manager. When the manger called me back, she did not take my feelings into consideration and seemed to not even hear what I was saying. As a result I ended up paying for the fee which I now feel I should not have done! They were very unsympathetic and extremely unprofessional.  I also informed the manager that I will no longer will be coming to this clinic. Very poor customer service to say the least!",2

After a movie at Village Square I recommended Khoury's to friends...MY BAD. First of all, the server was overwhelmed and, of course, the service was very slow and inept.....not the server's fault. She was working very hard given her circumstances.
Despite the slow service, we had a great time(I'll get to the food later). We watched this scruffy middle aged man, in shorts and Tee shirt, smooch some famliar tables. We hilariously determined that he was the owner/manager....great entertainment!!!!
So...the food...
I would have not taken the time to write this review if I wasn't embarrassed by my recommendation and if our Lamb Shawarma tasted as I experienced on our previous visits.

When he took them to the register it turned out that they were marked down another 50%. The cashier pointed out that he saved more than he spent. I started postulating that if we kept shopping we could actually eventually make money...I think she believed me. 

Going with my theory we shopped on. I found the most amazing and sexy pair of shoes by famous American designer and Project Runway judge Michael Kors. They have high heels, laces and lucite...sssssexy! Of course, they were on sale. I was trying to rationalize spending that much money (even on sale they were pricey) on shoes...took about 2 minutes.

I was informed that John is the best and will do a great job, and that he did. He knew about muscle pains and when he worked on my calf he did warn me that it was going to hurt and yes it did!! He said will be sore and stay off it for a few days and it should be back to normal.... Will definitely be going back and highly recommended.

To start the evening we had Ethiopian Amber Beer and Koranti (hot tea with Greek liquor ouzo) the tea has a strong aroma of cinnamon,its not for the fainthearted.
The drinks were followed by
 Doro Wat (Spicy Chicken stew with red pepper,onions and spices) served with hard boiled eggs.
Yebeg Alicha Sega wat (Mild Lamb Stew with onions,turmeric,herbs)
Misir Wat (red lentils cooked with onions,red peppers,herbs).Its medium spicy.
Most of the dishes are cooked in Kibae(butter with spices).
we enjoyed all these delicacies with a side of Ethiopian bread Injera,which is a crepe made from wheat flour.Also don't miss the Ethiopian Coffee.

What comes as a pleasant surprise is that Ethiopian food is like a distant cousin of Indian food with its extensive use of spices and butter,turmeric,onions.The Crepe also reminds me of something between a dosa and uttapam.
They also have a lot of options for Vegetarians.So go check it out.

It is really fun to go during the weekend at night time, since they offer a full bar with gambling, a bunch of TV's and games you can play. 

The sushi bar is separate from the bar, and they even offer couches you can sit on if you prefer to eat your sushi in a more comfortable setting. 

Me and my girlfriend usually go here about once a week. 

They also offer all you can eat Sushi as well! 

Their crouching tiger roll and Lisa Lisa roll is amazing :) 

The only complain I could make is they have one Sushi Chef who is a women ( no offense ) but every time she is there I will leave- because every time she makes my sushi it always falls apart, and I hate when sushi falls apart. 

I prefer the other sushi chefs who I am never disappointed with. 

Other than that, it is a really hip and modern place with great Sushi at a great price :)

But the food was worth the wait. I had the lobster and shrimp eggs benedict and my friend and I split a short stack of the Apples and Cream pancakes. The eggs benedict was amazing - the texture and flavors worked so well together. Also, dipping the amazing bread into the sauce and egg yolks is DEFINITELY the move. Pancakes were out of this world too. Only thing is that the place is really hectic - not very organized, which probably contributes to the long lines. Also, it's cash only (no fear, there's an ATM right next door). Finally, it's like super greasy in there. Like they need better air ventilation or something.

14771,2,1548720000000,"Aladdin's is one of my favorite restaurants and a great fallback when there's no where else I want to go. Don't let the Lebanese/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean label scare you- Aladdin's has something for everyone.
First off, everything at Aladdin's is fresh and delicious. I've never had anything there that wasn't made well or seemed to come from a box. The lettuce is always crispy, the meats fresh and juicy, and I love their pita. Plus, with so many vegetarian dishes on the menu, I doubt there will be too many people that can find a fault with Aladdin's.
My favorite thing to get on the menu is the Flavor Savor Plate. It has a bunch of the best from Aladdin's, with Chicken Mishwi, Beef Kafta, rice, salad, hummos, and Falaffel (mmm... Falaffel). They also have a dozen other plates with all kinds of chicken, lamb, beef, and other combinations that will make your head spin, but if you have no idea what to order, get the Flavor Savor and you'll get a little bit of the best on the menu- plus at $9.95, you can't beat the price and will probably have leftovers.
Aladdin's also has these amazing stuffed pitas. They take fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, and overstuff them into a pita pocket. Then, they put a meat on it, a choice of feta or cheddar cheese, and dressing. These things are huge, and my favorite is the tuna pocket. The tuna is big chunks of tuna steak that is cubed and grilled with seasonings- yum.
I've also tried several of their pita pizzas, which have a crispy pita base and lots of choices on toppings. There also wraps, rolls, cheese pies, stuffed grape leaves, and lots more- the menu will make your head spin. For an appetizer, you can't go wrong with their hummos.
Finally, make sure you leave room for dessert. Despite their Middle Eastern menu, they have very Americanized desserts that are freaking awesome. You can't miss them when you walk in- they're in a case at the front entrance. These monster cakes are incredible, and could have anything from double chocolate cake, to red velvet cake, carrot cake, or lots of others. The cakes are huge, and the portions are giant. Many times, I come here just for dessert. They also usually have two or three different kinds of baklava, which are moist and sweet and better then my grandmother's (sorry Nene).
Are you still reading?? Why haven't you headed over to Aladdin's yet? Don't worry, the place is casual, so you don't even have to dress up, and you'll want to bring a friend because the portions are big and you'll want to share. Enjoy!",2

14805,2,1548028800000,"This is pretty much the best and most consistent bubble you'll find in Pittsburgh. However, my 4 star rating goes to a couple particular teas and also to the boba itself. I have really high standards for bubble tea wherever I go (I'm Taiwanese, go figure) but even so I let a few of them pass when I came to Fuku. 

They push their tea selection, and although I usually go for that elsewhere, here I just ignore it completely. Not because it is bad, but I found some of their other drinks just far better.

Firstly, I LOVE their: Chai Iced Tea, Thai Iced Tea, Taro Iced Tea, and (sometimes) their Matcha Iced Tea. That's pretty much it. Those teas go GREAT with the warm honey bubbles (Oh, that's a whole 2 stars by itself. I LOVE warm + honey bubbles so I'm in heaven every time). I do recommend going down a notch on the sugar if you have the option (like with the Matcha) because it's super sweet, creamy, and heavy. So if you like that stick to the regular. 

Their service is great, never had a problem. One time we came late and the lady moving the sign in felt bad for us and ushered us in anyway. Sadly the bubbles were already thrown out so we left anyway, but I'm grateful for that one time! One of the server girls even recognized me later because of it. So overall, nice service, nice people, they usually look like they enjoy each other's company while working. Also, it's fast and fresh every time so I love that.

The changing and seasonal items are a plus, I like the experimenting!

I would say one downside was their plain Honey Oolong milk tea with bubbles, which my friend ordered one time. I hope it was an off day, because with the low sugar content (it was ordered that way) the pairing between the tea and bubbles and milk was just... bleh. Not great. And I can personally attest to this combo because my friend and I run our own bubble tea pop up, and we have made this particular drink; and the flavors can work better than that. So, if you're  a bubble tea snob like us and are trying to excruciatingly analyze the flavor pairings here, just don't bother. Grab yourself a signature drink and just enjoy it :) 

All in all I love Fuku and come back here on the regular! (But why does it take 12, yes 12 bubble teas to get a free one?? A little excessive ): )",2

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because our waitress took forever to come check on us at each period of the meal. To get our check I had to go hunt her down and literally found her in the back of the bar on her phone texting. It was very frustrating. 

Try this place if you haven't. For the food, not the service. LOL",2
14811,2,1547337600000,"Finally, an authentic Thai resto in Montreal!
Instead of the usual dumbing down of Thai food with loads of sugar and not enough unique flavours, Pamika delivers the real deal. Anyone can do good Pad Thai, basically the Thai equivalent of hotdogs in North America; big deal. Who cares about backpacker $1/day food? Pamika comes through with the subtleties and complexities of real Thai cooking, with none of the compromises of most local places. 

The yum wun sen (glass noodle-seafood salad) is beautifully executed, with a perfect balance of flavours and textures. Apart from homemade, this is easily the best I've had outside of Thailand. Their Issan som tam (green papaya salad from Issan province) is something nobody else does in Montreal, an Eastern Thai take on the standard. Some might find it a little too fishy with the prominent ""funk"" of rarely used Thai fish paste, but they also offer a regular som tam on the menu. The duck salad was a wonderful surprise, scooped up in napa leaves. And their sticky rice was cooked to perfection, as opposed to a gummy, globular mass.

Also, cocktails. Wow!

14831,1,1548288000000,"This place didn't make me feel ancient so it gets 3 stars just for that. Drinks at the upstairs bar were reasonably priced, though I hopped between the smoking cage, the upstairs dancefloor and the street-level bar that you see upon entry. This is a great ""club"" that you can bring your non-dancing menfolk to as well, because they can sit and watch street traffic whilst admiring the taxidermed (?)  wildlife. 

I really, really, really enjoyed that they did have a cage for smoking, because I don't like milling about the entrance and having to get stamped, etc. There was a bouncer out there which was cool, I suppose mainly so that no one could hop on through the chain link fence to sneak in through the back.

I really liked the DJ's (went on a Saturday night) especially any oldschool hip hop RnB mix. Later in the night there was standard remixed top 40 club, which was just fine with me, and actually prefer a nice build of RnB to start and then heavier club to keep it going. When the dancefloor got too sweaty I was able to chill out downstairs (to watch the really ""inspired"" trance dancing) or hit the bathrooms. Lots of stalls, a nice seating area, lots of mirrors for touch-ups, but tapwater was SCALDING.

Again, the best thing about Commonwealth is that you can travel around, you are not confined to one type of music or one type of room. Love the smoke pit and the chilled out man-pub in the front, and the good mix of ages and music.

Every other plate we ordered was really good and we ordered a lot.  You can order from a variety of slider tapas, skewer tapas and some other types of tapas.

The outdoor area is so nice and for the most part the bartender's are nice... Not a huge fan of the outdoor bar's usual female bartender though. However the upstairs area is a hidden gem, they usually have electronic music you can dance to and it's a cool scene. They have live music sometimes which us fun. 

The best thing about this bar is that it doesn't feel like the rest of the bars are clubs around it, you can hear people when you want to talk and there is always a place to sit and chill with your friends but you can also get up and dance if you want to as well. The best of both worlds. Unfortunately I moved back to Denver so it won't be my regular hang out spot anymore but I felt I needed to write them a review because I've had so many great memories made there.",1

They each looked great.  I went with the meat lovers pizza, see the picture.  The pizzas appear to be from a fire oven. I feel that adds a little extra taste, as long as it is not burned.  Also, they were not just out of the oven, so they had time to set. This was truly a great pizza. 9.5/10

They have fish tanks of live seafood you can order which is pretty neat.  The menu is pretty giant and they have a good sized selection of vegetarian food.  The vegetable with black mushroom dish I had was very good it just took a really long time to come out.  My buddies's peking duck came out about 10 minutes before mine.  I'm not really sure what happened. Our waitress was very nice and helpfull with the menu and our questions about the food before we ordered.

I went here once out of curiosity, and then the other 4 or 5 (yes really, that many) times I have been because that's where everyone else already was and we got invited.  Let me remind you, I hate Jimmy Buffett music.  It's so annoying!

Aside from the fact that I am inundated with music that I can't stand, and usually it's the same three songs over and over, the food here is not bad.  I usually get the coconut shrimp because they are always crispy and they actually taste like there is some coconut on them, unlike most places that like to overcharge you for ""coconut"" shrimp.  It also comes with a really yummy marmalade dipping sauce.  I actually love their peel and eat shrimp though.  I think they are boiled in beer or something, and they come in a big giant clam dish filled with ice.  Kind of weird, but it makes me laugh.  The shrimp themselves are really yummy, tasting exactly like peel and eat shrimp should.  The cocktail sauce they serve with it is a really nice pairing to the shrimp.  It's moderately spicy so it doesn't kill my tastebuds before I am finished eating.

The service here is usually lacking.  Well, I take that back, it's always lacking.  You have to track someone down to get refills.  Aside from that, I have never found any of my servers to be particularly personable there.  Maybe it's because they hate Jimmy Buffett music too and they are miserable because they work there.  Or maybe they are just sick of dodging that stupid person on stilts who makes balloon thingies.  I hate that person.

Considering there isn't a whole lot to do in Westgate, Margaritaville isn't a bad option.  It gets crowded really easily though, so put your name in early or come on a non weekend night.  This place is just okay, but the tourist factor appeals to a lot of people.",2

The restaurant also served food but the majority of customers including myself seemed to be enjoying ice cream and judging by the empty dishes including my own we all seemed to be thoroughly enjoying ourselves. The restaurant was clean and pink. The motif of the restaurant is pink and white or maybe it was originally red and white and with time it faded to pepto bismol pink.

15053,1,1547769600000,"I went to this AE Outfitters yesterday looking for an off the shoulder top.The context is Friday night around 8pm, so the store was not busy. I looked around for a bit, then asked one of the salespeople for more options. He was quite helpful, and showed me a couple of styles and led me to the dressing room. I had about 4 tops with me. 

I tried them on, and found one I liked that was a bit too big, so I pressed the button in the dressing room to get assistance. I waited for a bit. No one answered. So I walked out and saw a staff person sitting on one of the high chairs in front playing a game on her cell phone. Professional? I called her a few times. She ignored me. Then maybe on the 4th or 5th call, she turned around and said she was on break. She quickly gestured to someone on the floor who was helping another customer. The other salesperson saw me said she would help me in a bit. 

So I went back inside the dressing room and waited, and was just about to leave when the salesperson came and asked me what she could get. I told her a smaller size, but she came back empty handed. Fair enough. So I decided to take the top anyway and made my way to the cashier. NO ONE WAS THERE. I waited for a bit but then got fed up, and threw the top on the counter and left. No one knew or cared. Basically, I was like ""Shut up and take my money!"" and this poor quality store could not be bothered.

The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is for the first salesperson who helped and checked up on me. But with three people surrounding me and only one person who actually did something, they couldn't even make a sale. AE needs to be better with managing salespeople and their etiquette. 

Full disclosure, I am annoyed right now, so my words will be a bit more biting. But here it goes: I get that the store is in a hipster neighbourhood/fashion district. But let's be honest here, AE is neither high end or great quality. I expect at least a modicum of respect in any store, and at the very least for someone to be at the cash counter. I wonder if they're hemorrhaging money with so many salespeople. Plus, isn't it the point of hipster neighbourhoods to give the customer more of a personalized experience. I did not get that here.",2

$8/burger.  We ordered #1 (a regular burger) and #2 (burger with egg and lots of weird sauce).  I was hoping my egg would be runny, but it was overcooked, tiny, and really salty.  $3-$4 for the fries. Ordered both the garlic fries and the gravy fries.  MEH. I prefer IN N OUT over this garbage.  I think they thought I was a local or an employee because I got a pretty damn good discount on top of my order... whateverz...it was still nasty. lol

the only fun thing about this place is that you can get creative with your name by giving them a nickname.  so when your food is ready, they will call your ""name"".  my gf and i thought it'd be funny to be called ""hot mama"", so when our food was ready, they announced ""hot mama, your order is ready"" lol

Second incident was today 12/29/2017, was looking for an elbow sleeve, and the box was torn, I asked the employee if there was an unopened product so I can purchase the product, and the older gentleman retorted we can always give you a new box and was quite rude.

15100,2,1548201600000,"Let me first start off by saying this is the first time I've ever seen a supermarket pull a ""where east meets west"" type of thing (I'm used to T&T supermarket/ Canadian Superstore/ Loblaws... etc). The very least I expected to see Chinese-English bilingual signage, but nope, nada. In that respect I found it was trying to hide the asianness of the supermarket... I guess you can say I'm biased, why should it be Chinese and not Vietnamese or some other asian language? I don't mind, as long as there is at least one asian language in there that would be cool. But I guess their wide asian product selection speaks for the asianness of the supermarket. 

There are definitely some good deals here and there, but of course I noticed some things that are more expensive than other places. 

A major thing that persuades me to go to any supermarket is the atmosphere... And I felt weird in this supermarket. I thought it would be a cleaner more proper version of an asian supermarket, but no, I was disappointed. I heard hacking/spitting of phlegm by a worker near the produce area. Then I saw a mop in a bucket at the salted fish area. The mop was under a shelf of salted fish and also beside a bucket of salted fish. I also find the fluorescent lighting to be very blinding...

My husband is Italian and his father owned to traditional Italian restaurants in our home town.  That being said,  we still appreciate the modern twist to Italian too; however, this was neither.  They make their own pasta-  but it's is sticky, tastless and chewy.  It was aweful.  My husband and I both got pasta dishes and on both-  they cook forgot things that were supposed to be cooked into the pasta.  My huband got a spinach pasta,  the guy forgot to cook it in-  so his thought-  put the pasta from the plate back in the skillet,  add in the spinach and mix it around a couple of times.  Needless to say,  it was like cold raw spinach leaves with your hot pasta-- didn't really go.  The other thing-  no one is coming around and refilling drinks or taking your plates or bringing you your food-  so why would you have that massive clear box for tip money (right where the hostess is) when you go up to pay.  It just seemed tacky. 

You can't have it both ways-  either you are like a deli where you order at the counter and get your food- or have someone come around and at least refill your drinks, bus your tables (which was not done) and making sure everything is okay. 

I think this place has potential - but it just totally misses the mark.  The other thing-  if you want a drink-  you've go to go to the bar to order it,  then you have to go to this line for this,  then this line for that-  just doesnt make that much sense to me.",2

Do you really think that the customers that frequented your establishment are going to think that the decrease in value is worth it now because you put some fresh rosemary in a tiny vase at each table and planted some lettuce out front? I got news for you field kitchen...you are digging yourself in deep this time. Oh and the tip you slipped in to everybody's check? Classy touch.",2
15112,2,1546560000000,"I've been waiting for Meet Fresh to open since they were advertised half a year to a year ago. With such a long wait and seeing their photos on instagram, I was excited to try their Taiwanese dessert.

I was slightly disappointed with my meal for the price I paid. I ordered the hot herbal jelly with tapioca, mini taro balls, peanuts, taro, and red bean. Overall the flavours were decent. Not too sweet and a big enough portion. The taro balls were mini so I didn't get the chewy texture that i would've liked. The peanuts came on the side so that was a nice touch. Herbal jelly was smooth but not much flavour altogether with the rest. Taro were big chunks.

I went with a friend when they first opened so we got the mochi for free. I would not recommend them as it's expensive and you end up getting 8 small pieces of mochi the size of your finger. That being said, for the dish to be over 5 dollars, they did not resemble Japanese mochi but rather Chinese rice cake. Texture was soft but not like that of mochi. The white one is better than the dark one as the dark one had some weird chemical like after taste. This was not worth it even when it was free.

Overall, not sure if I would go back as I prefer the other Taiwanese dessert places on yonge. 

My friend also ordered their drink and was not completely satisfied. Perhaps I will come and try their drinks but for now, this would not be my first choice.",1

They also have a wine special on Wednesdays for only $8 a glass. We had the wild boar sliders and the salami pizza. The sliders were outstanding. I really liked the patio and the ambiance inside.

This isnt the restaurants fault but my table of three other 20 somethings kept getting death glares from the middle aged people in the room. Whats that about?

Saturday at 3pm: Our waitress was friendly and attentive. Service was prompt. Atmosphere was laid back. Trio of dips was pretty tasty gotta say quite filling for two. The chips were good. They were halved (flower?) tortillas, deep fried in house I'm pretty sure (they were still warm and shiny when they got to us). 

I had the house enchiladas plate vegetarian style. Tasty but greasy. The rice and beans seemed over salted to me. My boyfriend had the tacos plate via shrimp.  He was super impressed with the food (he's not a Mexican Foodie like me though). The presentation was nice. We had a couple happy hour drinks which were OK.

I thought the food overall was a bit greasy and salty.  Granted, Mexican style food are not really known for being healthy. The only reason I ordered the dips and enchiladas was that this was the tail-end of our vacation and I was still ignoring the proper nutritional ratios meals should contain.

The problem I had was the bartenders and the lack of music.  On a Saturday night you'd think the bartenders would be in a good mood.  They weren't and their attitudes took something away from what should have been a great bar scene.

15210,3,1546473600000,"When looking for a restaurant there are three things that make me want to come back more than once. First, it has to be food that we cannot easily make at home. Second, the quality of product has to be exceptional. Last, it has to be reasonably priced for what you get.
So far to date there is only one restaurant in the Las Vegas valley that exceeds all of my three criteria; it's called Café De Japon. It seems that I am not the only one that feels this way.
I first heard about them in the Las Vegas weekly. The restaurant is clean and open. With minimal seating they can probably seat 90 people if they squeeze everyone in. It is warm and inviting. The chef who is also the owner greats you when you first walk in from behind the counter, he takes the time to learn your name. One of the three staff that they have will seat you either at a table or at one of the counter seats. At the counter you can watch the chef prepare the cold dishes, like sushi or Carpaccio. 
The owner only brings in the best of ingredients. The restaurant has a regular menu but the specials are what you should come to this place for. They have a big white board with all kinds of words written on it, a lot of them you will not recognize. I had to ask the chef a few times how to pronounce and describe what goes into the special dishes. With these specials he brings in fish from other countries and states. Fish that we cannot easily obtain at home in our local grocery store. That meets my first criteria of a restaurant that I'd like to return to.
 The chef will not serve any of this fish unless he would eat it himself. The freshest vegetables are used. The quality of meat is superior to anything that I could buy in the super market. They also have a variety of drinks like a yuzu soda. I have never had this drink anywhere else in my life and would not even know where to begin to look for it anywhere else. It's made from a fruit called a yuzu fruit. It is so exotic that it is only found in remote parts of East Asia.
While many reviews online say that the restaurant is overpriced, I think the cost is worth it. I leave full and every time I feel like I've had one of the best meals of my life for under eighty dollars. I know it seems that eighty dollars is a lot of money for two people to eat, but the different flavors and textures that you get to have is worth it. The quality is great, the price is reasonable and the food is good quality. It meets all my criteria for returning to a restaurant, over and over.",3
15215,1,1546819200000,"Recently came across a list of the Top 50 'must eat at' restaurants in Toronto, so making it a mission to try them all - eventually.  Kingyo was one of these.  

Location/ambience:
- Located just off Parliament in Cabbagetown, we lucked out and got a spot right out front of the place, so can't complain - but then again it was around 9pm so you might need to park further if you come early.  Nicely decorated inside, louder than most restaurants, and you're greeted quite openly when you arrive.  So far so good..

Food/price:
- Took the advice from several other reviewers in deciding what to get, so here's the rundown:

- TAKE WASABI - got a split of half hot, half cold octopus with seaweed wrap.  The cold was a little slimy (which I expected) but also very chewy (which was a negative).  The hot was much better - if you're trying it, get the hot.  Not a great value but makes for a nice starter.

- TUNA-TATAKI WITH PONZU JELLY - bar none best dish of the night.  Get it.  The tuna just melts in your mouth and the jelly is amazing.  Don't question it - just get it.

- STONE GRILLED BEEF TONGUE - for $10, it's expensive.  You get maybe 8-12 pieces of very thinly sliced beef to cook on a hot stone, with a few condiments (oil, hot paste) for dipping.  High on novelty so was neat to try - do it if you want to try something different, not if you want to get full..

- CHICKEN KARAAGE with magic powder - ok I'm guessing the 'magic powder' is just salt, pepper, and MSG - but who knows.  It was good - the chicken is dark, juicy, and has some gristle to it (which I like but you might not), and has a great batter.  Most Western-feeling dish of the night

- PORK BELLY - very fatty, but so good.  Scraped off most of the top fat and had the rest (though I admit it was tempting to eat the fat too, it was that good..)

- SHORT RIB - last dish of the night, and it was BIG.  Nice and tender and with a great sweet dark sauce, if you weren't full before this, you'll be full after you're done..

Overall:
- Definitely enjoyed the range of different dishes.  Price-wise, it's not the greatest value, especially the Take Wasabi and Beef Tongue, but until I compare some other places on the 'Top 50' (Guu, I'm looking at you..), I'll reserve judgment over whether I'll return again.",1

15230,1,1548806400000,"This place is a lot worse than I remember....

I used to come here before they changed everything up. It was the perfect Italian lunch spot - excellent location, solid food, great service. But it seems that Locale Mercatto is now a shell of its former self.

For starters, and as others have mentioned, the entrance is hard to find. 

The menu is a lot worse. They no longer do pizzas. They do panini sandwiches but if you ask me, that's practically a write-off when you go to an Italian restaurant.

They used to bring fresh bread to your table, they no longer do this. They even used to offer fresh parmesan with their pastas; you guessed it, they no longer do this either.

I chose to eat the Spaghetti di Mare. It was okay, a little blander than expected. In fact, if you compare the picture of my dish to other reviewers, mine looks much drier and less creamy. 

Where it really went downhill was when a couple friends ordered the dish consisting of salmon and rice. It was lukewarm at best, so we asked a server if it was supposed to be hot. She said yes, so we let her know that it wasn't. She offered to have the kitchen remake it, but instead, they seemed to just throw the food in a pan, mushing everything together, breaking down the salmon. Not a big deal since we're not ones to complain, but it seemed unprofessional to get re-served a dish that looked the way it did (see picture). Plus, we really didn't need the added attitude from the other server (2 people were serving us).

Simply put, avoid this place.",2

This surgery center was efficient, professional & personable.  They immediately greeted me at reception, asked if I needed anything and started the procedures for checking me in.  All personnel who took care of me were excellent!  A nurse named Judy came out, asked me a few questions, told me she would have the pleasure of caring for me & put me at ease.  Once inside the triage area, Claudia also started taking care of me.  She had some trouble with the IV, but she got it in on the second try.  Which was a huge positive because my veins NEVER cooperate.  The last surgery I had somewhere else, they couldn't get the IV in and tried multiple, painful times & finally had to put it in my neck.  It only took Claudia 2 tries and it didn't hurt a bit.  My doctor, who performed my surgery,has been taking care of me for years and he did an excellent job as usual.  The nurse who took care of me in recovery was wonderful too, unfortunately I cannot remember her name.  Before leaving the surgery center, Judy came over to me and bent down, touching her forehead to mine and said, ""Thank you so much for allowing me to take care of you today"".  The extra care and concern they showed me, made such an impression on me.  I will definitely request that center if/when I need another surgery, and I highly recommend them to friends and family.",2

First of all, was a little nervous about bringing the little one, however we went early (4:45pm) and the hostess did not seem to be ruffled a bit at our presence. I had read that it may not be great for kids (was happily surprised!)--though I could see that later this place might be for date nights and parties sans kids, so the earlier the better IMO. I don't have a refined pallet therefore don't want to go into each dish except to say they were freaking delicious! The chicken skins were amazing (covered in Honey....I know, so good), and the dessert donut was UNREAL. So,so good!! The highlight for me was the Old Fashioned (5$ on H.H) and the meatballs with grits. I do eat low carb and will admit I had to make a game-time decision to have a mid-week cheat meal, but other than that--no complaints. So happy with our time here, and maybe next time we will get a babysitter and an Uber and really take advantage of the cocktail menu!",1

I ordered the tofu rice bowl. The tofu is fried with a lovely skin on it and topped with a very nice sauce. However, beyond those, the tofu had very little flavor, and it was very moist. I would have liked to see it lightly marinated or some moisture pressed out of it. Plus there wasn't nearly enough of that awesome sauce.

The bowl was topped with steamed broccoli and carrots (neither seasoned), a very well made ramen egg (this is NOT a vegan dish unless you explicitly request it), and some very tasty pickles (I think it was a root vegetable of some sort, but I didn't ask). The rice was boring old white rice.

There were a bunch of amazing elements to this dish that I absolutely loved, but they were muted by the very bland tofu, rice, and steamed vegetables, which made for a fairly bland dish altogether. I do not recommend the tofu rice bowl, at least until it is improved.",2

Once translated everything sounded delicious, but I settled on the ricotta and bread, especially after hearing that their bread was baked in house.

15409,1,1547769600000,"After a one star experience at this place and a subsequent talk with the manager, we were invited to give this restaurant another try. This review is based only on our second visit.
Our waiter was very attentive, but did not have the best knowledge about the wine menu. The wine menu is great and they have so many different kind of wines all over the world - that is remarkable. But in my opinion I should not get a recommendation from the waiter for a wine that he can not find on the wine menu and request me to do the search. We finally came to a conclusion and got our choice of wine served. He showed me the bottle, opened it, gave me the cork and wanted to pour the wine. There was no wine decanter he brought with himself and we had no wine glasses. But what was he doing??? He took two glasses from the free table next to us, instead of taking them from the bar or kitchen. You can not do like this in an upscale restaurant. We still had no wine decanter and got our wine poured into our glasses. Dear waiter, please learn how to hold a wine bottle, when you pour in. It is a $150 wine bottle and not a plastic bottle of purified water. Ok, enough complaints - our overall experience turned out very well... Some minutes later we got our Appetizer. It was the Prime Filet Carpaccio, made of the finest and highest quality products - top notch. The overall taste from the mustard dressing was a little bland, but still an excellent Appetizer. We could not wait for our entree. We both ordered the dry aged bone-in Filet Mignon medium rare with the complimetary bernaise, peppercorn and bordelaise sauces with macaroni and cheese and cheddar and onion scallop potatoes for the sides. I have to state that I got the best steak ever in my life. This is the place for having a steak - I am more than 100% sure. Some words to the sauces, but do not understand them as a complaint, just as a statement. All three sauces tasted delicious. After talking to our waiter, we got the information from him, that it was not a real bernaise sauce, but tasted still outstanding. The bordelaise sauce tasted for me a little bit too much after burned sugar (more in the licorice direction), but had its own oustanding taste. The peppercorn sauce was absolutely brilliant and my personal favorite. After this excellent meal we had no room for a dessert, we just ordered two espressi. Unfortunately the espressi did not have any crema on top and the taste was not rich. It must have come from be the used beans, because the machine they have is first class. So, thank you again for this outstanding food experience. My wife and I decided, if we come back to Las Vegas we will stay for sure in the M again and visit Anthonys Prime Steak and Seafood for dinner.

Don't judge me, but because everything sounded so good, I also got a 3 option plate plus a protein: red chili sweet potatoes, Indian spiced cauliflower, green beans & snap peas, & chicken as my protein choice. Everything tasted incredible!

Special shout out & thanks to Courtney, who took my order. She was super patient while I figured out what to eat (so many great options), answered my millions of questions (food restrictions/ingredients), & was just all around so sweet (also told me about the CA location)!

The constant berating of upgrades is what took the most time at the counter

Then she really pushed hard on the the Fuel Option.  I told her I probably wouldn't even use 1/2 a tank of gas that we were only in town for a few days.  She promised me that whatever fuel I didn't use would be refunded to me, even wrote down that the pre-payed fuel option was $45.34 and if I returned the car with 1/2 a tank that I would see a $22.67 credit on my rental (of course she didn't give me that written example).  She swore it was automatic and I had nothing to lose, so I gave in and did it.  Low and behold when I get my rental record (it was emailed because their computers were down when I returned the car) there was no credit, and even though I returned the car with over 1/2 a tank of gas the receipt stated I returned it with 1/8 of tank.  I called and corrected them on the fuel reading and am then informed that in order to have the Fuel Option refunded you must return with a full tank of gas, otherwise it is forfeit.  

Needless to say I held my ground and got the partial refund, but I find it shameful that their counter employees are either liars or ignorant of their company's policies.  I tend to believe the former as they obviously make some sort of commission off of the up-sells.

Luckily, this Mesa location was only @ 5 miles away, and they were open until 11:30pm that night, so it worked out even better for us. 

Admission was only $1 per person on Halloween evening for those in costume, which we all were.  We still had to pay regular price for the skate rental ($3.50), but at $4.50 per person, it was a great deal.

The skates were ok; the wheels felt a little ""off"" but I was able to work with them. Nice rink and the music selection was good; they played a mixture of current pop hits to throwback R&B and  pop 80s.  

I'm not sure if it was because it was later in the evening or because it was Halloween, but there weren't a lot a kids, which is a major plus in my book.  

The girls enjoyed the snack bar. They ordered pizza, pretzels, cotton candy, churros, and Icees.  Prices were decent and not too over-priced. 

Also, there was a police officer on-duty and standing outside in the parking lot when we arrived.  I still feel new to PHX.  I don't know the areas and neighbors outside of where I live and work, so I don't know if the security was due to the 'hood, or just general practice.  Either way, I did feel secure knowing that someone was watching over the cars that late in the evening. 

My biggest complaint here is that the employees' friends were on the rink doing some dangerous stunts (flips, handstands, etc while on their skates!), pretty much the whole night.  It posed a risk to other skaters, especially the younger kids, and it encouraged younger kids to mimic the behavior.  Not to mention, it's a major risk to whomever owns this venue.",2

First of all, there was no staff- just one young lady attempting to do about 4 jobs. This place needs proper staffing in a big way. She was the cashier, bartender, waiter, etc. 
We ordered a large pizza with 2 toppings, well done. It arrived, not well done, WITHOUT sauce!!!!!!!!!!. The most tasteless, dryest, horrible pie I ever had!!!!!

I had done research so I knew what it was about & I checked the Yelp reviews for this location & they were all excellent so I decided to take the plunge!

This place is a little hard to find in MGM - it's in the ""Underground"".  The girls at the front desk were most helpful in my questions in trying to determine the best infusion for me - I went for the Megaboost - lots of vitamins.

You are brought into an exam room where your vitals are checked by people who are paramedics or licensed to administer needles.  Everything was sanitary & as if I was in a doctor's office.

Once they hooked me up with the IV, I was given a choice of a room w/movies in it or just regular TV which is what I went for.  I got a bottle of water.  During the infusion, I felt cold but that was it - no pain or anything.

After the infusion I felt like I had gotten a great night of sleep even though I hadn't as I never sleep in hotel rooms & I had energy.  The feeling lasted for 24 hours.   I would definitely do it again!  Go ahead - give it a try!",2

Negatives would include a very very loud atmosphere, with music and customer sounds that made it impossible to carry on a conversation without yelling and lip-reading.  I did ask the manager to turn the music down a tad during the time we were there, and she obliged willingly, although conversation was still mostly impossible. The place was very busy, packed with people and with a couple of birthday parties going on.

Our waitperson was excellent but the servers failed us.  Two of the 14 meals at the table didn't arrive for many many MANY minutes after the rest of us were served.  Being polite, I waited to start eating until everyone was served, therefore my otherwise delicious braised beef was cold by the time I got to it.  The two late dinners also arrived cold, meaning they had been sitting somewhere unattended before anyone noticed that they needed to be delivered.  A complaint was given to the very attentive manager and she made it right, taking the late meals off the bill and providing the entire table with a platter of desserts.

The food was excellent and we were taken care of in the long run.  Would not mind trying it again if the opportunity arises, maybe on a less busy weekday.",2

The bartender that served us (who was quite rude and obviously hates her life, her job and would have rather been watching the game than waiting on us) assured us that the chili chips were a large portion and plenty for two people. Ha! There were 12 chips covered with what tasted like Hormel chili. Horrible. We couldn't finish them, but that had absolutely nothing to do with the tiny, overpriced portion size. As far as the BBQ goes.. We had the pulled pork. Being born and raised in NC, I've had a lot of BBQ in my lifetime. This was by far the worst I've ever had. Flavorless, greasy, fatty, just plain bad.

TIP: In case you want 1 free dessert during your visit, you have to show a posted Yelp review to your server! Just SHOW it!

Location (4/5): The restaurant locates in a corner of a big plaza. Watch out for the big Gangnam sign! From the outside, the restaurant looks pretty dark but it becomes divey when you walk inside.

Services (5/5): We came at 7pm in a party of 7 and quickly get situated! Our server was very friendly. She was also quick at prepping for our BBQ and bringing out side dishes! Since we came in a large group, they also helped us to calculate 18% gratitude fee in the bill. 

Food (4/5): You have the choices of ordering individual dishes or order a set such as Las Vegas, Meat Lover, Gangnam (#1 bestseller) and Premium (best cuts). All sets come available for 2, 4 or 6 people with different prices. We ordered Meat Lover for 4 people for a party of 6 adults and 1 child. The portions were huge! It also came with complimentary side dishes, miso soups, rice bowls, salads and dumplings. It was more than enough for us! We also ordered the Kobe Beef Carpaccio ($9.95) and Salmon Carpaccio ($7.95). The Kobe beef was literally melting in my mouth! Soooooo sofffttt! The salmon, on the other hand, added a hint of freshness in a jungle of grilled meat! For dessert, we shared a vanilla macaron ice cream from Brick's! They have the macaron ice cream fridge right at the door, so give it a try if you need a togo dessert!

I realize what they are really doing is offering unusual sushi. I ordered spring rolls, sushi pizza, green dragon roll, sushi sliders and a kimchi/beef roll. (two very adventurous choices and two sushi choices, while non-traditional but more common sushi choices) 

I had no idea what to expect with sushi sliders - they are blocks of rice with a wedge of salmon inside. Unusual but not bad. The Kimchi roll was a disaster, really does not taste good. While I knew this roll would have been hard to pull off, I gotta say as someone who makes his own bulgogi and homemade kimchi, both were worse than I make myself. I had to throw some of this out, which is a big minus for me. The Sushi pizza was actually very cheap at 4.50, but it wasn't covered in topping. It was cut in fours making it impossible to manipulate with chopsticks. The Green Dragon Roll and Spring Rolls were perfectly fine, and gave me hope that many of their other items might be adequate. Having to throw away sushi because I didn't like it, would be enough for this to merit one star, but I have to concede its a highly experimental roll so I knew I might not like it. I would choose someone else for either price or quality.

I would not recommend it and would not order from this place again.",1

Greg assured me, yes, he could, so I ordered it.
We watched him work his magic, first he heavily sugared a martini glass rim, then got a glass shaker cup and added a good 2 ounces of Captain Morgan Spiced Rum, a hit of pre-made sweet & sour mix and a hit of Triple Sec.
For the record a proper Sidecar is a simple drink, 3 ingredients; Cognac, fresh lemon juice and Cointreau.
We proceeded to tell Greg we weren't sure what he had just concocted but one thing was certain, it was not a Sidecar. To our shock, he insisted it was and basically said we were wrong. I suggested he Google the drink. He was totally arrogant, rather than leave the bar I ordered a Stella Artois, which he promptly rang up and put a bill in front of me even though we were playing video poker. I waited for some type of apology that never came.

Avoid this place, nice décor only goes so far, the staff is untrained, lacking basic spirits knowledge and worse, arrogant. There are so many better bars within walking distance.",2

When we were waiting to be seat, and finally 2 girls come, but they are too busy at chating, and just ignore us. when I tell one of the girl we have 2 babies, she show me a look that she dosen't want us to eat in this restaurant, and tell me there's no table for us while there are all empty tables. I don't understand, my babies are super quite, not make any noise, even if customer's baby is loud, don't you think her attitude is still not appropriate. When we asking a high chairs, 1 of the high chair is oily and have some food in there, we ask if she can help us clean it, and she told me it's already clean, OMG, are you blind, I don't want to say something like this, but this girl really ruin my dinner.

Also, the other two photos had problems. A dark red which was a prominent part of another photo came in bright red. Also, all of the photos were reportedly in excellent resolution according to their online system, but the third landscape photo is blurry and looks impressionist.

Sake Rok is fun. It's vibrant. It's lively. It's delicious. It's just overall a great place to be. If I wanted to recommend a place to be for an occasion, Sake Rok would be perfect. 

The staff break out in song and dance every now and then. There's an MC (shoutout to Jonnis--I love you and you're amazing) who interacts with the guests and really makes the place alive. If you're lucky, you may even get pulled up to dance :)

Food - 5/5 I can't tell you how much I enjoyed the food here. There's definitely a unique touch to it, such as the edamame and the peppers you're given in the beginning. The sashimi tastes fresh and melts in my mouth. The sushi rolls were all amazing! I had one dish that involved mushrooms & steak and it was ah-may-zingggg. Overall, all loved the food!

Drinks - 5/5 Okay the cocktails are typical strip price so don't be scared. It tastes amazing. The staff really gave me great recommendations, drink after drink!

By now, if you read my reviews, you know that I am vegan and I don't eat gluten. This makes dining out quite an issue at times, especially for breakfast/brunch. 

I really wanted to hit up The Vig Uptown for brunch because I like it as a Happy Hour spot, the space is incredible, it is within a bike ride from my house, and I love the Original Vig, but alas, there was nothing on the menu to accommodate me. I gently mentioned in person and a few times on FaceBook that having some sort of tofu scrambler would really improve their menu.

They listened.
They created.
They named. (after me!!!)

We stopped by for brunch this past Sunday for the dishes debut, and got a personal hello from Tucker. He was excited because they had already sold TEN AMber Scramblers that morning and it isn't even officially on the menu yet! I'm already a star!

So, whats the verdict on the AMber Scrambler? Amazing. Seriously. The thing that really sets this apart from other scrambler dishes is sun dried tomatoes. They bring such a delicious flavor! It certainly doesn't hurt that it comes with their signature guac and a side of pico.

I'll be here every weekend for the delicious dish and the $5 fresh squeezed mimosas! If you know whats good for you, you will too.",2
15770,3,1548806400000,"I popped by here quickly for lunch the other day as I had some errands to run on the weekend. Came in for lunch around noon on a Saturday and it was getting busy, but luckily there was still a table available for me so i got seated right away. 

They have a lot of choices for the ramen noodles, particularly in terms of the broth there were definitely a few selections. It looked like the hokkaido ramen seems to be one of their top contenders, so I decided to try that along with a side of gyozas. For their ramen they had 2 sizes and I got the regular size.

The gyozas were pretty good, nicely fried and it was hot, the dipping sauce was nice on the side but I just dipped a little bit otherwise it would be too salty.

The ramen was amazing! For this shop I would definitely says i'ts a hidden gem coz there are certainly a lot of restaurant options in the area, but i was quite surprised to find this place their ramen is certainly more than decent. I love the hoikkado broth - i did drink it and i even packed some home LOL. I was worried it would be too milky for me, but it worked quite well along with the thickness of the pork bone broth and the combo together was just lovely. Ramen was springy and had nice texture to it and I felt the price is quite reasonable for a bowl of ramen this size. 

All in all, I was quite pleased with my discovery and I would say this is definitely a neighbourhood gem and should I be back in this area again in the future I would definitely consider coming here again!",1

15773,2,1546387200000,"Before checking into the ""resort"" I read a few bad reviews, mostly about money being stolen, no hot water and rude staff. I thought I'd go in with an open mind. I was wrong..this place would be great with a little TLC. 

CONS:

1. Staff is not nice / not rude...inbetween I guess. 

2. No hot water in shower, water is just room temp. Not warm either. 

3. Hallways smell like a combination of weed and cigarettes. (Hotel staff can't control that, I understand that) so no biggie. 

4. Room smells like cigarette and febreeze, but the smell goes away when the A.C. is on. 

5. Pubic hair inside the hot tub. 

6. Dust all over counters and tables.

7. Wall plugs are loose, so if you charge your phone or plug something in, make sure the plug does not fall out of the wall.

8. Front door to hotel room does not close all the way, it locks shut but there is a large gap between the door frame and door. 

9. Toilet paper in the room was halfway used when we checked in. 

10. Carpet on floor is ripped. 

11. NO dressers on room, so your living out of your suitcase until you leave. 

12. Entry gates from parking do not work or open,  so you have to park on one side of the property just to get to the opposite side. When we informed hotel staff the gate isn't working they just said ""it acts weird and it's every other gate that works""

13. Ants all over the outdoor ice machine.

14. Parking is kind of sketchy, no lighting, behind the building, bunch of homeless people hanging out in that area. 

15. Shower head hangs on the ceiling forcing you to get your hair wet, also making it awkward to get a good clean. 

PROS:

1. The mattresses are comfortable
2. Tv's are nice and clear 
3. A.C. works great.",2

15788,3,1547769600000,"Westgate survives as a bar and restaurant district not because of the 41 nights a year the Coyotes play at Jobing.com Arena, but because this is the only place to hang out west of Central.  Virtually every retailer at Westgate has closed up shop, and the only businesses that survive are bars and restaurants that generate most of their profit from alcohol sales.  Tanger Outlets is just another ho-hum outlet mall, and with 4 outlet malls now competing in the Phoenix area, Tanger's long term success is less than assured.

I usually visit Westgate early in the evening, taking advantage of the happy hour deals at Yardhouse, in fact Yardhouse is the only Establishment in Westgate City Center that I have actually dined at.  That may change when Buffalo Wild Wings opens.  When I consider staying later into the evening, I notice some of the clientele and am reminded that Desert Sky is only 4 miles away.

Another glaring example of Westgate's early decline is the content of Steve Ellman's billboards.  The area could be a Times Square west if the content of the billboards was luxury electronics, cars, cosmetics etc.  The sad reality is that half the billboards are for Gila River Casinos, and even the exact price of cremation is advertised on one of  the billboards.

The new lease agreement for the Coyotes includes a minimum $15 parking fee at Westgate during events at Jobing.com Arena.  The impact of this charge on Westgate's price sensitive clientele will probably be substantial, along with the amount of traffic at Westgate, and may force out several marginal businesses.   I haven't seen any details of how and where the parking fees will be collected, so I will update this review once the parking fees go into effect.",2

This school is absolutely awful. The ""core"" classes are a joke. The teachers either don't know what they're teaching or just don't care. You can pass without even learning a think because every quiz and exam is open book. They don't teach you shit. They read off power points and when you get off topic there's no chance you'll get back on the subject you're supposed to be learning. Now as far as the actual program sick as surg tech, OT, criminal justice, nursing... Completely different story. I am only speaking  on the Nursing program. It blows. This schools nursing program is 1. You pay a lot more money, it's EXPENSIVE AS FUCK. 2. It's inly one class a month, which sounds cool. But if you're paying $50,000 for a ADN you should have more than 11 days of school. 3. THEY ARE NOT ACCREDITED. I repeat THEY ARE NOT ACCREDITED. Lastly, don't piss off these instructors. The only cool professors were obviously the ones I didn't have. Lab is awful, you sit there trying not to fall asleep because the teachers go on and on and on and onnnnnn. Also DONT act like yourself, She'll tell you that you need to act like an ""adult"" if she doesn't like the way you're doing basically anything. These people don't care. Are you sick? Do you have the flu, or something contagious? That's okay go to school anyways, because if you don't they'll automatically fail you. Oh and when you'll call EVERYONE on campus to ask if missing a day will fail you, everyone will say they don't know, they don't have an answer for you, they don't think so but they aren't sure... But it'll blow up in your face anyways because these people don't know what the fuck they're doing. Just don't even think about getting sick, just live in a bubble because they think you can completely control when you get sick or not and if you're in their nursing program you cannot ever get sick. Ever. Also don't tell them that your mother does anything for you, you need to be an adult and make your own decisions, they'll be very disappoints if you don't and ITS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. They will also low key insult you if you don't look like you're ""healthy"" (ex. Poor diet, not enough exercise) aka if you're of a bigger statue. Just don't go here, ever. Please find another school that doesn't completely fucking suck. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS SCHOOL IS THE FINANCIAL AID. My financial advisor was awesome.

15804,2,1547510400000,"First off, the drinks we ordered were wrong. Iced teas turned into iced water, seriously.. water.. with ice. 

Second, we had little to no communication with our waitress (lourdes). We weren't ever checked on by our waitress(lourdes). A different waitress who was working the tables to the left of us was very nice to give us refills and check on us from time to time. I wish I caught her name so I could mention how great she was.

Third, when we first walked in, we asked the host if they do anything special for birthdays (for my niece) and he said yes fried ice cream and we sing happy birthday.  My niece loves Garcia's bean dip so we took her there for her 6th birthday. Towards the end of our dinner we had to ask the other waitress who had been helping us all night, since Lourdes was nowhere to be found, to have them sing HBD to my niece and bring the ice cream. Lo and behold! It's Lourdes, she just hands my niece the ice cream and faintly says happy birthday while walking away. So we decided to sing the song to my niece ourselves. The kids were so well behaved the entire dinner too!! She was most excited for the singing part!

Finally,  once it was time to pay, that's when Lourdes was attentive and nice. Like, where were you this entire dinner!? So I paid and left only 15% tip due to the lack of hospitality shown. Once we start driving off of the parking lot, we noticed that my nephew had forgotten his godzilla action figure there (keep in mind, it had only been 3 mins and we were still in the car). After searching the car we went into the restaurant and asked to check the table for it. The table had been cleaned and there was no godzilla in sight. We know for a fact that it was left on the table because we were gone for literally 3 minutes!! My guess is that she threw it away based on the amount of tip that was left due to her wonderfully award winning customer service!!! **take a whiff of that sarcasm** We will never be going back to this place again!!! 

It's one thing to have crappy service, but at least have decent food to make up for it.

So thanks Lourdes for ruining our days and my nephew's life. I now have to listen to him cry until toys r us opens in the morning.

We had a very large party, and George gave us a quote in advance.  The bill far exceeded the quote, even though we were served what we were quoted, and nothing more. 
 
The dips were the best part of the meal, but far too little pita to enjoy - and we felt like we were being a bother by asking for more.  George and his staff appeared annoyed even though we were very respectful and simply didn't want the delicious dips to be wasted!  It's not like we were trying to fill up on bread, we had already paid for the entire meal.  We also opted for a baklava dessert @ $3 per person.  It was maybe a 1/4 piece of baklava each... sincerely disappointing.  As a big, fat Greek group, we were expecting the food to taste authentic.  It didn't.  Some of the worst pastitsio I've ever had - and cold, too.  If he did use lamb, I feel awful that the lamb died to end up in that dish.

Also got the little container of overly priced fruit flavored jelly, one lychee + guava flavor and another mango flavor.....$4.95 each....finished it in less than a minute....scraped every last drop, not because it tasted amazing but because it was so expensive that even the scrapings were probably worth $0.50. Also got the vanilla souffle with chocolate sauce at $8.95. The souffle is made fresh to order and it took them probably around $15 minutes to make. Is it worth the wait?.....Not really. The souffle was very light and airy but when you dug deep into the souffle it was mushy and soggy like eating pudding. All this came to about $26 after tax. 

At the end I was handed a stamp card so that every time you visit you can receive a stamp and when you get 5 stamps you get some kind of discount....(I didn't really pay attention to what she was saying so not sure what you get when you fill up all 5 stamps).

Their maguro and chutoro are fresh and I love how they serve it on a bowl of fresh ice to keep it cool. 
One of our go to dish is their chicken steak. As everything on their menu, this is also a dish full of flavor. What's becoming my favorite appetizer is their fried chicken skin. All I can say is YUM!!! It is fried to crispy perfection and again seasoned well with garlic salt. It's comparable to chicharon. 
What I didn't get to take a picture of was their special which was a marinated beef skirt steak. Omg!!! The best dish of the night. Nicely cooked to medium rare and so tender and fu of Japanese BBQ flavor. Anyone that has bbq'd skirt steak know it's not always an easy task as you need to also cut against the grain to keep it juicy and they definitely got this dish right. 
The staff is always friendly and courteous and it's pretty easy to be seated without reservations. This is one of my highly recommend spot if you're ever nearby Chinatown. 
The majority of the dishes are small portion size reminiscent of a tapas style so be prepared to spend some money but not a crazy amount if you like variety like we do.",2

15891,2,1548201600000,"Hmmm... I wanted to like Cabo so much! But sadly, my sister and I's visit on Friday night fell short from the get go, but wasn't a Pompei-esque meltdown either.

I believe the sour taste started as we waited about 2-3 minutes for anyone to notice us standing at the ""wait to be seated"" sign, despite the place being 3/4 empty. 

When we got seated, it was obvious our poor waitress was having an off night for whatever reason, but she dropped some chips and ""salsa?"" with us, and took our orders in a decent time frame so all was well with me. Now the ""salsa"" is DUMB. Lacking in flavor, tomatoes and spice, this is basically a cup of corn with a few diced tomatoes and some parsley on top. At least that's what it tasted like. Seriously, bring me some damn salsa, none of this corny junk. Turns out though, if you want some salsa, cough up $3.95 and expect it to be green. :'( Not cool, IMO!

I got the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos and it was moist and a good portion, but the white sauce everyone is commenting left me asking ""where is it?"". I mean, it was definitely on there but I couldn't taste a thing. Sad day. My sister chose the steak wrap and she didn't say a word from first bite to last and that says it all! :D

As sides, she got black beans and rice which she didn't eat much of, and I tried the jalepeno mashers which are basically chunky mashed potatoes with diced jalepenos and unmelted cheese on top. Weak attempt at a side, guys. Get with it.

For $20, it was ok but I won't be rushing back soon.",2

Le menu est original et composé de classiques revisités tels que yogurt au granola mais aussi des saucisses faites maison, crème de maïs, viennoiseries qui sont présentées dans une vitrine et sui sont tellement appétissantes etc...
L'ambiance est détendue, le cadre très 'frais', reposant. Ce lieu convient aussi bien a une rencontre en famille, qu'entre amis ou même seul.
J'ai vraiment aimé le décor. Le service est amical, rapide et les serveuses ont été capables de m'aiguiller vers des choix ok pour la prise en compte de mes allergies alimentaires. Il y avait une crème de maïs avec des choses dessus et j'ai vraiment aimé. 
C'était au mois de juillet et nous avons facilement trouvé des places pour nous garer dans la rue. Pas sure si c'est toujours le cas mais en tout cas c'était bien pratique!
J'y retournerai sans hésiter.",2

When we first arrived we were greeted by the manager he walked us up to the top floor where the male review was and told us we had the choice of seats wherever we wanted.  We were also given two drink coupons per person so we ordered a drink and got seated. The show started off slowly but what I really liked is the guys came out to sit and talk to you, also they were really cool about taking pictures. By the end of the night it was so crowded but it was amazing had the best time I definitely will be back. I hope soon.",2
15920,3,1548806400000,"I was local to this place doing some other shopping and my phone suggested it, having never been here I wasn't sure if it was a pub with minimal food and mostly drinking. The inside is far bigger than it seems, has a great boat or lake house feel to it. The service was amazing, my server was responsive and when i asked for garnish removal, I didn't get a it on the side when the dish arrived; which to me equates attention to detail. Perhaps the owner, but an older gentleman was working the floor and assisting as backup, that impressed me. Normally a manager is far from the action or above lifting a plate. I ordered the chicken wings in a maple sauce and they were the best wings I have had in this neighborhood of over a year living here. Cooked to the bone not mostly, breaded and marinated evenly without excessive fat or breading to hide low quality chicken, just fantastic. I also had the lamb burger w/ sweet potato fries, the lamb was cooked perfectly and without the slightest bit of fat. The fries weren't over greasy and had more of a baked texture. Again very well prepared. I visited noon on a weekday if that helps.",2

15944,1,1546819200000,"This is my go to Nail salon in Vegas and Henderson. From my personal experience, I have not found a better place for nails. I only ever come in for a pedicure about every 2/3 weeks depending on how fast my nails grow. A regular pedicure is $30 which is a little more than the average nail salon, but I think it is worth it for the customer service provided and the ambiance. 

This place is definitely very busy and popular!! If you want to come here, I would recommend making an appointment at least a day in advance, but they usually do a great job at accommodating walk ins. Color selection is unbeatable for regular polish and gel! 

They have brand new massage chairs that are very comfortable and use sanitary materials as well. I have probably had services done by every nail technician and they all do a great job, but sometimes the process can be inconsistent from technician to technician. 

The only thing I sometimes mind about this location is that they're very pestering with the up-sell. They will ask you 10 times if you also want a manicure with your pedicure, if you want gel, or if you want your eyebrows done. Also, it's always very hectic in there and it's very evident that the employees are stressed out. It makes it difficult for me to relax when they are all running around frantically. It also seems they like to raise their prices, so beware if you are trying to save money. 

Despite this, I regularly recommend this salon to all of my friends and would recommend it to anyone who asks!",1

Tiny tiny pieces of steak.   Also the firecracker jalapeños were also small.  4 was all you got for $9 and they were not spicy at all.  Very plain.   2 other taco entrees were fine but sides are very small.  Mixed veggies were good and I had a side of them but also a small serving.  The food is good but not worth the money.",2

I usually ordered something ala carte because the salsa was the reason I was there.   The rest of the menu is simply ordinary in my opinion. Ordinary food is the reason they get 4 stars instead of 5. Still, I try and eat at Serrano's every time I'm on the east side of town since there are no locations west of Tempe.  I live 35 miles from the closest restaurant and still find a way to eat at one 5 or 6 times a year.  I'm amazed to see the same faces working there 10 years later too.

I sure haven't completely converted to a Macy's regular, but I do think that there's something to be gained from looking through sale racks. 

Also, of importance in my aversion: getting lost. I really have never understood how department stores like this are arranged. Nothing really makes sense to me. Trying to find your way around here will take longer than the actual shopping itself...or maybe I'm just confused all the time. Either way, I'd rather play in a corn field than go here looking for something in particular. On the same token, I'd NEVER try to brave holiday crowds here or come in a hurry. But, that's just me!

We ended up paying at the men's cologne station because everyone seemed to disappear when we wanted to get out! (In other words, go to Whole Foods for their Friday 5x7 event.)

Tables don't really get clean and the size of the restaurant is pretty small.

The instructor was really good at tailoring the exercises to each persons ability level and really made me work hard.

If you have a budget, I would recommend writing out a list and sticking to it or else you could easily go overboard. 
It's much more expensive than a place such as Walmart, but for good reason; you won't find things in Walmart that you can find here.

Ribs definitely good - savory, smokey, come off the bone easily. 4 stars. Mild critique, possibly a bit too lean, and as a result perhaps on the ever so slightly tough side of acceptable

Burnt ends sandwich - apparently quite good, based on my February 2013 notes. I do remember being rather satisfied with the trip and the food overall

Twice baked potato casserole - also February 2013, basically tastes like the inside of a twice baked potato, which is to say, pretty good

Polish sausage - rather good for what it is, and grows on you throughout the sandwich. Very good toasted french bread bun

Beans - eh, nothing to write home about

Chips and salsa - same, eh

Ambiance is similar to a new Denny's.  Looks like it is probably the all day dining restaurant, so no real ambiance.  Wait staff was good, and attentive, however they have a station where they put the cleared plates and it was right in front of us, which kind of grossed us out seeing dirty dishes stacked until they got taken away.  Presentation was boring, the menu is very limited and doesn't have anything on it that looked good (which is why I thought I would be safe with the NY Strip.....wrong!).  Couldn't wait to finish and leave, will not return and wouldn't recommend.  Wine list is extremely limited with selections I had never heard of, looked like it was almost an after thought to have a wine list.  The interior of the restaurant is just not anything special at all.  I think they should just market this place as somewhere the hotel guests can get breakfast and lunch and maybe close for dinner",2

16120,2,1548288000000,"I'll just start by saying I wish I would have read the Yelp reviews prior to going to Moon Valley Nursery.  The start of our experience wasn't bad - we waved down an employee for assistance with fruit tree selection.  We spent about 20-30 minutes  picking out about half a dozen different fruit trees and getting them tagged.  I started the conversation with the lady by telling her we were sent by our landscape company to choose the trees and that they would be picking them up for us.  She said we would need to pay for them if we wanted to leave the tags on them so we said fine, assuming we would get our landscaper's pricing since its a large company they work with on a regular basis.  No way.  This is where we should have engaged the common sense side of our brains instead of moving forward, not wanting to have to come back with our landscaper (save trips, people's time, etc.).  

on Monday I informed our guy that we had paid for the trees and it meant he would need to re-do our proposal.  I knew he was extremely busy so I thought I could make it easy on all of us by calling the sales person at MVN and ask if she could simply do a refund and that our guy would be back to buy the fruit trees and in addition get about 10 more trees and almost 100 shrubs.  Nope, sorry, I told you all sales are final (she didn't but I didn't argue-no point). The receipt does state that all sales are final but I thought since they still had the trees in their possession and our landscaper would be back to re-purchase them along with the additional trees and shrubs (quite a large amount in my world but maybe not to them) that they would see the simplicity in the request but still the answer was ""NO"".  I asked to speak with a manager and was told someone by the name of Michael McConnel would call back.  Two days go by and no call so I call again and leave another message for Michael but again didn't receive a return call.  Repeat this four times and to this day I've never received a return call in spite of being promised by every person who took a message that they would make sure he called me back.

I gave up and had the landscapers pick up the trees and get them planted.  The trees they brought to my house did not all appear to be the trees that we tagged.  the foreman did ask to switch a couple of the trees before leaving the nursery because he could see they were in poor shape and he was refused. 

So, the bottom line is POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  They have missed the opportunity for future business with me, my family and friends, and hopefully anyone reading this review.",2

My friends and I tried all the appetizers on the happy hour menu, since they are all only $5. I would recommend all of them (the watermelon  and goat cheese salad, crispy pork dumpling, oyster mushrooms and peppered chicken), the only one I wouldn't order again was the curried dumplings. They give you a pretty good portion for $5 so definitely hit up the happy hour. Also, they had $5 wine and cocktails.

When I went for dinner we ordered the crab toast with mango mustard and the pork belly tacos. Both of the entrees were very tasty. Our server recommended the crab toast and said it was one of this favorites, I liked it but I am not sure I would get it again -  I can't put my finger on why, but it just wasn't my favorite. The pork belly tacos on the other hand were awesome. The taco shell is actually the sweet, white, asian bread that you can get at dim sum and then inside is the pork belly. I thought there was a little too much bread for how much pork belly, but overall the favors were delicious. Then for desert we got the watermelon and goat cheese salad (my fav).

16167,2,1547510400000,"Inspired by Munich style beer halls, Wvrst opened mid last year in the Toronto King West area, serving up some exotic sausages and a wide variety of beers. I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and luckily I was able to find someone who was yet to have tried it.  Thanks for coming with me Justine H! In a nutshell, this place is like Oktoberfest, and now you can have it everyday at Wvrst!

Wvrst  definitely has flavours of a European sausage and beer hall, and really reminded me of Oktoberfest (except nicer). It's spacious and dimly lit with with ceiling strung lights --a casually comfortable place.

Wvrst Menu
Scattered around the hall tables were these long sheets of recycled paper which would be the menu. If you're looking for something other than fries, sausages, and alcohol, you're probably at the wrong place. The menu is simple, but the numerous options lie in the type of each you fancy.

At the back of the establishment there is a long open space that leads up to a rather small counter where you order and pay. I imagine this empty space is filled up by a line up during busier lunch hours. It wasn't too bad on the Tuesday night that we went.


Sausage Display Case
The display case is neatly organized with all the different sausages that they have. If you're in the mood for some exotic meats, then you're in luck. They have everything from kangaroo to venison, rabbit to guinea fowl. Justine H and I weren't too appetized looking at it, but after we managed to get over its appearance we went up to the counter to order.


Drinks
They have quite a number of beers here, bottled and on tap. Definitely not as many as a place like Beer Bistro might have, but more than just your commonly seen brews. Justine opted for the San Pellegrino Orange, and me an Austrailian beer Stiegl. Figured it was only fitting that I had a beer in the given setting!


Bratwvrst ($6) -Veal, Pork, and Wine
Duck ($9) -Maple and Fois Gras

These contemporary European sausages for the most part were quite good. Juicy and full of flavour. Didn't feel like I was eating a super artificial chunk of meat like I do having hot dogs from street vendors. In terms of flavour, I think it really depends on the sausage you order. You could definitely taste the fois gras in the Duck sausage, which was something Justine H didn't enjoy too much. I didn't mind it and found it to be an interesting combination, but I definitely liked the Bratwvrst more. I'd like to add that these sausages are quite small, and even with my small appetite I was unsatisfied having just the one hot dog.


Duck Fat Fries ($4.50)
Lots of other food enthusiasts raved about these fries, so we ordered a serving to share. Perhaps it was the heightened expectations from all the amazing reviews, but these duck fat fries fell just a bit short. They were full bodied, thick, and buttery, but they just weren't amazing. To be honest, I couldn't differentiate what difference the duck fat had on the fries compared to the ones made in regular oil. The order of fries comes with one dipping sauce, and the Wvrst Spicy we chose was great. Definitely not the best fries I've had, but they are quite tasty still, and would easily satisfy those random starchy fry cravings.


One last thing to note, is that they are big on leafs games here! They have a ticket giveaway at around 6:30pm the night of every Leaf's game at the Air Canada Center. With TV's all around the dining hall and tables that encourage conversation, it would be a great place to go catch the game along with a couple of drinks. But be warned, it might get pretty rowdy later in the night with cheering Leafs fans who've had a couple drinks or two!",2

Jerk chicken was the best I've ever eaten and ask for the hot sauce if you really want that extra kick. 

Definitely going back for the oxtail as well as the mac and cheese (when it's back)!",2
16170,2,1546387200000,"My previous pet sitter was found through a friend but was no longer available during the day. So I was nervous about finding someone new who could care for a houseful of pets -- 2 dogs, 3 cats, a bird and a salt-water reef tank with fish. My biggest concern was my senior German Shepherd (Gentle Ben) with spinal stenosis that has weakened a hind leg. He can't always wait until morning so he uses pee pads, and sometimes has fecal incontinence. (Too much information?) 

I found Melissa through Angie's List where she had glowing reviews. She was quick to reply to my email inquiry. After I gave her a lengthy description of my menagerie and the challenges with my German Shepherd's health issues, she assured me that she would be able to care for anything he needed.

When Melissa came over for the initial consultation, both my dogs immediately went up to her, wiggling and wagging their tails. (Usually they stand back a few feet with boisterous barking.) Their reception of her was enough to put my mind at ease. 

She brought papers to be filled out and told me that she was giving me a discount because Ben is a rescued pet. 

She visited 4 times a day for doggie potty breaks, meals & play time -- early morning, mid-day, dinner-time and late-night. 

While I was gone, she sent texts with pictures, giving me updates. I had left packets of capsules for each of Ben's meals. When she realized she would be short one packet, she sent a text with a picture of all the supplement bottles so I could easily tell her how much to give him of each one. 

Luckily, Ben used the pee pads and didn't have any other accidents inside the house! Even my shyest cat let her pet him! 

She did an amazing job caring for all of my pets, going above and beyond for Ben's needs. Now that I have Melissa for my pets, I can plan longer trips without worrying!",2

While working close by about 10 years ago, some co-workers suggested lunch at Crazy Jim's. I took my family a few times and they liked it too. We lived in Tempe, so it fell off our radar for awhile, but now it is back to regular visits and we've shared the secret with a few others...and we moved to SE Chandler and still go!

Baked feta is a great appetizer. I don't know what brand of feta they use, but it's creamy and fabulous. Their pita are just the best - I dream about their deliciousness. Soft on the inside, served warm with a toasty exterior. Yum! We often get the flaming cheese as well - a favorite with the kids.

16210,2,1547856000000,"Old Navy never seems to know what they're doing. Seems like every time I go in the store, this one in particular, they are in a perpetual state of entropic disorganization. You can never really find the alternative sizes for a shirt you like because they're all in mixed piles on tabletops. It's also as if they are constantly remodeling. In particular you can always be sure to find that the men's section has shrunk a little more each time you visit. I have never once come in here to find it perfectly organized.

That said, I can still award Old Navy 3 stars. While the clothes aren't top quality, they still manage to have a decent variety of menswear squeezed into what little bit of area remains. Lately I noticed they've got a lot of shirts that emphasize ""going outside"" and nature and such. It seems to be the trend these days, at least for me. Though that won't change my dislike for ""shirts with words on them"". And if you're in that boat with me, you will be delighted to find that ON has a great selection of both patterned and plain shirts to be had. This includes my personal favorite: heather. You know that sort of washed out/textured look that is added to make a single color shirt look more complex. I love that design and Old Navy has it on lock. Another personal favorite of mine here is the selection of work-out-wear for men. Lots of color, lots of visibility and reflectivity and actually a dash of style that is on the level of H&M for men's work out gear.

Be aware that their clothes all seem to run large and short and they absolutely do shrink in the dryer. Recently I've found that the necks in the shirts tend to stretch out a bit more than they used to. Seems that what little quality they had left is starting to go too.

16268,3,1548633600000,Disappointing! I believe the earlier reviews nailed it......cheap frozen food cooked without any type of sauce or spiffing up included. Bland and overpriced so you better come for the TVs. Our waitress was efficient and timely. I hope she is keeping her options open because I can't see this lasting in C-U.

16272,1,1546473600000,"In terms of lunch counter services, this place is one of my fallbacks for lunch, especially if I have a craving for Japanese-style Curry.

The storefront is nothing fancy, but it hits the all right boxes for Japanese curry  takeout lunches at my desk. 

Pricing wise - it is pretty reasonable - usually rings in around $12 after taxes. 

Service wise - it's pretty straightforward, I wouldn't say it is the friendliest service you would ever encounter, but they do the job without any extra production..

Foodwise - the portion is enough to be filling and I really like the pickled plums they enclose as a side dish to help clear the palate after finishing the meal.  The rice that is served with the curry can vary from time to time, sometimes nice and fluffy and sometimes a little too soggy for my taste. The curry is usually nice and savory with just a mild kick. I usually pick between either the chicken or pork katsu; both are pretty good. I find that the chicken is a little bit better, but you can't really go wrong with either. They have other dishes, but I usually just beeline it for the curry.",2

I can safely say that this location, albeit new and in a higher-income area, may the best McDonalds in Pittsburgh. I'm not sure if it's because its new, if the employees are paid more, or because they care more, but of the two times I've been here when craving McDonalds (which is usually when I'm hungover), the Cheeseburger's I've ordered look like they do on television, and taste great. No sloppy mess thrown together. The fries were hot, the burgers well-made and put together, and not horribly made by some 16 year old kid who doesn't care.

A few days later I called to confirm, because I had not seen the charge on my credit card and we hadn't received the dress. The dress just disappeared and that employee no longer worked there.

The server appeared promptly (maybe a little too much so) to take our drink orders, so we put him off just a bit while we perused the wine and beer selections, which were pretty good.

When we placed our dinner orders I let the waiter know that we had a 7:30 show, no big hurry at that time, but better safe than sorry.

I had the Fried Chicken that has gotten so many good reviews, Mac and Cheese, cabbage and mashed potatoes.  My dear Sweet Wife went with the Fried Flounder Filet, Collards, Mac and Cheese and mashed potatoes.

OK, here's where I'm supposed to complain how everything fell apart, we were late for our show, and I died from undercooked chicken.....but none of that happened.

Our meal arrived promptly, but not so fast that we did not have time to enjoy our drinks a little before eating.  The chicken was delicious, juicy and flavorful with a nice crust.  Try as I may, I can't seem to cook chicken, so I appreciate it when someone gets it right.  The cabbage had good flavor, not watery, as you get at many restaurants.  The mac and cheese?  Well, it rivaled my Wife's (sorry Babe), and she makes really good and unhealthy mac and cheese with lots of cheese and cream.  Mashed Potatoes?  Biscuits?  Done right.

The flounder was breaded with the same sort of crust as the chicken instead of a corn meal breading.  She said it was very good.  A big portion of collards were well done.

We passed on dessert because the main portions were plenty.  

All in all, we had a good experience.  We had plenty of time, but we weren't rushed by the staff. Of course Monday at 6:00 is not a busy time, but by the time we left several parties had arrived and the place was pretty busy.",2

Total Bill: $35 lunch; $55 dinner

Level of Satisfaction: High Mediocre

Quick Tips:
  - Do not eat here for dinner.  Portions are the same as lunch and cost nearly twice as much.
  - We never get personal or really good service here.  Just mediocre.

We are ratings Gogi 3 stars but we want to elaborate.  If we were just rating the food, they get a 5 stars hands down.  The food is so good and the only thing we have had but didn't enjoy was the fish katsu.  It had way too many bones to truly enjoy.  But the bibimbap, the bulgogi, and galbi all will make your mouth water just to write about.  Yes, I'm salivating now!

The service however.  Not so great.  Seems like you need to be a ""friend of the family"" to get really good service.  We almost feel not welcome walking in.

The second complaints is the difference between dinner and lunch prices.  After originally going for a lunch and then returning for another visit at dinner time, we clearly noticed the huge bill and lack of larger portions.

Coincidentally, it happened to be the featured item on the menu.  All other options were wet-aged, which I'm not a huge fan of.  Wine selection is somewhat limited.  Sides were what you can expect from a joint like this.  The four stars is mainly for the quality of beef and perfectly grilled to order.  This is a convenient spot for a nice dinner if you're staying in the hotel.  Availability shouldn't be a problem since it's nearly always empty.

Food was excellent, well priced and portioned very well. Service was pure perfection, decor was immaculate and lack of music and television of any kind only increased the entire meal. 

The burger was cooked wonderfully, the fries were reminiscent of the food truck fare (my favourite type) and the duck buns, which I did not give much credit to - seeing that this restaurant is a self touted tavern - were quite possibly the best stater we had. 

I also had an old fashioned, which most places will either completely mess up with the wrong ice or poor taste profile. This came in a glass that was pre-frozen 3/4 full of ice and drink on top. Definitely the most inventive solution to this drink I've ever seen.

16428,1,1548720000000,"If Hakkasan the nightclub is anything like Hakkasan the Restaurant I'll probably wait to head back. There is one very common ingredient that seperates a $10-15 entree from a $30+ one - and it has nothing to do with food. That ingredient is service. I can find a $15 steak around Las Vegas almost as easily as I can find $1 bud lights. The reason I occasionally pay $40 for a steak is because the service I get at the $40 joint vs. the $10 dive is better. The wait staff is more attentive, the ambiance is nicer, it's just a fancier experience start to finish. With all of that said, while Hakkasan does have some good grub, their service is not up to par with the other high end Strip restaurants. They are probably 4-5 stars on food and 2 stars on service, for this one I'm rounding down.

Our waitress wasn't awful, but when the dining fare is $65 a head (our bill was $130 for 2) I expect my glass to remain full, the table to remain clean, and the waitress to remain present. That wasn't a regular occurance on my latest visit to Hakkasan. The food itself was pretty solid. The Roasted Chilean Sea Bass is definitely my favorite item on the menue. Sweet and flaky, this fish is not fishy at all and is cooked to perfection. We began our meal with the steamed dumplings. Very good, you get 2 of the same flavor and four different flavors. 3 of the 4 included shrimp, the other had duck - all of them were tasty. In addition to the Sea Bass we went with a Pork Belly dish. Not sure what I was expecting, but I didn't love this. Way too fatty of a piece of meat for me, though when I did get a bite of actual pork that was very good. The sticky buns that came with the dish were also really good. Our waitress had a chronic case of RBF (urban dictionary that - you're welcome). Not her fault (I don't think), but it didn't help the cause.

For $135 there is better service and better food on the Las Vegas Strip. I can't say I'd go out of my way to dine here again, nor would I want to sway someone from trying Hakkasan. It's good, just don't set your expectations too high from a service standpoint.",2

I bet $250 on Player.  Player was dealt a 6 & 2 which is a natural winner.  Banker had 2 other lower cards.  But the terminal wouldn't pay me.  I called up to the dealer and he got a supervisor.  I then requested the casino manager come over before they cleared the screen.

The manager said there was a malfunction on all of the 15 or so terminals and Player didn't win because some how there were 6 total cards dealt in a completely different order and Banker won. . . I can't figure out how that could happen unless the computer system is RIGGED!!!!!!!!!

I called The Gaming Commission and their representative came out.  He said it says right at the top of the machine in VERY TINY PRINT:  All malfunctions void play and pay.  Therefore they were not going to pay my winning Player bet, but instead they would just steal $500 from me.

I would point out that it says 'malfunctions void play' therefore they should have at least given me back my $250 bet. . . but of course, they didn't!!!!!!!!

COMMUNAL SEATING, EVENTS & OKTOBERFEST
I had eaten there w/ friends and really enjoyed the vibe with their hip, casual, picnic table communal tables, so I had tried to book an event there.  Sadly, due to a relative passing I had to cancel the event.  I can't commend their manager, Bram, enough;  He was willing to work with me far more than any of the dozen other places I explored.  After asking his advice for my budget, he guided me towards non-October dates so I could get a better rate; naturally, they are hopping for Oktoberfest all month, so it's a bit harder to book the entire place during peak hours that month.  Look forward to checking out their Oktoberfest in the future!

They will let you book a section of the open concept space or rent the entire space for a fixed minimum food/beverage fee that is pretty reasonable.  

DESSERT
Though they don't really offer much in the way of desserts, they had plans to start working w/ a neighbour bakery to expand offerings for the regular menu & for events.

FOOD
Their menu is pretty much traditional all the way to exotic sausages on buns or as curry wvrst -- sliced without a bun w/ a curry ketchup like is super popular in Germany.  

DRINK
They have a wide range of not-your-average-joe domestic and import beers and YES really good wine options, too.  Bartenders seem to know their stuff and are enthusiastic and can accurately describe various beverages (very pleasant surprise these days for fairly casual fare).

SERVICE
We looked at their deli case to select sausages and purchase them at the counter.  Then, food was brought to our table.  We bellied up to the bar to buy our drinks separately then carried them back to our table, though, I think you can also buy it when you get your food. 

PARKING
Sort of crowded street parking that I recall, so I recommend walking, biking, or street car.

PAYMENT
Where else can you buy a sausage and pay for it w/ credit card?  Not likely when getting street meat from a stand.",2

16573,2,1547856000000,"My boyfriend and I used to come here from time to time since it was open late and I often crave thai food. The last experience we had would keep us from ever going back. 

A few weeks back, my boyfriend and I went to have a late night dinner and a drink. Upon arrival, we waited for a table to be cleaned so that we could be seated. It wasn't at all that busy but the servers were really slow. Once we were seated, we noticed a table beside us that was still waiting to be cleaned, and probably a few others as well. Make a side note of that. 

Anyway, we picked our drinks and food and awaited a waiter. We finally snagged one and asked if we could order our drinks. They had told us that someone would be able to get to us shortly. Waiting patiently, a waiter finally came by and took our order. We then waited for about a good 10-15 mins for our drinks until we asked the waiter where they were. He said he would check. Drinks finally came and I didn't particularly like them so I gave them both to my boyfriend. As he was drinking it I noticed something floating in the drink. I then grabbed my phone to use as a flashlight to see what was it was. THERE WERE 3-4 BUGS IN THE DRINK. Still kicking and moving around. DISGUSTING. The fact that we had taken a few sips from the drink itself completely appalled me. We returned BOTH the drinks and asked for a manager. The manager, who had actually made and delivered the drinks, had tried to convince us that they were seeds probably. Uhm, seeds don't have legs and there aren't seeds in the drinks that we ordered. 

The manager was very apologetic and paid for one of our meals. Still unforgiving, we wrote a little note on the receipt, didn't tip, and left knowing we would never come back. Oh, and that table beside us that was never cleaned... Never got cleaned up the entire time we were there.",2

The tempura is hit and miss (shrimp and yams = yum, squid and mixed veggies = blah) and the wok/korean items are food court calibre. The Sake is pricey, even an average Hakutsuru draft. There's not a ton of variety of Sushi per se, although the dinner menu ups the ante a little bit. 

Yet, I LOVE this place.

How do I explain this? It's that magic combination of $15 lunch/$25 dinner AYCE Sushi, a clean bright and nicely renovated space, casually asian vibe (clean bandit and PSY not worn out tape of ersatz flute and harp music) and attentive but not hanging-off-you-for-a-tip servers -- there are few things I hate worse than an AYCE place with staff trained to hard-upsell you on beverages.

And iPads. 

Yes, iPads. As silly gimmicks go, I am a sucker for ordering things when I can see pretty pictures of them. And when it comes to AYCE I like to make sure my eyes aren't bigger than my stomach before I order. I love tapping the iPad to see which items I've ordered so far.

We arrived about an hour early to set up and drop off supplies but quickly found that it wasn't necessary to arrive so early. A staff member (Mercedes) quickly jumped in to help us unload the car and situate the party room. At 5pm, the other guests left as Kangamoo closed and the staff helped us set up a table in the main area for the food. Immediately we put out the veggie and fruit trays and the drinks for the kids. 

As the guests started arriving, Kangamoo staff members greeted them and helped get them signed in. The staff also took the presents and arranged them neatly on a side table (just one more thing not to have to worry about). One of the best things about this birthday party from a parent's perspective is that I didn't have to worry about guiding and dictating a schedule. The kids played in the play area for the first hour while the adults mingled in the front. Some were enjoying the massage chairs, others were painting their nails with their daughters. 

About 15 minutes into the festivities, Moana came in. This Moana was a spot-on character and knew every line from the movie. Instantly the kids were enthralled with her. They played games and Moana led them on adventures in the play area for about an hour. She sang songs and danced with the kids and before she left, she sang happy birthday to the birthday girl and signed a personalized autograph to each child in attendance. Kangamoo arranged for Moana to be there as part of the package so we didn't have to worry about scheduling. 

We provided pizzas before the cake and the staff helped arrange the food service. With the openness of the playground, there was plenty of room for us to eat and relax up front while the kids had fun. After things were winding down, the staff helped us graciously pass out gift bags to the kids leaving and then load up our car with all the left overs and presents. We didn't have to worry about cleaning up and were able to get our girls home right on time. They were so tired from playing, that they passed out early which gave us some much-needed adult time this evening. Thank you, Mimi, Shawn and the entire Kangamoo staff for the best birthday party ever.",2
16653,3,1547856000000,"Full disclosure:  I love Tessaro's, they make a mean, mean burger, so when a friend suggested we go to Burgatory, I thought I would be disappointed.

I was not!  We ended up going late in the afternoon on Christmas Eve.  Despite the fact that the Steelers were playing, the place was only one-third full so we got in right away.

While the menu burgers all sounded great, I decided to do the ""meat your maker"".  I had the black peppercorn rub on ground sirloin topped with field greens, tomato, red onion, and cheddar with their homemade mayo.  You can choose three ""doneness"":  bloody, pink, and none.  I'm a medium-well girl so I just noted that on the little card you use when you create your own burger (since I didn't know if that fit into pink or none category).

The burger for me was done perfectly:  just enough pink in the middle and mega juicy.  The bun was freshly made and since they buttered it and then grilled it on the flatiron, it was similar to texas toast (yum).  The rub was a good complement to the meat, and the toppings were fresh and wonderful.

The burgers come with homemade chips, a mix of russet and sweet potato.  At first, I thought I'd spring for fries, but honestly the chips are really, really good:  lightly seasoned with a bit of pepper and sea salt and went well with the burger.

Service was prompt and efficient and she did a great job explaining the menu and all of the variations/options.  For what you get and the quality of the ingredients, the meal is quite affordable.

I (as it turned out wisely) thought that a milkshake and a burger would be too much.  I think the next time I go I'll split a milkshake with someone to have with my meal.  They all looked fantastic.

How does this compare to Tessaro's?  The burgers at Tessaro's are a tad bigger (maybe by a healthy ounce) and while the meat quality is similar.  You can taste the smokiness from Tessaro's wood fired grill.  However, Tessaro's does not use a rub, so you get a different flavor from a Burgatory burger which is a different taste, but to my pallet, just as good.  Tessaro's home fries edged out Burgatory's side of chips.  So the verdict for me is that Tessaro's is just a hair better--but Burgatory is also very, very good.",2

16658,3,1547856000000,"Came here for dinner and were very impressed.  First of all, everyone we asked recommended this place, so let me add my part by saying this, 'highly recommend this place'.  It does get busy at night but the place still retains its coziness and trendiness.  Now that you're here, remember, stetson salad!  No really, it's a must!
Besides the salad, we had the duck and flat iron steak, both were delicious and tingled our taste buds in different ways.
Our waiter was excellent, very efficient, never forgot about us, would check up on us at exactly the right times, tossed out salad, brought out the dishes in exactly the right order (unlike some places that just bring them out as they come, or worse, and then you end up with your appetizer after you're done with your steak...)

16667,1,1548201600000,"I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could.

The space is gorgeous and the ambiance is great. Beautiful low light, nice tall ceilings and clean understated decor but the space is incredibly loud. Once about half of the tables cleared out I was finally able to hear people talking at my table. 

Dinner was decent but nothing really amazing. We had an ok paella, some decent potatoes. The olives were not great (I'd skip those for sure next time) but the bread was delicious. 

Dessert was the highlight. We split the churros, the basque cake and the fried milk. All were extremely well done. I only wish that the meal had been as good.  

Service was efficient, if not a little cold (though I prefer that to overly smiley servers who make off jokes and bad small talk). 

One big pet peeve was that the hostess didn't look up from her iPad when we walked in and didn't know that our table had already arrived when we got there. She just told us that there was no reservation under the name we told her. If they hadn't seen us from across the restaurant we might have left. Then we stood there awkwardly holding our coats in front of the coat rack for a few minutes until we finally flagged someone down. Not the best first impression - someone should greet you smiling, know that your reservation has already arrived and ask to take your coat right away. 

if friends were going for dinner I'd join them but probably wouldn't go back on my own. That said, I would go back in a heartbeat just for dessert.",1

16681,1,1548288000000,"Delicioussss!!!
Significant other and I started off with the scallops, a chard and a Pinot grigio, the waiter was Absolutely wonderful. Then we moved on to the ribeye entreé. 16 oz. of medium steak oh my goodness just scrumptious, my bf preferred slightly medium well and myself medium rare and surprisingly the steak was prepared so! The waiter really listened to our preferences, it was quite astounding. Anyway, we paired that with a Pinot noir which was the grotto's wine buyer's choice of the red that would pair with the steak. It was quite well matched.
For dessert, we chose the mocha chocolate mousse which was great with their reisling, it really cleaned the palate after the steak and finished the dinner with 5 stars. I highly recommend this restaurant, particularly for people who are wine connoisseurs or completely new to wine, the waiter, Fred, was entirely Helpful and really pleasant throughout. =) Enjoy!",2
16684,3,1547164800000,"Average is the word to describe Rock Bottom brewery. Service is good, staff is friendly, but the food is mediocre at best. 

Our most recent visit to Rock Bottom brewery was on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was not very busy. We were seated immediately and waited on immediately. 

My husband ordered a $4 flight of drinks on special. He enjoyed each one, especially the Wintercrush, which was suggested by the server. I really liked the Irish Pearl, which is a dark dry Irish stout. It had notes of smoke, wood, and coffee, which I really enjoyed. 

For my meal I ordered the ribeye, medium. It was cooked slightly medium-well around the edges of the steak. There was very basic seasoning on it, so it was just a steak. Nothing special, no seasoning that stood out. I added shrimp to my steak for $3.99. The shrimp were a severe disappointment. They were extra small shrimp, and they lacked any seasoning. They were also overcooked, so they were curled up into tight little balls. 

As for my sides I ordered the green beans (seasonal vegetable), and the apple coleslaw. The green beans were also bland. No seasoning on them at all. They could have used a little garlic or onion or something. The Apple slaw was average as well - it was a standard mayo based slaw, with a few pieces of Apple here and there. I feel like more vinegar would have brightened it up and allowed the Apple to come through more in the dish. If I had to give this meal a letter grade, I would give it a C. 

My husband ordered the fish and chips, with a side of Apple slaw. The fish was tasty, moist and cooked well. The Cajun remoulade was really good, and added a nice touch to the meal. The fries (chips) were standard fries seasoned with a Cajun season salt. I'd say his meal was better because it was better seasoned. 

All in all we had a good experience, but the food wasn't anything to get excited over. I would probably return for the pub-food and drink specials, but wouldn't come back if I were in the mood for steak.",2
16685,3,1547251200000,"Did not stay here just played here and at first it was great but at about nine pm they cranked the air conditioner to what felt like 60 no joke, so sorry flamingo I will not be staying the night or mostly likely playing in your casino because I was so incredibly uncomfortable.",3

Do not buy the drinks there, however! The orange juice had settled so much it looked like apple juice with a bright orange ring at the bottom. To be safe, my partner ordered a fruit punch. It looked fine from the outside but when he got to the bottom...lots of red flakes. It was gross. 

Otherwise, great for takeout to bring home and eat with your own beverages! They have great hours but are closed on Sundays, which is unfortunate!

16695,3,1548288000000,"This is probably my least favorite Harkins to go catch a movie - aside from the one at Metro!

You get dropped off by mom to sit in front of a movie theatre and do what, check out other 14 year olds walk by? Having a full jr high school inside the theatre makes for a very unpleasant movie experience. I can't tell you how many times I've had to ""shh"" a kid next to me or asked them take their phone/text conversations outside. 1/5 times the kids in there are just texting back and forth or making out in the theatre the whole time while their other friends are giggling and throwing popcorn at the lovebirds.

16696,1,1547769600000,"2 stars for the wings - 1 star for the bland buffalo sauce, and +1 for the nice jumbo-sized wings. 

I made sure they made their own buffalo sauce instead of just use Frank's or something. They did make their own. And uh... it wasn't great. Smelled really strongly of vinegar when it came out, but unfortunately it was SO mild.  No tang, no spice, and lacking in plain old salt.

I'll be nice and +1 star for the ephemere cherry I had. I'm not a big beer person, but my friend said i might like it, and it was probably my favorite beer I've tried ever. Straight up fruity with a very refreshing finish. It's probably not for everyone, but it was for me. 

Interesting selection of rareish beer(s) might make me come back. The decor and vibe is a bit generic, but it's fine. However, shitty wing sauce with my beer is a definitely big strike in my book :/",1

Upon the waiters recommendation, we ordered the fried spring roll appetizer.
No surprises here, just a good simple spring roll. 

I had the Seafood Noodle soup. It was really tasty!!! Normally I am piling chili peppers, and spicy stuff in it to pop the flavor. I am glad I tasted it first, after adding a few bean sprouts, some shredded basil and a couple jalapeño slices it was PERFECT! Really perfect!

16711,1,1547078400000,"This place is so douchey it's unbelievable...but I keep saying to myself about everything from this trip ""It's Vegas, what else do you expect?!"" 

Vegas is like one big magnet for Tap Out and Affliction shirts, tramp stamps, lucite heels...you name it, you find it here! But, that's another story. (Excuse me, where can I write a review for the whole city of Las Vegas?!) 

Would never frequent this type of joint at home, but ""what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" so I figured I'd stop in for the Vanilla Ice concert while we were here. Yes, I'll admit proudly, I'm a child of the 90's! 

The promoter who gave us free wristbands and escorted us to the front of the line was awesome, but the door staff that work for the venue were total jerks on a power trip. They didn't want to speak with anyone, make eye contact, or be of any help what-so-ever. 

Hey, we're a group of fine lookin' ladies dressed to the nines, here to party and spend some cash on over priced drinks. Why do you keep letting in the old fogies and under dressed? 

Finally, after about 5-10 minutes, I caught the eye of a guy ogling my lady lumps and told him we were ready to go in. Thankfully, he obliged without saying a single word. Silence is golden, especially when he's lifting the velvet rope. 

The last girl in with our group claims her Kim Kardashian was grabbed on the way in, by whom, we don't know...but I've got my eyes on the slick haired Napoleon behind the computer. 

In short, the venue is tiny, the bar is overrun and the drinks of course... are overpriced. SHOCKER! They were charging $10 for something slightly larger than a Dixie cup of Champagne, from a bottle of Andre which is about $4.99 a bottle at any local convenience station. 

By the end of the night we were on a first name basis with the staff inside (yeah, we're just a bunch of midwest gals at heart) and were asked to come back again on Sunday night, but passed....there is only so much Rok one can handle in a lifetime; and I'm pretty sure I've met my limit.",2

16721,3,1546300800000,"Oh Kaya. What a love/hate relationship I have with you. There are some truly great things on your menu. But the service . . . 

As one of the few places open in the Strip District after 5 pm I usually come here at least once a month if not more. As I am usually by myself I sit at the always-packed bar. And that's where the problems start. One bartender for a bar with around 20 stools that spans nearly the length of the restaurant? I don't know how they do it. During the evening hours, this is just not enough. Especially as they're serving food and fancy drinks. 

Management - Please try adding a bartender at happy hour to say 9 pm. The food runners NEVER remember your whole order. I don't get silverware until I ask for it. I don't get my aioli that's supposed to come with the dish until I ask for it. And the runners always look confused or put out with my simple requests. The bartenders are supposed to be providing these things but when do they have the time? Also - why does the food always end up on a metal prison tray with paper that ends up sticking to the food? It makes cutting impossible. Try plates. Really. They work. I know you're going for the rustic look but it's just not practical. 

Now I know what you're thinking. You're sitting at the bar ya dumb bunny. You can't expect table-level service. Oh yes, I can. Single people are making up more and more of the dining population. Expectations on the part of the restaurants need to be adjusted. And I have eaten at the tables in a group. The service was still not great. Lots of socializing between servers and not much hustle. And still, the resentful looks when you ask for things like cutlery and water. Now that's just silly.

If you're going to Kaya be sure to check out the Fried Chicken Thursdays. I wish they would do away with the incompatible sides like tortillas(?) and do a take on island soul food. Also the conch fritters would go really well with the chicken. Oh gawd. The conch fritters are so good. Crunchy on the outside and almost creamy on the inside. And the spicy mayo (aioli) is insanely good. You'll want to use it on everything. I love the Poke bowl as well although I usually order it without all the fruit. I prefer a simpler version. Pro Tip - The side dishes and appetizers overall seem to be much more interesting and just plain better than main entrees. The cocktails could be a lot better as I have ordered many different kinds and haven't found a stand-out. The liquor choices could be expanded as well. 

But whatever you do Kaya please don't lose the conch fritters.",2
16723,3,1547683200000,"I Loooooooove me some Edgar! 

My innocent stroll through the Venetian shops before dinner somehow turned into me walking out of S.Y.L.K. with bags full of clothing and accessories!

It certainly helped that the store had a big sign that said that there was a Memorial Day sale - 50% off!!.  The store is bright, so all the clothing does seem to pop out.  It was also refreshing to see a store in the Venetian where you could purchase fashionable and affordable clothing.  If you are in your 20s, this is a perfect place to visit if you want some edgy, fashion forward pieces.

If it wasn't for Edgar, I don't think us 3 girls would have stayed in the store for that long or purchased as many items as we did.  He saw that I was already holding some clothing and immediately got me started on a fitting room.  Every single time I would grab another item, he would immediately take it and place it in the fitting room.  Not only that, but he would suggest pieces that I should try that would compliment my figure and placed those in the fitting room for me to try as well.  When it came time to try on all the clothes we selected, I was so pleased to find that all of the pieces were laid out so beautifully in the dressing room for me! 

I appreciated his honesty, enthusiasm, and his ability to make me and my girlfriends laugh throughout our shopping experience at S.Y.L.K.

16750,2,1547683200000,"During a trip up to the Charlotte area, stopped into Rocky River Vineyards. Enjoyed a Tasting, a Wine Slushy, and a bottle of Chambourcin in the gorgeous environment.

Quality
Since grapes are unable to grow in the South Florida climate, it requires trips to other states to visit wineries that don't just use an assortment of tropical fruits. And while North Carolina may not be the capital of wine production, they do have their own varieties of grapes and a few wineries where you can check them out. On a recent visit to the Charlotte area, we made a detour out to Rocky River Vineyards. We experienced a Tasting of ten wines and slushies including two made with Carlos Muscadine and Noble Muscadine grapes grown on site. And while I found the vast majority of wines a little sweet for my taste, it was still a fun experience. We also selected a bottle of our favorite their Chambourcin and enjoyed it on an outdoor patio. The full bodied red wine was solid, though a lighter wine may have been more appropriate for the warm day. We also decided to get a small glass of the Blackberry Pomegranate Wine Slushy, which was the popular choice among other guests of the winery. The slushy was the highlight of the visit for me.

Quantity
The Tasting was very fair and provided a good sampling of ten different wines. Depending on your mood they also have a Wine Slushy that will meet your expectations no matter what size you want, just beware of a brain freeze.

Value
Knowing that we were going to visit I did a little research and purchased a Groupon ahead of time, which came with two tastings, two glasses to bring home, and a bottle for just $17. At nearly half the normal price it is a great deal. However, the normal prices are not bad either in case you want to splurge on some extras.

Ambiance
Rocky River Vineyards is located east of Charlotte in an area called Midland. It is off the beaten path and caused great confusion for our Uber drivers. To enter you follow a stone path that takes you up a hill and through some trees. At the top you are met with a gorgeous site, rows and rows of grapes decorating rolling hills. A small house is located on the property and contains the store and bar where you conduct the tasting. It is air conditioned, providing some relief on a warm day. They have a little patio outside the house and then a large covered deck with open walls overlooking the grapes. We selected a table in this area to enjoy our wine before walking down to the grapes. This area is clearly set up for large events like weddings, with a bar, tables, and lots of seating. My only issue was the large number of bugs and flies on the humid day. I would advise bringing some bug spray if you plan to hang out for a longer period of time.

Crowd
There was a good crowd of people visiting the winery. Some mentioned that they were doing a tour of wineries in the area, others admitted they were in the mood for wine slushies, and a few appeared to be checking out the venue for a possible event. The one common bond however was everyone had a Groupon. It is a beautiful location and though I was not crazy about the wine, it is a great escape for a romantic afternoon.

Service
There were two ladies working at the bar during our visit. They provided a very informative tasting and were extremely knowledgable about the wine grown in the area. North Carolina is not usually an area I think of when talking about wines, so the detailed descriptions were very helpful.

Parking
During our visit we relied on car service companies, and that was a challenge at Rocky River Vineyards. There were not a lot of cars in the area, so the prices really mounted for this ride. If you are driving, things are much simpler as they have a private parking lot.

Extra
Rocky River Vineyards may not have wowed with its wines, but I did not really expect it to. It did however provide a wonderful tasting experience with some lovely staff in a beautiful setting. Absolutely worthy of a visit, just keep your wine snob attitudes behind.",2

In the past the employees have been unhelpful and rude but these days there has been a change in the wind. The store supervisor or manager Matt, has the ball rolling for a great customer service experience. He is friendly, hard-working, and always willing to go the extra mile for his customers with a smile. He has helped me numerous times checking me out and putting back items I decided not to get. What a great associate! Thank you.",2

I found a color I think is going to be right and inquired as to get a sample can before I had to go to a full gallon.  It wasn't possible, which seemed odd,  but it had been a long day and I just left.  

Today I went in to get an extra sample card and found, Patrick, who seemed to really understand  what I really am trying to do.  I also found out that sample ""quarts"" are available and I went home happily with one.  If you do in, I would recommend, Patrick, he sure helped me!",2

Just go. Get your parking validated! Plan sufficient time!

CUSTOMER SERVICE
Buuuut I am a wordy nerd. And I have to give really give props to the customer service here. We showed up on a Thursday for lunch and had the fortune of sitting in Robert G's section. Showing an excitement level I don't think I've seen in a server *ever* he walked us through the delightfully robust menu. My taste buds salivated at the many options. Robert G. got more worked up as I ordered my porter beer. (They stock an excellent porter on draft! Deschutes Black Butte). When someone shows that much passion for their work it rubs off on everyone. 

OYSTERS | GET'EM!
Based on Robert's elocution and delivery we, of course (!), had to sample some Boston oysters from Cape Cod. Oysters come with many accoutrement options beyond cocktail sauce and horseradish. We were sold on the jalapeño mignonette. It's this green, spicy heavenly goodness. The vinaigrette comes consists of cilantro, cucumber, shallot, jalapeño + red wine vinegar + v.oil.

I'm sighing thinking back to how delightful an experience it was slurping my little raw guys down. I'm from the east coast. This Phoenix locale delivers raw oysters superbly. Had I not already placed a food order I could have contently eaten oysters the rest of the afternoon. (I'll come back and do just that.) GOOD STUFF.

ENTREES | MM MMM!
My friend and I ordered at the polar opposites of the palate menu. I went for something spicy (Jamalaya). She did something rather sweet (Pork Carnitas). Both were excellent. I'd enjoy either in a heart beat again. Warning: the portions are ginormous! When they say spicy, they mean spicy. The Jamalaya is just that! Generous servings of sausage, chicken and shrimp are provided. 

MISC
The bar is super! It's a central feature of the restaurant. Plenty of seats for everyone. Comfortable for anyone to dine solo. And (!) a number of televisions up high were showing work related content. (I imagine that changes depending on the hour.) I just really liked how unobtrusive they were.

On our way out we noticed there were booths in the interior area of the restaurant. Something to consider checking out. The outdoor patio looks fab!

Love, love, love!

LOVE!",2

What a great team. And such a huge help that you can get massage,chiropractic care,physical therapy and more all at the same place. Pain is never fun to deal with but, having such wonderful people to help relieve the pain is awesome! Huge personal thank you to Dr.Zitnik and James. Best chiropractic and pt ever!",2
16787,2,1547424000000,"I didn't pick this place.  The Girlfriend's Aunt picked this place.  She picked it because there was a good coupon in the paper for the kinds of foods she likes - seafood, southern food, bit of Cajun influence. As this was her birthday dinner - we didn't argue.  Even after looking at their web site.  Oh, what you'll do for family...

The parking lot was packed, but the restaurant had only about 5 tables occupied on this Saturday night at 7pm.  I meant to check out the bar as it must be the slamin' Mesa hot spot based on all those cars.  The Aunt tells me that they were having all you can eat ribs in there from what she heard.  

We walk in and immediately the 4 of us under the age of 50 start either giggling or staring in open mouthed wonder. To your immediate left - case of lovely knives for sale.  Forward and to your right - some inspirational cards.  A few more steps and there are stuffed animals galore for your viewing and purchasing pleasure.  To your left as you keep walking are some lovely sparkly mini-purses. View straight ahead and you'll see a shelved display of fairy figurines for sale.  (Not until we were walking out did we see the hand painted Jesus or the hand painted Pope John Paul with Mother Theresa figurine. At only $45 bucks it was quite the bargain.)  We were tempted to run until we heard The Aunt say, ""Oh, this is nice"".  Reminder - why we are here...

The hostess takes us into the room of our dreams - the one we'd seen on line and actually wanted to sit in for the pure giggle factor.  They have a giant tree in the center of the room.  Yes, ...yes they do. (See the picture to check it out in all it's glory.) You can sit under the tree's silk leaves and flowers - and even the bird house.   We were led to the table in the corner with its own white weave walls.  And a gigantic fish on the wall right above The Aunt's head.  We couldn't have asked for more. 

The menu is varied.  There is a wide variety. Their special that night actually inspired her to not use her coupon - Lobster tail, King crab leg and fried shrimp (with a soup or salad, baked potato and veggie) for just $16.  Who isn't impressed at that price?  I got one of their other specials - Fillet Mignon with shrimp (bacon wrapped, stuffed, fried, or scampi) with all the fixins for just $12. How can you screw that up too badly, right?   Someone else branched out to try their frog legs with red beans and rice.  None of us were waiting to be impressed, but we were just curious.

During our 20 minute wait for salads and our most likely total 45 minute wait (ordering to plate) time for dinner we did a great job of keeping each other entertained.  We're a bit of a lively group.  We aren't shocked to be louder than your average table as our group of 5 is filled with loud laughers and generally funny folks.  In this place though - it was shocking. No background music.  No background noise.  In a not too large room we hardly heard anyone else talking.  Another waitress (whom we wish we'd had as she was a hoot, and actually stopped by several times to tell us a joke or comment about the good time we were having) joked about how we'd gotten far too quiet (as one does when telling dirty jokes in Mesa) and she was relying on us to put some sound in the place.  

And finally to the food.  It wasn't good.  It wasn't awful.  My medium well fillet was super dry well and only about 1/2 to 3/4 an inch thick.  A chewy hockey puck.  The bacon wrapped shrimp weren't awful - but were far over cooked and dry.  I was told the frog's legs weren't bad at all.  The red beans and rice had only a theory of spice - but they are most likely well suited to the older Mesa crowd. The Aunt loved her food.  This means nothing to most of you - but The Aunt has been in Arizona for a year, and we've taken her to many great spots and they've done nothing for her.  This is the first one that she's really, really liked.  Really.

Service wasn't great.  Wasn't awful, but we really got the slow server.  One nice thing - for just $3 they brought out a individual sized cake (about 4 inch round) all frosted up nicely with a candle and we all sang Happy Birthday.  They weren't super slick about it so she knew something was going down, and the cake had obviously been made long ago and defrosted (cracks in the side) - but it looked nice to her and that's all that mattered.

If you have high culinary sensibilities - drive on by.  It's not your kind of place.  If you're looking for a cheap seafood alternative without too much focus on quality - it isn't too bad.  If you're looking for a great spot to take pictures for your MySpace profile - it's totally worth it.

2.3 stars from me.  But I'm letting The Aunt's interest bump it to a 3 star review.  (Happy Birthday!)",3
16789,3,1547251200000,"I was pretty excited to try Beckett's and I have been back 4 times in 2 months so I consider myself a devoted fan. They did an excellent job of remodeling the old place (whose name we shall not mention). And no matter how busy they are I have never had a wait for a table. 


Here's the breakdown of what I have tried:

Grilled cheese with pancetta and roasted red pepper tomato soup - 3 stars

Rock shrimp, corn and butternut squash enchiladas in a guajillo sauce - 3 stars

Short ribs, mashed potatoes, green beans, red wine reduction - 4 star (when they say fork tender they mean it and the reduction is amazing)

Brussels sprouts, pancetta and manchego, in a lemon thyme vinaigrette - 5 Gazillion Stars, best I've had in a restaurant.

And to top it all off (Damn you Georgie S.)
chocolate dipped bacon s'mores - They come on a plate with  caramel, marshmallow creme,  peanut butter, and a graham cracker- 4 stars

Featured Cocktails are video game and comic book based (and they can make anything else you want).

For the record I am a huge Pete's fan.

I dropped in Friday night.  I ordered shrimp and fries and hush puppies.  Their system of walk up order then get in a second line was confusing people.  Add into that mix the woman actually running the register and handling the cash was probably tweaking her balls off.  Or she was an ex tweaker that forgot how to act normal or she was just nuts.

She was openly talking shit to the guy ordering in front of me when he had something to say about her register skills.  Any way surreal experience to say the least.

Down to the food.  Oh I ate that greasy ass shit.  I ate the fuck out of it.  But it was all pre-packaged frozen shrimp and fries and the same for the hush puppies, over cooked balls of hard crust.

So shame on you JR's.  The place had some people in it too.  I wont be back unless the start advertising fresh seafood.",2

We were picked up at our hotel and taken to the range. We had Paul as our instructor and he was great. Took time explaining the MP5 and how to shoot this. We were both experienced pistol and trap shooters but learning to lean into our front foot and  then pull the trigger was something new. No recoil on the MP5, 9mm shells so not much to use but still no kick. The van driver was great as was Julia at the desk. We would go back again since they have dedicated lanes for gun owners. Next time we will do the AR50 (3 round for $50) but this is the same gun used in Shooter. 50 cal monster. Not even legal to be shot in CA.",3
16828,1,1547683200000,"I like this place a lot. It's already hard enough to find a pool hall in the suburbs let along one that's not a complete dive. There are loads of snooker tables... I don't know how to play but I think I'm going to learn as it looks like a good time. Prices here are nice $3 for a day pass and $10 for a yearly membership. These day passes don't wipe off the rental rates though, you can look at the $3 as a fee every time you go and the $10 would wipe that fee for next time. Rates are $11 an hour for billiards and $12 an hour for snooker. 

Place is very nice inside and super clean. There's flat screens everywhere and banquets along the walls so you can chill out while playing. Tables are kept in good condition and are perfectly flat. Drinks are reasonable at $4 a bottle of domestic. Food is served here too but I've never had it.

Overall, it is a an awesome place to hang out in the Richmond Hill/Markham area. Prices are decent and good times are to be had. Check out the VIP out back.... pretty sweet.",2

The Ladies in charge were not good at communicating when things went wrong (him not listening/other kids being mean to him) and the place itself was not well kept. Also the people at the front desk were not the nicest. I had a receptionist tell my son to un tuck his school shirt from his pants (this was part of the school uniform).

My pet peeve about this place is half the items they offer are always empty. Don't get me wrong the staff for the most part is very friendly and has no problem cooking a new batch for you but why is that not already done before it ask for it? If you advertise yourself as a fast food chinese place I don't want to have to wait 5-10 minutes for you to cook a fresh batch the employees when something is running low should tell the cook hey we're running low on ....

Take your traditional Manhattan (whiskey or bourbon, bitters, sweet vermouth and don't forget that cherry) and put it on a flight to Hong Kong and this is what you'll get: A delicious concoction of rye bourbon, ginger liqueur, sparking sake and bitters. Sweet, smooth, spicy.  I am a sucker for anything ginger, so I had high hopes for this cocktail and it did not disappoint.

 I am not going to try to guess the alcohol content of this beverage, but let's just say that I was in no position to order a second. Next time I will bet trying the Shiso martini: orange vodka, ginger liqueur (yeah!), barley liqueur and fresh shiso. I'm counting down the minutes...

16858,2,1547337600000,"I just purchased a Queen size American Dream Plush mattress made by Kingdom a few days ago from Half Price Mattress Company. I have to say the experience was fantastic.

These guys close at 6pm on weekdays, and when I had called, it was already past their closing time by several hours. Regardless of the fact they'd been closed for well over 90 minutes when I called (Perhaps 2 hours even), Bobby was more than happy to come open up the store for me to take a look at the mattresses after he finished dinner. He told us all about the beds, helped me find the most comfortable one for me and even negotiated a deal for me for the mattress without a foundation. The mattress was delivered the very next day, on time, sealed and in perfect condition.

There was no pressure to buy from Bobby, even though it was 3 hours past close when I finally was able to meet him there and I felt very comfortable the whole time.

The mattress is very plush and so far seems very good quality, though I've only had it for 2 nights so far. I've slept phenomenally for the last two nights though!

Super happy with my experience with these guys. Much better than the commissioned sales I experienced at RC WIlley, where the salesperson was trying to justify everything I wasn't happy about with their options.

The good:

There are plenty of shops and places to eat. The service I received was good.

Staff at shops, security and United check in were pleasant and easy to interact with.

Lots of space and seating in most areas.

The bad:

The signage to find a taxi is not well placed. After getting my bag I walked around awhile before I could find out what direction I need to head in. Maybe it's me, but the guy I was traveling with had the same complaint.

The airport has several long corridors that don't offer moving walkways. This can be problematic if you are in a hurry to reach a connecting flight or you need to be somewhere quickly.

But even for clients that go bi weekly you will still see amazing results.
I started off with the Material Girl lash look and then upgraded after a few months to Who's that girl volume Lashes. She has sizes and now even colors for every clients liking. I wanted more volume for my model photos so that's why I did the upgrade. I also get Who's that girl lash extensions on my bottom lashes as well. So very full! love love!! The bottom lash extensions :D
I work full time and model full time so I like to go to Lisa every week. She does my lashes right before every photo shoot I have so they're nice & perfect before I shoot.

Well, glad that it was basically free because the food was terrible! The NY strip was so thin that it turned out tough. The salmon was tasty, however. The gravy for the potatoes was an artificial-looking stark white it made me wonder what it was made of. We were supposed to be served carrot cake but the cake that was served seemed to be a cross between carrot and spice, heavy on the spice. And moist it definitely was not - the side of the cake was extremely dry like it had been sitting out for days. I was very disappointed in the food, especially since we love to patronize the smaller, non-chain local restaurants. But unfortunately we won't be trying this one again.",2
16936,3,1546905600000,"I can't say enough good things about Ron Williams and Mike Seifer at Allstate - Mike Seifer and Associates.  I am a Real Estate Agent and not only do I have my own insurance through them, I refer all of my clients to them because I trust that they will have the best customer service experience that they have ever had with an insurance company.  Having to deal with an home or car accident is hard enough, but they really help to alleviate some of that stress and work hard to make everything whole again.  

Ron and/or Mike have been present for every claim that I, or any of my clients have had!! One claim that my client had was pretty large and Ron cut his vacation short to come home and work to make sure the client was happy and the claim was going to be paid for him.  Any claim that I have seen them work on has been paid promptly and they go over and above to make sure that the clients are completely satisfied.  And even if you don't have a claim, Ron is so easy to work with and great at taking care of payments and insurance adjustments when we have had to make changes on our policies and we never have to wait long for answers.  It is customer service at its best and I would proudly continue to refer them to my clients!!",2

My buddy's sweet-and-sour chicken wasn't what we were expecting, but it was great, too. The service was friendly and nice.

I guess the people who own this came from France, so the cafe is themed accordingly with a very quaint feel. Their menu is pretty expansive, offering breakfast, lunch (sandwiches), smoothies, and of course plenty of coffee and teas. I ordered the croissant and egg breakfast sandwich, and WOW I don't know what they put in it but it was phenomenal. I also ordered the mango smoothie to go with it, and that was delicious as well. The service was excellent too - you can tell it's a mom and pop kind of place, rather than your typical chain coffee shop like you see everywhere in Vegas. And even though the location is kind of hidden (they're located in a business plaza), they were busy the entire time we were there! My friend who brought me there also mentioned the few times she's been she's noticed the regulars are usually French, and speak French to the owners! Which I thought showed the cafe's authenticity.

16975,3,1548720000000,"Great location and hotel - just not as perfect as previous visits

If you want beautiful, spacious room in a smoke free hotel in the northern Strip this is the hotel for you.  I LOVE the location - on the strip but not ON the strip.  The Fashion Show mall is right across the street so all the shops/restaurants of the mall along with the Wynn/Encore, Venetian/Palazzo, Ti and Mirage are all a short (mostly) air conditioned walk away.

That said...everything was just a little off this time.  I usually visit for a longer than 'normal' stay and in the past when checking in I would get,  'I see you're with us for some time...can I offer you an upgrade' or 'I'm sorry, but we're fully booked over the weekend portion of your stay so this is best room available.'  This time, nothing.  And while the breakfasts are usually uniformly wonderful I had an off breakfast this time - the Eggs Benedict came back hard poached.  And previously when I put the 'housekeeping please' light I've always come back to a cleaned room.  This time I put the light on and left at 9:30 then came back at 3:00...to an unmade room.  At base, nothing horrible...just not the perfection of my previous visits.

Lastly, if you are travelling with younger guests, you should note that the hotel is no longer allowed to serve breakfast to people under 21 in their restaurant (because there is a small bar in the back). As an alternative, they have set up a 'to go' breakfast station in the lobby (and of course offer room service).",2

16993,3,1548115200000,"This place might get such a good rating from me because it reminds me so much of my favorite place to see a concert back home (the Uptown Theatre). I'm very into old-style converted venues. Also, because the first band I saw there was The Gaslight Anthem, and c'mon, how could that be a bad thing?

The stage is set high and offers a great view from pretty much anywhere (if you can score a spot on the railing at any level you're completely set). The sound is also one of the better systems I've found in these parts. 

I don't find it hard to get to as the Queen streetcar runs regularly enough and stops just a short block away. However, I do find the post-show trip complete with crack addicts on said streetcar harassing everyone for money to be less-than-desirable, but what can you do. 

Annoyingly there are no ins & outs, mostly because there is a strange little cafe of sorts attached to the venue (you can enter from the sidewalk/smoking area or from inside) that wants you to buy overpriced fries and such. So if you need some ""fresh"" air (which, you probably will because there seems to be zero ventilation inside the building) you'll be stuck hanging out in the smokers patio. 

If you drink there are plenty of bars here for you. The main bar at the back of the top tier of the floor area and 2 smaller bars on the sides of the main floor itself. There is also a bar on the balcony level when it's open (for larger shows). 

Security was very thorough (2 people looking at all the ID's, bag searches for girls / pat downs for guys) but really laid back about it. The girl in front of me first got busted on her fake ID, but they just Xed her hand and she went on. Then security found her ""pot-in-the-mints-container"" stash and dumped it ... but STILL let her go to the show. Where I'm from, you'd probably be arrested for either of those things on the spot, so this was definitely surprising. 

All in all it's a good mid-sized concert experience and I won't hesitate to snatch up tickets when good bands stop by and play here.",2
16996,3,1547596800000,"We wanted to try this place for lunch based on the great reviews. It's owned by the people that own High Tide next door - which we love.

Upon entry there is a sign saying ""take a menu and seat yourself"" there were no menus and we needed a table for 8 which they did not have until we requested.

We were seated and never saw a server or member of staff for 15 minutes until someone came and put a bowl of chips at one end of the table. We asked for a second bowl of chips for the other end but never received them.

I decided to ask for service and I was promised that someone would be with us shortly. Two tables were served before us even though we were seated well before them. 
We still didn't have menus, glasses of waters, or plates for the small bowl of chips placed at the top end of the table which clearly was not enough to share between 8.

After asking twice for menus, being giving a bowl of chips with no plates or utensils, no water and zero service, we decided to walk out after waiting over 25 minutes - and yes I timed it after having to ask for menus the first time so it was probably closer to 40 minutes.

For management: This place is NOTHING like High Tide in regards to service, your staff seemed nonchalant about us walking out and didn't seem to care for our business when we were there. The self seating isn't working as I saw other people struggling to find tables and customers arguing over their bill. 
I would rethink this system and start a full service like High Tide",1
16998,1,1546905600000,"The best Korean restaurant in Las Vegas! We showed up at 4pm today and the place was pretty full which was a good sign. As we walked in, I immediately notice how cute the ambience and decor was, it had a lot of character. Located in a corner spot near KFC and a nondescript business center. The industrial interior has been designed with props, posters, and artwork from the '80s and '90s.

There were few menu items, serving only beef and pork and concentrating on the quality of the ingredients. 

The best part is they actually cook for you and the servers alternate if your original server is busy with something else. No need to worry about getting them burnt the servers will save you the trouble!

We ordered the Hobak Family Combo ($51.99 for Small, $84.99 for Large) - includes Hobak Marinated Skirt Steak, Hobak Aged Short Ribs, Angus Boneless Short Ribs, Grilled Spicy Pork Belly, Bean Paste Stew, Steamed Egg, Vegetables, Cheddar Cheese, and Rice

Amgus short rib meat was so juicy and tender.  Also the marinated skirt steak was tender and sweet.

The tables have electronic buttons built in so if you need service or want the check, just touch the button. 

Their motto is ""sharing great things,"" they encourage groups to enjoy the charcoal and gas cooking experience.

First off- had an awesome, awesome server. I believe his name was Danny? He spent so much time with us analyzing the menu, giving suggestions, and checking in on us. He was great!!

Overall, we really liked the food. The truffle fries were absolutely amazing (and I always like truffle, but sometimes feel like it's not worth the price). But these were incredible. My steak frites and sides of Brussels sprouts and mushrooms were tasty, but I didn't love my dining companion's scallops. They tasted a little on the fishy side to me.

The bread to start was delicious, and I can't remember dessert for the life of me (safe to say it was fairly unmemorable I guess?)",2
17023,1,1546387200000,"I have driven past the Coffee pub more times than I care to remember- because until yesterday, they were usually always closed. But finally, I made it by when they were open!

Walked in toward the end of lunch for a takeout order. I went with their daily special, the Baja Chicken sandwich- chicken with olives and onions and a chipotle sauce and two kinds of cheese, with tomatoes, and lettuce. Each sandwich comes with a side, (potato or pasta salad, chips or fruit)- I chose the pasta salad. I also added the Chai This blended drink- chai, banana, protein powder, and soy milk.

Service was friendly though they nearly mixed my order up with a group order.  Dining room with the barista is surrounded by windows and has almost an old school diner feel to it- but there is far more space in the other adjacent dining room than I expected. Larger than it appears on the outside.

Got home with my meal- sipped the chai drink as I drove and it was delicious! A bit steep at over $6 for a 24 ounce cup, but it was tasty. Sandwich was $8.50 including the pasta, and the sandwich itself was enormous! I only ate half and gave the other piece to my BF, along with the pickle. Pasta salad was also a decent portion, served in a lidded Styrofoam cup to keep it cold and prevent spills. Also fresh and flavorful, with bits of tomato and a creamy white sauce similar to salad dressing.

Delicious sandwich, good portions, lots of variety on menu- will come back to try another sandwich, or perhaps a soup. Today they were out of cream of mushroom, but let me know it usually sells out fast.",2

17056,1,1548547200000,"Restaurant review:
AYCE Chicago style pizza in Champaign, I couldn't pass up the chance to eat the pizza lunch buffet during the weekday. I quickly hopped into my car and jetted to this location for my lunch hour. I was surprised to find that there was plenty of seating in the restaurant. Staff was super friendly and I was off to the races to eat pizza. Now the ""Rush Street"" pizza bar is 8.49 Monday to Friday 11AM to 1:30 PM. They give you a choice of salad or the two soups (tomato bliss or chicken green chili soup). I was took the tomato bliss, very rich tomato soup. I wish they had some cheese to go with it. I proceeded to gorge on the pizza selection and the calzone. My impression is that they don't have any deep dish pizzas which is unfortunate when you think chicago style pizza the deep dish is the cornerstone. Lots of other pizza selection from meat lover to veggies to hawaian. The calzones were prepared well. The pizza is super hot so let it cool down just a little bit before diving in. Overall the pizza is comparable to other restaurant quality pizza and a bit better than the chains (papa johns and pizza hut). They are not kidding when they tell you that this is for the rush hour lunch crowd. Before I finished my soup, the check was on the table in case I had to pay and run. Service was friendly. Also and FYI you can request pizza for the buffet. So all and all the pizza is relatively good quality, but missing a deep dish would have pushed it over the top. Finally the chocolate chip cookie is a bit too small and just a odd way to end the meal. You get just a small one...

Pro: AYCE lunch pizza buffet, better than papa john or pizza hut, super fast service

Cons: No deep dish pizza, if it is not busy you may have a very limited selection. There was 4 pizza types and the calzones and breadsticks

Hidden gem:
AYCE Lunch pizza buffet. For the pizza lovers",2
17056,2,1548374400000,"As for the comments regarding service I'm going to treat those as outliers because my experience was superb. The only items that aren't available in the buffet are alcohol and specialty drinks.  You need to ask your server for those. That's pretty much it. Also this is a 1000 seat, high volume eating emporium. If you're looking for your server to provide constant attention at a place like this then you will be disappointed. Also what is wrong with you?

There are dozens of options that you will not find at most buffets, specifically the live cooking stations. There's a carvery and your standard Chinese buffet fare. But the fact that there are options that offer a somewhat healthy alternative is refreshing. 

Bottom line the food tastes good. The service is good. Soft drinks and bottled water are included. Have fun and leave satisfied without spending a lot.",2

   Food - Better than good but not quite great  (4-)
   Service - Our Waitress was stellar  (5)
   Ambiance - Decent although felt somewhat crowded and loud  (Low 3)

All in all, this place deserved better than a 3 star rating but I don't think it is one of the better 4 star places.

Longer Version:
We tried this place out on our last trip to Phoenix to add something a little different to the mix of seafood and southwestern places we tend to frequent on our trips to the desert.  We went to Windsor after a day and the Desert Botanical Gardens so wound up getting there shortly after sunset.  It took us a few passes to find the place as signage is small and not very visible.  Parking is in back (where the main door is) but the only wide handicap spots are in front (by the back door).  This little bit a confusion left us entering the back side after multiple trips up and down the street.  Not a great way to start the evening but we were willing to give it a try.

Since it was too hot for us outside, we chose to sit indoors.  The AC was not very efficient.  The floors were basic hard floors and the walls were mostly flat brick.  The overall visual effect was not bad but then again not particularly good either.  However; this made the auditory effect quite LOUD.  All sounds were echoed and amplified making a small place with few actual people quite noisy.  Add to this that there seemed to be too many tables in the small area and the table we were seated at was actually in what should have been a walk way made the overall ambiance a little on the negative side.  Oh did I mention that it was dark?  It was dark too.  A little too dark for our eyes to read the menu.  

Well enough on the weaknesses of the place.  Time for some positives (as there were more to rave about than to complain about).  The service was better than great!  Our server was wonderful - fast, efficient, friendly and helpful.  All the things you want in a server.  She greeted us quickly, offered advice on the menu and fixed my problems right away.  The problem with the overall service was that the host staff didn't seem to care about us at all.  We came in from the street side which is there back door and had to wonder through the restaurant to find the host desk.  When we finally did they did not greet us for a while and actually did not offer to seat us or even put us on the wait list. Oh well bad hostesses are trumped by excellent waitress.


Now for the reason to dine out: The Food!
We started out with a couple orders of the corn dog popper.  Since Big D does not like hot dogs he refused to try them but the rest of us enjoyed them.  We were glad to have them, but at 7 bucks an order I would not get them again.

For dinner I tried the Crab Cake BLT.  The mustard sauce was way too strong.  I had to send it back and get one without the sauce.  Our waitress was very accommodating in this regard.  Once the sandwich came back with a side of mayo it turned out to be very good.  I would very much like to try it again but the $16 price tag is a bit high for what you actually get.  Big D had a salad and a side of mac and cheese.  He raved about the mac and cheese but almost regretted the getting a salad instead of a more filling entrée.  Big D loves his mac and cheese and for him to rave about it means it must be more than excellent and the fact that he didn't offer any tastes to the rest of us really drives that point home.  J and L had the Picnic Kebobs and the Pork Ribs respectively.  Both ladies enjoyed their meals.  The kebobs seemed to be the better choice.  For sides the ladies had Coles Slaw - which they shared and loved as it was sweet and fresh - and the Market Vegetable - which they say was a mistake as there weren't enough for the meal.  I had the fries which were crisp delicious and plentiful. 

Overall, the food is better than good but not quite great.  For most items the price is a few bucks over reasonable, entrée portions are good and the sides were decent.  We all agreed that the food was too good to be called a 3 but was not equal to other 4 stars.


This place was too good to be rated with only 3 stars but 4 stars almost seemed to be generous.  It was more like 3 and 5/8ths.",2

17102,2,1548201600000,"I have dined with Chef Bernard over 10 times and it never fails to be like a new first time.  What makes it so special are several things:  1) the food is just fantastic, 2) the wait staff have been there for a long time and know the food and wine/cocktail offerings like a best friend, and 3) Chef comes out of the kitchen to visit the tables and see how you are enjoying everything - and actually deeply cares what you think.  

I've taken friends and clients 4 times this spring and have had most of the appetizers and many of the main courses.  I personally enjoyed the Butternut Squash Ravioli with shrimp, the Veal Tenderloin, the Divers Scallops, and the Paella, and have had tastes of the Sea Bass, Duck, and the Mahi.

My favorite appetizers are the Shrimp Ooh La La and the Pork Belly (to die for!), and the She Crab Soup is a must (being from Charleston I did not believe it could be as good as it is...but it is).

The crust is thin and crispy (as pizza should be!), there is no sugary sweet taste to the sauce, and they do not automatically give you a side of ranch under the assumption that that is an acceptable way to eat pizza.

The food isn't that great for the price they charge, the fish are not fresh and service is extremely slow & bad. We waited 45min for our food to come. Also, the Korean guy waiter was very pushy, after we ordered he kept telling us that the food we ordered is not enough and kept asking if we wanted to order more... like WHAT? Since when did sushi restaurants do this now? And for anyone who wants to dine as a group - don't, they charge you 20% tip without warning you beforehand. I almost feel like we got scammed. All in all just go to another sushi restaurant in the neighbourhood, there're much fresher and better sushi out there at this price.",2

If you are of another ethnicity, there is a very goof chance youll get cut-eye from both customers and staff.    My husband(white) and i(asian) went to this restuarant because the place we orginially wanted to go to wad closed.  We decided to eat on the patio.  And all we got was dirty looks from customers and attitude from our waitress.  She took a very long time to bring us our drinks and take our order.

We ordered the exact same thing.  Calamari, except mine was the dinner and his was the appetizer.  His food came first, and we didnt thing much of it at the moment, so he held off eating his food till mine came.  While waiting he wanted to order another drink, but our waitress avoided our table like the plegue.  So he got up and got his deink himself at the bar.  15min later, my food still hasnt come, so my husband and i started to share his food, thinking we would just split mine when it came.  It was delicious.  Cook on the calamari was perfect.  Gabe us something to look forward to.  Then another 10min went by.  We finally got the waitress' attenetion and asked why my food hasnt come out yet. She said she'd check on it.  Comes out with my plate in about 5 min. 

The food was so bad it deserves its own paragraph.  Texture of the calamari was like it was ready and had been sitting under a heat lamp.  Everything single thing on the plate was salty.  Excessively salty.  The salad, the rice, the potatoes.  It was like salt was sprinkled all over the whole dish just before serving it to me.  

We decided to just pay and leave.  And even that, when i put the money down on the tray, the waitress wished us a good day out of obligation, and my husbanf had to tell her i wanted change back.  And the waitress genuinely asked why?  We expressed our disappointment in the food, and before we could complain about the service, she cut me off to say the foods taste isnt her fault.  Then walked away.  She dropped the change off and left.

I was annoyed because you should never sit a bar for 10 minutes before being greeted, I almost just left but then Aaron decided to help. I ordered a jack and coke. He walked around the bar a bit, then walked out of bar area and I didnt see him for a few minutes. When he did come back it was obvious he had forgotten my drink but he made it quickly and I was happy. Long story short I had to ask for another drink after being empty for a bit, just poor service.

I would think that the frybread would be a little greasy but it was not greasy at all! I ordered the sopapilla with carne asada, which comes with refried beans, lettuce, tomato, and cheese on top of the frybread. Personally for me the bean made it a little to heavy for me even though the sopapilla itself was phenomenal. Next time, I will probably replace the beans with gaucamole instead and ask for extra lettuce for a more fresh and crunch aspect that I want. The salsas that come out in the bottle are really good. My favorite was the spiciest salsa that they have. It had really good flavor. I was a little disappointed because I was hoping it was going to be really hot but it was a little more on the mellow side. The chip here are homemade and I would not expect anything less of this family ran restaurant. The chips were delicious! The chips are thick and they are cooked perfectly to have this amazing crispiness and the texture was on point! I love that they have the fast food quickness but have the option to dine-in with actual ceramic plates. I really feel like I was coming into their home to have dinner.

I've been to Melanie's for dinner twice and really wasn't that impressed, but I did hear that their brunch was pretty killer, so I decided to give it a whirl and was thoroughly impressed.

To me, the clear winner on the menu was the Newfoundland breakfast special: pan fried cod cakes poached eggs, finished with herb hollandaise, fresh fruit, country fries and toast.

Though it looks small, and carries a heavier price tag than I was anticipating ($13), it was worth every penny and a maybe even a few extra nickels. The eggs were perfectly soft-poached (a lost art), the cod cakes incredibly smooth and flavourful and the herb hollandaise was worth the order alone.

The pizza was a bit light on the veggie toppings and a bit too heavy handed on the cheese for my taste. I prefer the opposite.

YZ's is a bit confusing, it has Taiwanese/Chinese style hotpot but sell Yakitori and show cases decor that is Japanese. I ordered the Spicy Beef Hot Pot with Ponzu sauce and a side of quail eggs.

The hot pot broth was indeed spicy, came with 50% cabbage, enoki mushrooms, 3 slices of beef, imitation crab, clear noodles, tofu. The side order of quail eggs was a joke, there was only 3 and were oddly hard and rubbery in texture. Other than spicy, the broth was bland. The ponzu sauce was overly garlicky and was spicy due to it's rawness and didn't accent the flavors of the hot pot. To be honest, the items in the hot pot didn't taste fresh and my flame went out 5 minutes into eating.

The service is spotty, had to waive down the waitresses a couple of times and didn't really recommend anything or mentioned what they served at YZ. 

For $12, I left unsatisfied and they had included an automatic gratuity which had caused some confusion. Since they had an optional addition of tip below that auto gratuity, I'd rather decide if I'd like to tip a certain percentage or not.

Anthony quoted me for the part and labor and I told him I'd call to let him know. It turns out, his quote was much lower than the several other places I called to compare. He started the work Monday and had it done Tuesday, as it turns out I also needed a new relay. 

Two weeks later, I discovered my trunk wouldn't open. I called and Damien said to bring it in and they'd take a look. If it was just a fuse, they'd fix it for free. It turns out it was a fuse and a wire, which they replaced, and they also fixed my running headlight that was out. I was there for less than an hour and was charged nothing.

You'll get a card that places all your purchases on it.  You go where you want, get what you want, and pay at the front when you're ready to leave.  You're a big boy...you can do it.

The food here is nice.  I've only had the pizza and salads and haven't been disappointed.  Every employee I've encountered had been more than helpful.

My only advice to Vapiano would be concerning the pizza condiments at the end of the pizza counter.  A spoon and a container of crushed red pepper make for a difficult experience when putting red pepper on your pizza.

They just opened and the place was PACKED.  I couldn't help but thinking that we would wait at least 20 minutes for our food. To my surprise, it came out in less than 10!  It was very, very quick.

Plenty of seating space.  Friendly empmloyees that come around asking if you need anything and they even come around with a tray when you're done eating with napkins, mints, toothpics, etc.

Its like a fast food restaurant with waitresses, but not really.

The food was awesome. I got the #7 Grilled Chicken Salad. It was awesome.  The mint-green dressing and the roasted corn on the salad was most memorable.

My friend got a Chicken Avacado Wrap and he thought it was good.

The drink choices are good.  They have the Low Calorie Lemonade from Minutemaid and then they also have CHERRY COKE!

I'll definately be coming back to this place soon.",2

17347,1,1547251200000,"I came here for lunch as it was nearby one of my relatives places. Seeing how I always seem to notice this time every time I go to Legend, I decided to try it out.

We ordered the following:

- Xiao long bao x 2: I'm a sucker for the crab meat filling, which this place has. For some reason I do prefer crab meat over the regular pork broth, and this place was no exception. However considering the price I paid ($7.25 x 2) I still prefer Ding Tai Fung's, even though theirs don't have crab meat.

- Drunken chicken: The slices were quite small compared to Ding Tai Fung...also the alcohol taste wasn't that strong. That actually was a good thing though since I was DD for that day.

My relatives also ordered other stuff which I forgot (and didn't bother having as I wasn't hungry). I did notice service was quite slow, especially since there wasn't many people when we arrived. It seems to be a family business, as some people who served us looked like the owner's daughters.

We aren't extremely adventurous when it comes to ""trying"" new things (yikes!) because once we truly enjoy a restaurant, we become regulars aka furniture at the place. However, we haven't been ""sold"" on a sushi place yet..so we decided to venture off and try Moong, WHY NOT?

I was surprised at how small the inside was but to be honest it was cozy and comfortable. We were attended as soon as we sat down with some yummy tea and our waitress was extremely friendly.

We got an order of the spicy chicken which is accompanied by soup, salad and rice. We also got an order of the chicken teriyaki lunch bento box which comes with shrimp and veggie tempura, soup, rice, salad and edamame. 

The spicy chicken was tasty (and spicy- go figure) but I personally wouldn't order it again..but my beau quite enjoyed it. The salad was so delightful. It had a roasted sesame type of garnish that adds such a unique flavour to it. I honestly would order a large bowl of salad if that was an option (is it?)

My bento box was amazing, I just wish there was a little bit more variety with the veggies. They had a lot of squash but if they mixed in maybe some mushrooms or broccoli, it would keep the taste buds a little bit happier. I love how the chicken wasn't over cooked and dry, it was actually moist and yummy.

Overall,  it was a great experience and will certainly be back for more : )",2
17363,2,1547769600000,"*PRICES HAVE INCREASED* 

Came here one Sunday to fulfill a fish and chips craving. I have never been but have driven by numerous times and was always curious.

Dated diner feel inside, with wood paneling on the walls and a bit dank and dim. Don't expect anything fancy. Not too big but we were able to get one of the last two empty tables around noon on a Sunday without a wait.

Reasons for only two stars:

1) Price - ridiculous. One piece fish and chips is $19. Two pieces is $35! This is insane for a diner meal. Yes, the portion is quite big (mainly fries tho, the piece of fish is large, but not large enough to warrant the price). I wish they would slim down on the hefty fry portion and then slim down the price with it. Although it was good (good. not great) (also - fries were overcooked and not hot) and gave me my fix was definitely NOT worth $19. 

2) Tartar Sauce - if you advertise as a fish and chips joint and charge insane prices for said fish and chips, at least serve some proper tartar sauce. Doesn't need to be 'house-made' but get a pre-made tub of good stuff like other restos do. Instead they serve those nasty solo packets that you would get in a food court setting which imo is the nastiest tartar sauce out there. But for real - if you are charging me $19 for one piece of fish and chips, you better compliment it with proper tartar sauce...

3) DON'T SIT NEAR THE BACK!!! - we learned this the hard way. Aside from it being very cold in the back, it is also right beside the back door, which is also the door to the washroom. And every. single. bloody. time. someone exits or enters you have a nice huge whiff of OUTHOUSE stank. Smells like musty sewer and the smell is overwhelming. How can I enjoy my overpriced $19 fish and chips with crappy tartar sauce while smelling and almost tasting TOILET& SEWAGE. Believe me. it's tough.

4) Service - tbh it wasn't terrible and they were friendly enough considering it IS a diner. But it lacked in a lot of ways. When we entered, instead of smiling at us or guiding us to a table or simply telling us to 'take a seat anywhere' the waitress who was holding a broom and sweeping just looked at us annoyed and asked us to move, as she wanted to sweep where we were standing. Not sure what to do we sat ourselves at one of the two last remaining empty tables which was covered in droplets of milk. We then waited 15+ minutes to even get a menu. We encountered the same wait time when trying to get a container for the leftovers and the bill. Yes, it is a diner. But if your 1 piece fish and chips served with fake tartar sauce and a side of bathroom is $19, I think you can up your service just a tad.

Overall, food is decent, prices are crazy, and seeing that we live in a city filled with great food choices, I would pass on this place.",2
17367,1,1548374400000,"If I could add fireworks and shooting stars to this review, I would.  These guys saved the evening last night for my friend's birthday.  

After a scheduling snafu at The Blue Hound, The Arrogant Butcher graciously accepted our party of 20.  I was dubious about how the service would be due to the large group, but they exceeded my expectations.  We had a dedicated server who was extremely nice and resembled a cheery Christmas Hobbit.  Drinks came out fairly quickly and after a short wait at the bar, we were shown to a private dining room.  

The have a really adventurous cocktail menu so if you're feeling brave, give it a go.  Bring your smartphone as you may have to google many of the ingredients (I enjoy exposure to new things so this is definitely a plus for me).  

The pretzel fondue appetizer is heaven on earth encased in doughy salty cheesy goodness.  The chicken stroganoff was pretty fantastic as well and they get extra points for house made pasta.  I found it odd but charming that the menu listed ""frozen peas.""  (More points for honesty!)  My dining companions seemed very pleased with their meals and one person was especially enthusiastic about the mussels and oysters.  

Desserts were fantastic as well.  The warm peanut butter cup is nothing short of amazing.  It's the kind of thing you would say is ""just okay"" in order to avoid sharing.  The salted caramel pudding was delicious as well.  (And if you all could turn that salted caramel pudding into bread pudding, I will personally head up a new religion devoted to it.)  

I learned about this restaurant a couple of years ago at the Devoured event and it's been on my to-do list.  Although we didn't set out to dine here last night, I'm certainly glad we did.  Thank you Arrogant Butchers!",2

I always get the shrimp wonton with egg noodle; the wontons of nice and plump with very little fillers and all shrimp  I do believe that they make their own egg noodle, please don't quote me on that! 

Their house made chilli oil, is sooo spicy for me personally one little pea size drop is good. 

I do like the cozy, kind of in your own house vibe it gives. The tea/water is self pour and you pick your own seats most of the time.

17394,3,1546905600000,"This place is BYOB which I LOVE and I remember coming here and loving it in the past - this trip was, unfortunately, not as great as I remembered.  

We walk in and there are a total of 4 customers in this huge restaurant and that's including the 2 of us that just got there - yikes!  I guess it did fill up with 2 more tables by the time we left though... 

Our server Yanni was great - we were his only table so we got lots of love from him which I appreciated.  I wanted the food to be better than it actually was especially since the prices were higher than I remembered. 

The bread they give you is a garlic toast that I couldn't stop eating - so good.  Our apps of the breaded eggplant and the artichokes (served cold) were a great start.  They were a little heavy handed with the vinegar on the salad which is when the meal started to turn.  I got my penne in vodka sauce which was so incredibly salty.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE salt but I couldn't figure out if it was super salty from the prosciutto or just from it being overly seasoned.  Aside from it being distractingly over salted it was just ok-the sauce didn't blow my mind.  My husband's lamb chops ordered medium rare had to be sent back due to them being too rare.  Honestly, if the restaurant were slammed it would be more forgiveable but we were the ONLY customers they were cooking for - how'd they get it wrong? I guess the lamb chops were delicious once they came back the 2nd time around.  

Maybe it was an off night but we were disappointed - especially for it being more pricey than I remembered and with so many places to go/try in Pittsburgh we will, sadly, not be back.",3
17395,3,1546387200000,"This place is a complete joke.  My burrito had one spoon of cheese.  They hire kids who don't know how to count change.

I asked for burrito sauce, they go ""we don't have any"".  Tasted so plain :(  The hot sauce isn't even that hot.  It lacks the real burrito ingrediants, such as fried onions and green peppers.

The menu does change, but you can always count on the stetson chopped salad.  You can usually find some sort of pork belly dish on the menu, but this one was my favorite one from them.  The mac and cheese was great, too!.  Now for the scallops....they were nicely seasoned,  but the risotto did not taste like risotto.  It was not creamy at all!

After a mellow night of sipping drinks around Downtown Vegas, my belly called and said, ""put burritos in me"", not one to argue with the body, I did as such. But instead of rehashing the same old spots near DT I was decided to venture down Charleston see what the, ""hood"" had to offer.

Enter Tacos Mexico, and old school spot complete with dated restaurant furnishings, a jukebox, and the savory smell of fried pork and tortillas, nummy numms. I went with the Al pastor burrito, filled with marinated and grilled pork, rice and beans. To be honest I've never had an Al pastor burrito with rice and beans, normally it's just meat, chopped onion and cilantro. This variation of the burrito was still tasty, but the addition of house made salsas was needed for that extra little kick. 

The meat was a little under seasoned and I could have done without the rice and beans, but I'm assuming they use these as filler for the burrito. All in all no big complaints and very fast service which is really all you can ask for from an all night fast food joint.",2

Had the goat cheese side salad.... very fresh and good. And the lobster bisque. I did wish there was more lobster...I almost feel like I got the top of a fresh batch which isn't bad but you can't go wrong with more lobster. A bit price for just a cup though.... 6.

Service was mediocre. Server seemed to be just going through the motions. Very polite and nice but she was acknowledged a couple of times and just walked off. My sister and I wanted a glass of wine and asked a few questions and she left us without taking our order! Maybe we gave the wrong impression but we both looked at each other a bit confused. We also think our wine was switched but by the time we saw her again to ask our food had bee.n delivered by others and we liked what we had anyway. Would have been nice to know though.

We went to the L'Atelier du Joel Robuchon the previous year and really enjoyed it, so we were excited to try this. And it didn't disappoint. I felt like I was inside a jewel box. The colors and textures are beautiful. Rather than go into a blow-by-blow of our evening, which many others have done really well, I will say that we enjoyed the entire experience from start to finish. Everything was divine...from that tantalizing bread cart all the way to dessert. The service was impeccable. This is a very special place...a really unique experience that we will not soon forget...if ever!",2

17531,1,1547942400000,"I love everything about this place. It would be a cool venue in any city, but considering it is the the entertainment wasteland that is Phoenix, the Crescent Ballroom is exceptional.

Most of the shows I've gone to in the past year have been either here or at the Marquee. Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum! Compare the friendly staff to the surly workers at the Marquee. The wonderful temperature control versus the sweltering heat. The clean, plentiful bathrooms instead of cesspool restrooms. And what about the free water stations, great cocktails, stadium seats, and a damn tasty veggie burro big enough for two?

All of these great elements make Crescent Ballroom a shining star in Cen Pho. In a town where venue after venue is shutting down, I couldn't be happier that this place is thriving.",1

Pros: Wide range of nail colors, neck wrap with scented oil, better than average tea selection, very sanitary.

Cons: you have to make an appointment, the outcome of your nail job may depend on the skill level of the technician (little bit of a dice roll). 

Ona side note the owner of the salon has taken the time to come up with and manufacture a 'Salon 3121' range of products. This tells me that the business is a passion not just an investment.

I stopped into Hob Nobs on my way to Tucson with a colleague who needed a pick-me-up. Having already had my coffee that morning, I tagged along with the intention of leaving empty-handed. That did not happen.

Everything smelled so delicious, and the environment was warm and cozy ... I ordered a chai tea. 

While the barista made our drinks, my colleague was chit-chatting with someone else who perhaps was the owner, or at least the manager. ""Waffles?"" she asked me. ""Oatmeal?"" She had a huge grin and was clearly joking with me. The staff member/owner/manager said, ""the oatmeal comes with bananas on top."" 

""Bananas?"" I asked. 

They laughed at me.

""Well,"" I said, ""If I can take it to go and actually eat it in the car, I'll have some.""

We are satisfied with both the boarding and grooming services.  They are responsive via the phone and email, although they never sign names, so you don't really know with whom you are communicating.  They offer a military discount, which is really nice. 

One snafu recently, we were 15 mins late picking up the pups after a long holiday weekend and they wanted to charge us $20 plus the fee for the entire next day.  After a few calls back and forth with their shift manager, the owner finally waived both after I threatened to never bring them back, not tip, and write a negative review.  Of course, I agreed with paying the late fee, but they were kind enough to waive that too.  For that reason, we will return and I wrote this review to describe our positive experiences, but I do think the owner may want to re-think their flexibility and policies, particularly for rare occasions and return clients (which fit this situation on both accounts).

Overall, a positive experience.  There have been very minor billing errors and sometimes, you have to wait a while to get checked in but the place is very clean, convenient, and the employees seem to care.  Again, our pups get excited going in and out, which is the main thing.",2

I find this the best course for beginner as mainly par-3s and a couple of par-4s which I enjoy. It's not too difficult of a course to where one wants to give up or throw their clubs the grass I would say is mediocre considering it's not a championship of course but living in Arizona with a hundred and ten degree temperatures it is sufficient for me. Rates are reasonable as I used to to book my reservations but once again it's also the hottest part of the day.

Sad to say we were sorely disappointed. I shit you not, I have had a better steak at Chili's before and I fucking hate Chili's. Bf paid an exorbitant amount for 3 meatballs and over-seasoned mediocre fries. I got an awful over-seasoned (COVERED in black pepper), under cooked (ordered medium rare and got rare), tasteless, dry filet mignon steak. It came pre-cut so I assume the juices disappeared once the chef or server carved the meat before it got to our table.

Only redeeming dish were the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumplings, but even that wasn't enough to make this more than a disappointing meal.

Total came up to $105, which is crazy for the quality (or lack of) we received. I was kind of expecting the bill to be discounted a bit because the manager came by to ask us what was wrong since we told our server the food was ""alright."" Not coming back again.

He had already buffed and put the nails on all of my fingers.. I showed him a photo of what I wanted which came from their FB page. While I was getting my toes done when I showed him the photo I simply said I want this, pointing to the photo of long obmbre / coffin nails. When it came time to do my nails I sat down and he got to cutting the length, I said it's a little short for the coffin nails can I get it just a little bit longer? He takes the nail off puts on another, cuts it a little longer then says.. oh that will be 5 more dollars. I said well I showed you what I wanted earlier and you told me it was 60$ so why are you now telling me 65$ he says oh I thought that you wanted just the style of nail. I said if I only wanted the style of nail I would have specified that. I would have clarified from the beginning that I want the style only. So basically because I was vocal about what was happening instead of charging me the 60$ he said from the beginning he says he's tired and he can't do my nails. Lol! I got to this salon at 4pm.. it's is now 7pm I was not the last person in the shop.. there were others.. he acted like he had the time to do my nails and what I wanted but when I had an issue with him trying to over charge me after he had already told me one price all of a sudden he's tired, then he has no reason to not do my nails, then it was I usually ""enjoy do nail"" but I can't do your nails. Then he says ""Just Get Out"" lol! I've had my fair share of rude and sub par service but this absolutely takes the cake. I said your not going to leave these nails on me and tell me to get out because I'm asking you about changing the price. It is not my fault that you assumed I only wanted the style of nail and not the length. I asked him about the owner he tells me, he makes all of the decisions and that the owner is not going to do anything..

17776,2,1546992000000,"Skyfall Lounge was awesome. Good place to grab a drink and check out the views of the strip from the Delano Hotel (Mandalay Bay Hotel). There's no cover charge to go up to the 64th floor but the drinks aren't cheap. I'd say $13-15 per well drink. It is worth the price though to go up there and chill for a bit. The wait staff and the bartenders were super chill. You'd think being a high-end lounge, the staff would be pushy, nope, not at all. Even though the lounge can be dressy, they actually allowed us to go up in our LA Kings jerseys (we were there for Frozen Fury). Score!

The weather was perfect, Skyfall has an outdoor overlook (with high glass) for patrons to view the strip from the outside. It was cool! There was also a live band that played pretty chill music. 

A nice place to take a date. Good luck with a table though, I think you need to reserve in advance or pay extra. You can just go up and buy a drink and stand around or sit at the bar. There's also a restaurant on the other end as well.

The entrance/elevator to the Skyfall is located in between the Mandalay Bay and Delano hotels (walk past the Michael Jackson theater).",2

As soon as you walk in you get a sense of a warm/cozy environment.  There is a huge fireplace in the main lobby with seating for parties that may have a wait.  

The food is really to die for.  I'm a meat and potatoes type guy so I feel like I've reach the mecca when I'm here.  From the parmesan crusted pork chop to the bacon wrapped filet mignon.  You can't go wrong.  Well, yeah you can go wrong.....don't fill up on the salad bar! It's tempting b/c the salad offerings are incredible but do yourself a favor and step away with a small sample.  

The wait staff was very courteous and quick to serve (with a smile of course).  My date and I were curious to see the kitchen area to get a glimpse as the inner workings and they were more than welcome to accommodate it.  Too bad we were running late to an event so we had to pass :(

This is a great place to experience even if only once.  Couple quick tips/notes is that you should plan on at least an hour to eat here with just two people.  Any more than that and you are looking at probably 1.5 hours to really enjoy it.  Remember pace yourself....the will bring more!  Another tip is that you can still use the valet if you are going to be going somewhere else afterward.  They will park your car and you can just retrieve it from a surface parking lot a few blocks away.  I've found this to be convenient.",2
17779,3,1547942400000,"The Lebo pool is amazing! If you live in town, you can buy a season pass for (IMO, surprisingly compared to other local pools) a very reasonable price. And they have it all! Two fun slides, a diving board, rock climb, and tons of cool stuff in the kiddie area! Adult swim is every day from 11-12, too, which is great. You may have to avoid some areas due to lessons, etc but you'll be fine. The lifeguards even seem great and they do a good job. 
My only complaint would be the parking. With the ball parks, ice hockey, tennis and basketball courts, and parks all in the same area, the lots can fill up fast. I wish there could be more parking, or even parking exclusively for the pool, but I don't think that's realistic so I can dream.

I ordered their version of a Pisco sour to start. It was okay but probably not worth the $12 price tag. We ordered the white bean hummus dip, smoked salmon spanakopita and the bone marrow which were all fine but nothing to write home about. The pork belly and pickled watermelon tacos, however, were phenomenal. We would go back for those tacos alone.

17813,2,1546819200000,"Oops - wrote this review in Oct of '11 and forgot to post it.  Haven't been back since though . . .
10/2011 -- Wow, a year ago I would have rated this place 4 stars but my second experience with new owners is worse than the first. To start, over the last 5 years I have ordered from CoW probably 100 times. I have tried many different dishes but a staple ordered every time was Spicy Noodles, a chef specialty. The delivery guy before new ownership (probably the owner , he seemed invested and was there EVERY time I ordered and handled the phone, deliver, and packaging when I did take out) was the kindest person I have ever had deliver to me. He was over so many times while I was pregnant he asked to see the baby after my son was born. And when we ordered after that he would joke about if Gibson was ready for Orange Chicken yet. Great rapport. I wish I knew his name. I would order from any restaurant he was involved in. 
Enter new owners. I feel weird giving one star for a place I liked for so long, but my last experience went from bad to worse. 
1st was the delivery. After 1 hour 15 minutes I finally called and the answer was pretty rude (keep in mind the online quote for time was 45-60 minutes and past experiences with CoW had been timely).  15 minutes or so later I got a call from delivery saying she was lost and asking for directions. This frustrates me because basically every computer and phone are geared with GPS capabilities. Seems ridiculous for delivery people not to use those tools since that is their business.  This is horrible, but I was actually pissed that my boyfriend gave her a +25% tip (which is generally our m.o.- our delivery peeps love us). 
2nd the food. Quality wasn't horrible but the comparison was miles apart. Spicy Noodles had NO meat of any kind.  This dish formerly had chicken, shrimp and pork so it was a disappointment to have none. Then the crab won tons, another staple with Chinese take out in my opinion. They were over fried and therefore hollow inside. All the filling had been blown out in the fryer so we basically got charred won ton wraps. Both my boyfriend and I had dishes we have had before, me with Hot Braised Tofu and him with the staple Chicken and Broccoli and both were not great and definitely not the flavor and quality we had in the past.  I'm eating the Hot and Sour soup today fir lunch but don't have high hopes after my experience so far. Not to mention they no longer send strips withe the soups which I thought added a great crunch to a nice hot soup. 
All in all extremely disappointing. I have a hard time giving a restaurant I once loved a single star but the new owners should not be able to maintain the same name. They obviously have a new chef and the friendly staff is gone. If any one if the following had been positive I wouldn't have been so harsh but every aspect was a flop;  customer service, delivery, food ingredients, food quality . . . I can't think of one positive thing.  Bummer, I now need a new Chinese restaurant.",2

I got the gnocchi al pesto and I'd go as far as saying it's the best gnocchi (aside from my grandmother's) that I've ever had, and I don't say this about Italian food outside of my family's too often.

I found this place again on my trust Yelp app. By looking at the other reviews, i decided to take a chance. This place is not near downtown so you have to drive to get there, and to me it was worth it.

They have pretty decent AYCE sushi. most definitely not a 3 star place, but not a 5 star either. The only thing that would have made it 5 star if the red tuna (ahi) wasn't sliced paper thin, If it wasn't, this place would get a five star. 

This place is a great find for the AYCE (all you can eat) sushi lovers out there. The restaurant has a great selection for dinner when i went and the price is pretty decent as well. The sushi was all really good and they don't try and fill you up with a whole bunch of rice. The wait staff was always prompt and nice to me. The place was spacious and clean.

They have all different styles of combinations for breakfast along with regular entrees and lunch items. I even saw a vegetarian section for those who don't eat meat. The staff is also very friendly and service was pretty fast in all aspects.

I ordered a new item on the menu called the Roast beef Benedict ($16.95 Canadian) which was a tasty dish. You definitely get your money's worth. The roast beef comes drenched in tasty hollandaise sauce with a delicious balsamic reduction with two poached eggs on top cooked perfectly. Both were placed on top of crispy ciabatta bread and there was a side of delicious home fries. Best part is that it also comes with a large bowl of fresh cut fruits. I added a coffee for an extra $1.50 which was good coffee. Before the coffee I tried this fruit cocktail juice they make from fresh juice ($5.95) which was worth It and delicious as well.

Overall I had a great experience here and would definitely come back. Had a huge delicious meal for under $25 (Canadian money). This place is definitely recommended as a must try.",2

The recommended bone in Filet was not very well seasoned and was overcooked... maybe because it was served on a very hot plate. Grilled Asparagus was good enough. Crab legs (Because they ran out of stone crab claws at 7pm) were not that interesting and had soft rubbery outer shells.  And the service at the bar was completely disinterested and very occasional.

My first impression was that my waiter found my arrival inconvenient (yeah, that kind of waiter).

Second impression: he brought my dessert to me in a chipped bowl. A big chip missing from the top rim. There were not many people there (2 couples), so he wasn't rushed off his feet and should have noticed. He didn't seem to care.

The creme caramel itself was just so-so. Nothing to write home about. Slightly overcooked and rubbery around the edges, more burnt flavor that the classic, nutty toasted flavor to the ""caramel"". 

The allongé was meh.

If you go, do it for the view. But don't expect stellar service and superior quality food.",2
17938,1,1548547200000,"Overall - 2.0/5.0

Hotel lounge style environment with comfortable seating are the good things about this restaurant, but the rest goes downhill from there.

A couple examples: 

Their siu mai dumplings were lacking in flavour and did not come out steaming hot as you would expect if it were in a traditional steamer. They were accompanied with some breaded scallops that were cold, soggy and overly salty from the sauce it was covered in. 

Their egg tarts had this stiff texture on the flakes of the crust that felt like it had been left standing for a while and reheated before it was brought out. The birds nest and pomelo added no value to the overall taste.

This place tries to present themselves as an upscale restaurant serving up dim sum with a bit of modern flare but definitely failed on execution and overall food quality was subpar.

Don't bother wasting your time at this place.",2

I came here during lunch with a group of coworkers. Service was okay, but not above and beyond. At one point my iced tea cup sat empty for a while.

There is a deal where you buy 2 tacos and get one free so I ordered three tacos. I got the ""Fat guy in a little coat"" which was a steak taco, ""It was the Dukes"" which was a pork belly carnitas and ""Get Off my lawn"" which was a stuffed pepper with shrimp and cheese. I wasn't really amazed by any of them. The steak seemed to lack flavor, but the avocado aioli was great. The pork belly was dry and there was not enough flavor for me. The only one that I enjoyed was the stuffed jalapeno pepper with shrimp. The slaw was flavorful. And the stuffed jalapeno part was good and cheesy. It was fried and I kind of regretted it later in the sense of this is so good It's bad for me. Great atmosphere, but for me the food and service were just okay.",3

I would absolutely recommend Laser Quest to anyone looking for an easy party and fun time! One helpful tip for you and your party guests - bring a handful of quarters.

Don't order the vinegar cole slaw, it's bland and has no taste. The corn muffin was very hard and extremely dry.  I became very disappointed when I happened to look at the slate blinds at the window and the window sill.  I don't think that have been cleaned or the window sill wiped since they were put up.

The decor and vibe is very modern. Everything from the reclaimed wood walls, to the pendant lighting above the bar, to the wallpapered bathrooms really just works. I could take some notes from this place on how to decorate my own home! 

Our server was really helpful and outgoing. 

Wine list is quite extensive with the cheapest bottles being in the upper $30 range. None of the cocktails really caught my eye so the Bf and I stuck with wine. 

We ordered three dishes. This was in no way enough food for the two of us, but we were planning on filling ourselves up on beer and eventually Ian's pizza (just reliving my college days...) later in the night, 

We ordered the tuna tartare, which was really refreshing. It was served with rice chips, which didn't add any flavor, but added to the texture! The Pork Belly was mmmm mmm good. No complaints so far. We finished off our meal with the Papardelle, which was creamy and flavorful, but was served a bit too room temperature for my liking, 

As a whole, we loved all of our food. Were we full after our meals? No. Was it pricey? Yes.  But even with these facts taken into account, I enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service enough to recommend it.",2

1. Service is terrible and nonexistent. I say nonexistent because our party at down for a good 30 minutes because we got any water or menus. And this was on top of all the staff ignoring eye contact and our asks for water. We could have prob gotten up, walked out the door, and nobody would have noticed or cared. When we finally waved down one of the waitresses, don't want to name her here, she was bustling all over the place trying to make up for the lack of trying on the part of her manager. Poor girl. 

The service was also horrendous because I got elbowed in the head by the manager. Yup, that's right. I got a pretty standard and disingenuine apology and that was it. Yeah the place was small but hitting your customers in the head, not cool. 

2. Food was meh. Really wish this could have saved the day but in between waiting forever for everything, and feeling pretty much ignored, the raw shrimp didn't help. A few people of our party order tiger shrimp fettuccine. Shrimp came raw, obviously transparent and undercooked and they offer to recook the shrimp for us. Again, that was it. 

As we were leaving, we noticed that other tables also received more shrimp in their pasta than our tables. We wondered about that since our pasta looked very underwhelming. Now we know why, this place chose to provide lesser service to just our table.

Admittedly a little bit of an American Apparel vibe, but that's what's awesome- it just means that you dont deal with egos, fights etc- it's just chill. Standard bar, like $5 Boreal.. Id say the best part is the dancing. Its basically a DJ with maybe a group of like 2 dozen people dancing in the front of the place. One of the best sets I've heard, some Justice, some Kanye, some Latin stuff, some remixed oldies, just everything- truly awesome. No thumping techno here.

We wanted to ""re""model (new install) our backyard (about 1,500 sq ft) with a desert landscape, low water usage, and add some character to the back porch.  When Brett from Nulawn came over to give us a quote, he listened to our ideas and asked how we wanted to utilize the porch and yard.  He brainstormed with us a few design ideas to match our goals.   And Brett even had a few samples of pavers and travertine in his truck for the back porch.  He was able to find an exact match the rocks that we had in the front yard for a seemless look.  We had a couple specific plants that we wanted but were not sure on the rest, so he offered to meet us at the nursery and walk with us while we looked, discussed and decided.  Brett was very patient and gave some wonderful suggestions on the plant selection.  The installation itself was also very smooth.  The Nulawn crew arrived on time and worked throughout the day to get it completed on time.  When it was all finished, they cleaned up the area very well and Brett gave us a walk through.  He gave us suggestions on watering the plants for the first summer while they get established etc. and even walked me through how to program our existing drip system control unit.

18050,1,1548633600000,"El's Japanese Fusion is a good choice for very quick and reasonably well prepared sushi.  I liked the food.  

Now let me tell you what El's isn't ... a Japanese Fusion resaurant.  Not at all.  It's a sparsely furnished diner that serves pretty good sushi.  You go to El's with your pals on a Saturday  afternoon; or you go because you're hungry and in a rush; or you go because a little  time just opened in your schedule... and hey... you're in the neighborhood.  It's a three-quarter step above what most would call a ""hole in the wall"" ... not the venue for a main event.

As for my usual fare, the edemame was good and the salmon sashimi was good.  I always love it when salmon/avocado or tuna/avocado  is on the menu and I got the latter.  Just fine.

Much tastier and cleaner than Denny's or IHOP, but only a grade higher. The bummer part was the coffee. They only offer one kind and they don't carry cold creamer (like half and half) for coffee creamer junkies like me. I just love a hot cup of joe with cold half and half and they don't have it, only little room temp creamers.  Had the German pancake, it was good, but the presentation and playing of it was better. The scrambled eggs were definitely made from liquid eggs, not fresh cracked.... so that bummed us too. A little more pricier than Denny's or IHOP, but overall, it was an okay breakfast joint.",2

18064,1,1546732800000,"My friend and I recently went to eat at the Fran's on Front Street; this was my first time eating-in, although I have had take-out from this location a few times. Much like the other two locations, it is an old-fashioned diner, although this one seems maybe a little more upscale and is open late but not 24hrs. It is located on the ground floor of a tall glass and steel residential building, with an outdoor covered patio. The section that we sat in has mostly booths, with some tables and chairs along the wall, and a full bar with seating near the front door. There was a tv near our table (which required me to explain the finer points of Indy car racing) and two more at the bar, and there was music playing not too loudly in the background. It was not very busy at the time, so the service was pretty quick.

The menu is the same as for the other Fran's locations: all-day breakfast, sandwiches, salads, burgers, desserts. I ordered the Morning Glory, which is one large waffle with eggs and bacon and caramelized apples, and a strawberry float. My friend had the Eggs Blackstone, which is Eggs Benedict with salmon instead of peameal bacon, and a cup of herbal tea. All the food was fine, but nothing special, although I particularly enjoyed the float. Our total bill was $39 for two. Overall, another decent meal in pleasant surroundings.",2

App: Grilled Bruschetta, Bean Puree, Tomatoes, Parsley, Mortadella 
Main: Cheese Gnocchi with a cream sauce 

Fantastic! For those who don't know, Mortadella is ""like bologna"" very thinly sliced and much better, naturally served cold on this bruschetta.

One bland, dry, uninspired omelette (how does a restaurant screw this up?) and one serving of french toast with ""fresh fruit"". Nothing but bananas and sliced apples. It's the middle of the summer in Montreal where neighbourhood fruit stores are overflowing with cheap fresh berries, mangos, peaches, etc... and my french toast is covered in bananas and apple? Talk about dry.

18077,2,1546992000000,"First of all...it's really misleading to call this a coffee shop.  

The espresso machine is a tiny little thing off on the side....but the BAR and taps run for miles.  

So just know it's a bar.  

The tables were all dirty.   The latte I got was too hot and very bitter - either over roasted Starbucks-like bad beans or unclean espresso machine...or both.  

Coffee/espresso drinks are in the higher prices for Phoenix.  The cold/brew toddy was good though.  

Ordered a few bites...mac n cheese and artichoke dip. 

Both came out way too fast: too hot & the artichoke dip had maybe one choke in it.  Decent flavor after it cooked but...the long blonde hair at the bottom ended the appeal 

The mac n cheese.    It wasn't creamy.  Just a thin coating of good tasting cheese sauce but lacking 

Ordered two glasses of wine - wow.  Very expensive and short pours.  Pretty sure the bottle of Charles& Charles at Costco costs the same as one glass here!  

We never saw another staff person after we got started and they didn't seem to care if we were happy.

I've been here several times before and knew this would be a safe bet to give them a taste of Carolina Q without having to go far after a long day at work.

First group was last week and 4 of us sampled a wide variety of offerings from the menu.  They thought the fried pickles were the strangest thing they had ever seen on a menu and had to try them. They could not stop eating them and raving about how good they were.  (I like them too)  Thoroughly impressed with the BBQ across the board as I knew they would be. A great time was had by all.

Well the second group comes into town this week and yes, had heard all about the food/experience from the first group and insisted we had to go.  And the fried pickles were the first thing that asked about and ordered.  Again, a great meal and overall experience was had by all.  I guess this has now become a regular spot for whenever they come over for a visit.

As I said above, I have been here before and Lancaster's is on my ""regular rotation"" of BBQ spots.  I've never been disappointed.  Very casual with good food and always great service.   Prices are very reasonable too.

18098,1,1548374400000,"This Thai restaurant is the worst establishment I've ever been to. I recently moved to Phoenix from Los Angeles and so I've experienced a wide array of Thai food. I am in no shape way or form a noobie to Thai food. After reading the reviews and having been matched with Siam, I decided to give it a go. 
What an absolute disappointment...the first thing that came out was our papaya salad with chicken wings. I don't know if you could even call it that. The chicken was heavily battered in what looked like tempura, it was bland with no seasoning. The chicken was improperly thawed and drained of blood that it had coagulated blood. If you don't drain the blood, it doesn't look very appetizing and you'll get chunks of cooked blood around the joints making your chicken wing look black instead of white. If I wanted to eat blood, I would have gone to a Vietnamese restaurant and ordered Bun Bo Hue. The papaya salad served here were crudely cut and soggy, instead of being fresh and crispy. I felt like I was eating something that was sitting out for too long. 
After deciding that both items were inedible they were pushed aside. We waited for the our main course, panang curry and pad thai. Surely they can't mess this up??! Both dishes are very popular items. I was wrong once again. First off, the wrong type of noodle was used for the Pad Thai. Instead off the rice noodle I was used to, like in all the other establishments I've been to, they used noodles the thickness of vermicelli noodles. To give a better visible, think about chicken fettuccine served with angel hair pasta instead of fettuccine noodles. To make matter worse, there was grease pooled at the bottom of our pad thai dish. A puddle of grease is not something I want to eat, where does that even come from?? 
That was the last straw, I couldn't mouth another fork of food. If this is the quality of food that is served everyday I don't know how long this place has even lasted. This was an extreme disappointment to the point where it makes me mad. I spent close to $50 dollars on my meal and paid over 10% sales tax. 
I will never eat here ever again.",2

Salt cod croquettes
Octopus
Beef tartare

Patatas bravas
Churros
Queso

This was a ton of food for two people -- we were both incredibly stuffed after, and yet there were still more things on the menu we would have liked to have tried (eg brussel sprouts, ribs, and especially more charcuterie).

I'm VERY familiar with the process of how this transaction should've went and have to leave feedback on what could've been improved. For starters when I walked in there was no visible person to greet and direct the ""traffic"". I stood at the front kiosk for approximately 7-10 minutes before anybody came over to find out what I needed help with. I then noticed a young Hispanic women who was holding a tablet that was assisting another customer (ok so they did have somebody out there but who was the back-up) I observed 3 other personal banker's whom had no customers at their desk and began to wonder why they didn't feel the need to jump in?

One large room with about 20 tables, you order and pick up the food at a counter.  Besides your standard, tacos, burritos, tostadas, etc, they had a slew of items that sounded good, but i'll be damned if i knew what they were.

the standard street cart taco ( a couple soft tortillas, meat, onion, cilantro and various sauces from the salsa bar cost 85 cents.  Given my pathetic limitations of low carb, i basically ordered 4 carnitas tacos minus the tortillas , placed in a bowl - very good, yeah, kinda dull, but it hit the spot.

others had the tacos, cuille relleno, gorditas ( i just thought that was a taco bell thing ) tamales and some sort of stew made with pork rinds - it all looked great and everyone was pleased.

the lunch crowd was hopping - that's always nice to see in a local mom & pop restaurant.

Second. 
They were a little busy so there was a wait line, the girl staff member started taking orders up the line. The guy in front did not have enough change ad the girl eve said ""this one is on me""! Wow how can you beat this service? 

Totally impressed. 

The coffee of course is the best in Toronto!",2
18132,2,1548374400000,"This was my first time ordering from Jason's Deli and I ordered the ""The New York Yankee"". I have to say I was very impressed with the size of this sandwich. The meat was nice and juicy and the bread was toasted just right.",2
18137,1,1547942400000,Well I just left Whataburger they had no soda. And all they did was bring up all my items separately and it was just as expensive without the drink. Worst experience at Whataburger ever.,2
18140,3,1546646400000,"I want to love this thrift store, but I don't. Maybe it's because we're still getting to know each other.  

First off, this is a relatively new thrift store that's only been open a matter of months. So, on the plus side, it's in very clean condition. It's also well-organized and items are laid out nicely and not just dumped onto shelves. There seems to be some thought paid to making displays look neat and uncluttered. Also in its favor: this store's salespeople are super-friendly and seem happy to be there (unlike the grouches at the southside Salvation Army). There are nice, unexpected touches here and there too - for example, measurements are listed on the tags of yards of fabric for sale (I can't think of another thrift store in town that bothers to provide this helpful information).

The selection isn't vast yet, but it's decent enough (the dishware area even includes a small selection of barware - sweet!). You'll find clothing for men, women, and children (including juniors and plus sizes); knick-knacks; dishes; books and board games; furniture and lamps; linens; and some religious items. Clothing is generally in good shape, too - you'll see fewer stains and snags.

Sounds good so far, right? My biggest gripe is with the pricing, which is schizophrenic, especially with regard to vintage items. A small McCoy planter is not worth $20 if it has a huge crack in it that runs the entire length of the piece; a vintage purse is not worth $30 if it's stained, frayed, and has a broken zipper. Whoever prices these items seems to think that just by virtue of being old an item is intrinsically valuable. It's not. And the things that effect value - condition, name, commonness - are not taken into account with regard to pricing. 

Thus, pricing is all over the place and doesn't make much sense, so be prepared for that. Does this mean you won't find bargains or cool stuff? Heck no. I mean, like any thrift store what you'll find is largely luck of the draw. I've been to this particular store about a dozen times. Once I found a pair of cute vintage pajamas for around $5, as well as some Melmac plastic cups and saucers for 50 cents a set. At one point they had a huge collection of old-new-stock wide men's ties from the 1960s in awesome patterns that sold for $3 a piece. 

I HAVE found some great stuff here and I WILL go back, but I'm still annoyed with the pricing and feel the store could improve by expanding its selection. Perhaps it will in time.

Open Monday through Saturday 9 AM to 8 PM; closed Sundays. Lots of parking.

Daily specials include the following: Discounts for seniors on Mondays, kids on Tuesdays, ladies on Wednesdays, and men on Fridays; Thursdays offer 50% off ""upscale clothing"" and Saturdays feature a price of 99 cents for all items with a certain color tag.",2
18143,1,1546992000000,"In today's day and age, what separates a brick and mortar business from others, and what makes a store competitive with the convenience of online shopping, is its customer service. Quality people and a welcoming atmosphere at a store will always bring me back.

A Maltese friend of mine was visiting Toronto and he introduced me to this bakery. We made a longish trek to get to it from St. Clair West, then realizing it would have been much faster to simply go up Dundas West, but at least our appetites grew!

This little bakery is tucked away at the west-end of The Junction. They serve the very tiny Maltese community in Toronto with its Pastizzi, almond fingers, Cannolis, sweet bagels and more. The pastries are all traditional Maltese and are an experience to enjoy. At a low cost, try a few things and share with your friends. It'll make a nice morning.

The shop is non-discrete on the outside. Inside, the walls are lined with maps of the Maltese islands, historic newspaper clippings and photos of popular figures at the bake shop. 

You can purchase their Pastizzi and some other desserts frozen for home. They are also available in many stores across the GTA. 

Finally, pick up a pack of Kinnie. It's a bitter-sweet soda that is great alone or mixed with some alcohol :-)",3

Since I'm out of town I Yelped the place and was horrified with the reviews, however my experience has been quite opposite, the doctors have addressed my questions and kept me informed, we were treated fast (and i hope everyone realizes that is the severity of the case that makes them move you faster) and the nurses have been awesome! Specially Adria from recovery who made my kid extra happy giving him a kangaroo plush after the surgery.
After recovery we were moved to a room which is big and private, there are recliners and even a game console plugged in to the tv.
They have a 24 hrs Subway so you don't have to leave the hospital for food.
My only complain is not about the staff but about their equipment, I hear many ""this doesn't work, that doesn't work"", so they should get on it and make sure everything gets fix and in working order.
I will update review after discharge...",3
18183,2,1548201600000,"Came here on a weekday for an escape and catch up with my uncle and was very pleasantly surprised. I'd been to a Bahama Breeze near Seattle a couple years ago and it screamed chain. So did this one upon first inspection, but a few things stood out.

First, our waiter was top notch. Friendly, engaging, knowledgeable, and even engaged us as we asked about how the local dining businesses were faring in the current economic state. He was actually a PT waiter at another restaurant, and he helped us pick our dishes.

The food was surprisingly tasty. I had the jerk chicken bowtie pasta, which was slightly spicy but in a good way.

Although I might not go actively searching for this place next time I am in Vegas, I would recommend it if you're looking for a reasonably priced, tasty meal.",2

This Vons may be in a slightly ""ghetto"" area of town, but the store is perfectly fine and the staff is incredibly nice. In fact, the only reason this Vons could be considered ""ghetto"" is because of the snippy college students frequenting it for their beer runs and mini-fridge stuffing.

Any time I have ever run into this store on the way home from work I have been asked if I needed help finding something and the cashiers are friendly too.

If you think this Vons is ""ghetto"" please go and visit the K-Mart on Bonanza and Nellis. PUH-LEASE! Get it together people. This store is remodeled, ya, it's kind of old, but at least it is clean. The alcohol section is glorious and maybe it doesn't have a bakery, but there IS a bakery located in the same exact shopping center as this Vons. Get yo bread on there.",2

18202,2,1547164800000,"The pro: the only Lee's Sandwiches in Arizona
The con: the only Lee's Sandwiches in Arizona

Had a huge hankering for a Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwich) and missing home where Lee's presence is abundant. Lee's has a pretty large menu, which is typical and sells everything from sandwiches, drinks, pastries, snacks to desserts.

Came in to order a #10 Cured Pork & Pork Sandwich, typically most Banh Mi's come with slices of Jalapeno, Cilantro, Pickled Carrot and Daikon, slathered with mayo and Pate and stuffed with cured meats, such as Cha Lua (cured pork sausage) or other types of deli ham encased in a French baguette. My sandwich was sorely lacking, with only two springs of cilantro, one slice of Jalapeno and literally 4 thinly sliced pieces of ham. Absolutely disappointed, all this in a 10 inch baguette.

I also ordered a Jackfruit Smoothie with boba and found the smoothie absolutely watered down and super sweet. The boba was also not well cooked and not flavored.

Definitely disappointed in my experience here. Spent $ on food served with the bare minimum of quality and service.

This place is also CASH ONLY. If you're a plastic carrying gal like me, you might have to suffer with paying a fee to withdraw from their ATM in the corner.",1

I would have liked some time in between each course.",2
18220,1,1547251200000,"I came here earlier this year, late at night on a weekday. I honestly wasn't expecting too much from their Cantonese-style dessert but I definitely wanted to give it a try since there are hardly any dessert places in downtown.

The waitress wasn't too friendly, but was prompt. We also loved how the menu introduced dessert and gave a whole back story to it. I guess that helps for those customers who have no idea what half the menu is.

We ordered a few snacks: Taiwanese Style Honey Sausage and Deep Fried Chicken Wings. The honey sausage was drenched in oil and was way too sweet. The wings were average.

The desserts we ordered were Fresh Mango with Sago Mixed and Mixed Assorted Sweet Dumplings. The sago mix was really sweet and they had a decent amount of fresh mango in it, but the dessert wasn't cold nor was it hot (it's supposed to be cold), it was more lukewarm which didn't make it appealing after the first bite. The same thing with the assorted dumplings.

All in all, I would come back if I was in that area and craved Cantonese style dessert but given other choices, I'd go somewhere else.",2

I found it to be incredibly lame and will not be going back and suggest unless you need to sleep and want to overpay for that - then I'd avoid as well. The location is on the fashion show mall drive right near Sammy davis jr. drive.

If you are looking for a particular item, swing by and see if they have it - I have a tendency to shop barney's online - that being said I like to get a look at an item prior to purchase - I normally swing thru to see if I can find it in person - Poor Barney's - they rarely have a wide range of sizes - and I'm actually not very impressed with the sale rack, (as compared to online) but they do have some interesting items in stock - 
As others have mentioned its a SUPER small Barney's and I am sad to say I doubt it'll make it - I've never seen anyone else in the store when I'm there!

I was first super excited to see that there was a Vapiano in downtown Charlotte having just discovered the one in downtown NYC.  The one in NYC is super chic, always busy, and urban with a downtown vibe.

This one is downtown Charlotte is nice - modern interior & furniture with a patio, large bar and some nice lounge seating.  BUT it's a lot more open than the NYC location - no upstairs location, less tables, and less people - that's for sure.  You don't get the same busy popping vibe as you would in NYC.  But that's Charlotte for you - this location closes at midnight (MIDNIGHT people, the night doesn't even start until then) and the surrounding bars close around 2, so... what can you do.

Also, I ordered the same exact item I ordered from NYC Vapiano at this location - a Bruschetta pizza - but I was severely disappointed with the Charlotte location's.  The chef just handed me a cheese pizza... with 4 pieces of basil on it.  Whaat?  That's not bruschetta.

But I'm keeping an open mind and maybe sometime in the future, I'll drop by again and see if they can do any better.",1

The process is as much fun as the result.  I would advise wearing gloves, not because the items are so precious, but because you might want an extra layer when you have to move a pile of stuff just to get to the other pile of stuff.

PRO
It's freshly made on the spot and uses real fruits which not gonna lie is a hard thing to come by sometimes. Romeo (I assume) made my drink and asked if I was okay with honey and fat-free yogurt (of course!). From what I can tell, he really cares about his business and just loves what he is doing which is always great to see.

CON
It is pricer when you compare it to other juice places but I always say you get what you pay. I do wish he added more guava to my drink since I really enjoy that sweet flavor of guava -- but I think if I asked he probably would have. 

I will def. give it another try and perhaps just be more specific about how i'd like my drink. They did have some really neat flavor combos like basil and pear!",2

The food is creative, and tastes great. The plating is like a work of art. The service has been on point every time I have visited. 

I loved the game you can play in the bar area. (If you are sitting in the dining room area you might not know about this) There are cards at each table that have dares on them. You use them to be social with other players in the bar area. ( hence the name Libertine SOCIAL) It's a fun way to meet new people.

Everyone liked what they had, though nothing was tremendous.  The wait staff was very nice and moved our table when to an outer table that wasn't as noisy as where we had initially sat.

I am on a diet but I thought I needed more, so I then ordered the bread board, expecting small bites of various bread with cultured butter and olive oil. I was shocked again, this time the portion is so damn big that would ruin my diet plan completely. The prizing was funny, too. The $9 Ravioli was one fifth the portion of the $7 breads. The most expansive item I had there was a tiny little Swiss roll. They don't have a actual desert menu, instead the waiter would tell you the current desert items. I shouldn't have got the desert if I knew the prize, I could save some money and calories. 
Nevertheless, the food were very tasty, especially the Ravioli in brodo, the broth was really special, a mixture of light, delicate taste and hot, spicy touch. I suggest you to have dinner somewhere else and get this dish as snack. The breads were also good, but a bit greasy to me, even without the dipping sides. The Swiss roll was also good, although pricey. 
In total, this is a good restaurant where the food are extraordinary around the area, although a pretty strange place in the sense of pricing and orientation.",2

18422,1,1548374400000,"Is there an honest car mechanic out there? Not sure you will find one at Brake Masters on Cave Creek in Phoenix. In early July my car was bucking or hesitating so I brought it to Brake Masters because I had just had an oil change done there a few days previous. They performed a diagnostic test in which they found cylinder 6 misfiring and to fix this suggested a fuel injection service. So I paid $119.99 plus tax $136.31 out the door. Tech reported PCM update did not take and Dave recommended bringing it to dealership. Which I did. I paid dealership $200  and car is still bucking/hesitating. So, I bring it back to Brake Masters. Now cylinder 6 ignition coil was found to be bad. But wasn't that what the diagnostic test showed in early July. On July 20, 2016,  I paid  $231.54 to have cylinder 6 ignition coil replaced. After this repair car was still hesitating AND it smelled like fuel in the car so I brought it back another time. This time for no charge he put in something to clean the fuel and recommended a $800 repair to replace the fuel injection system. When I complained that the car seems worse than it was before any repairs, he offered to put the $200 I spent on coil repair toward injection system repair. He said he wasn't surprised at the fuel smell and explained it somehow in mechanic lingo. At this point I brought it to a neighborhood mechanic because I am feeling I am falling down an expensive rabbit hole. My mechanic found that ignition coil 6 was bad and had to replace it along with a spark plug. He also noted that ignition coil #2 looked newer than all the others which are original parts. Now the car is not hesitating or bucking and NO fuel smell. Yay! Then I headed over to Brake Masters. If Brake Masters would have done repair correctly I would not have had to spend so much time and money on this. I showed Dave the receipts, parts and Dave said he could only give back half of my money. I will have to go back in AGAIN tomorrow morning to speak with Mike because he is the only one authorized to issue a credit for the full amount. Either the repair was done incorrectly or dishonestly with the intent of me spending even more money. I will go back in tomorrow and then decide if there is an honest mechanic at Brake Masters on Cave Creek in Phoenix. I will update this post soon...",2

Highlights included the fried green tomatoes and the bacon-wrapped dates. The real showstoppers were the paellas. We opted to try the more traditional signature paella with seafood, chorizo and chicken, which was exactly what we were hoping for. The second paella was a little more unique, and had escargot, snow peas and was topped with a half rabbit that was slow-roasted until perfectly tender.

One of my recent food cravings is Dukboki- I havent really looked around for other places that offer it, but this is where I go for it. Im seriously just happy to know a place that has it..Its good enough to satisfy my craving so Im happy. 

On my most recent visit (this review), we got dukboki, Spareribs, and a spicy chicken (cant remember the exact name!). Everything was incredible for me. The only issue I had that that the sparerib meat was a little inconsistent. Some pieces were tough while others were really tender. Im not a butcher or anything, but im not inclined to believe there is any reason for this other than the meat not being cooked enough. Feel free to somehow correct me if I am wrong!

The spicy levels are tolerable here. Im not sure if they toned it down for me or anything, but it was definitely not death-level spicy like Ive had at other Korean restaurants. Maybe of you like it that way you should ask them to make it ""really spicy"". Just a thought.",2

The corned hash was okay.  Served with two eggs and potatoes mixed in with the corned hash.  I personally thought it was a tad bit too salty.

We also had escargots for appetizer.  Served with puff pastries,  they were delicious! Buttery, warm puff pastries which absorbed the garlicky butter sauce the escargots were cooked in.  I will have to say, add more garlic please!

Our waitress was pretty attentive.  She kept refilling our waters, which was great.  However, it took forever to get bread, which she never noticed we didn't get!

When you arrive, they scan your ID and provide you with your membership card. You walk down a long brick corridor which gives you more of a secret speakeasy feel. They serve the best drinks I've had in charlotte so far. For a good drink I used to only go to the punch room at the ritz Carlton but Dot Dot Dot is definitely strong competition. The drinks taste amazing but be careful, they are very strong. You will want to pace yourself for sure. 

The food taste good but don't come hungry. The portions are small so if you're expecting to fill up, you'll need to order many items before feeling satisfied. Their small plates are full of flavor so if you just need a snack it's a nice treat.

The only area I hope improves soon is the noise level. It was next level loud. I'm not sure if it was the other guest or the music but if you're looking for quiet and intimate, make sure you go during a time/day the place is empty. Otherwise the noise level is at a 10.

18462,1,1548892800000,"Haven't been here for a while because of past bad experiences. First time I went there the burger/fries were decent. Next time the burger was good but the fries were gritty, as if they hadn't been washed properly before frying. Next time the fries were great but the burger was very greasy, like if the grill wasn't hot enough or needed cleaning. So I've been bypassing 5 Guys for a year or two, but after hiking the Metro Parks last Saturday I decided to give them another try.

No one was in line when I entered, but by the time I finished ordering there were about five people behind me, so lines form fast. Wait wasn't too long as my burger was custom prepared. I got the single patty cheeseburger ($4.99) plus small fries ($2.49). Approaching $7.50, I expected my meal to be a large step up over other fast burger joints. Sorry to say, it wasn't.

The fries were great. Hot, just enough salt, and just enough grease. But really, it's not that difficult to prepare great fries if starting with decent potatoes, a properly hot deep fryer and the proper cooking time. And for $2.49 they were not overpriced for the amount you get. If rating fries alone, they would get a very high score.

The burger was where I was disappointed. The meat was a step up over almost all other fast food burger places and that's a plus. (I refuse to eat at McD's or Ralley's because of the awful quality of the meat.) Patty was probably a third pound, and it would have been good if it hadn't been stretched out to fill a rather large bun. Flattening the meat allows it to be cooked faster but usually causes it to be overcooked. And mine was. Not juicy. No flavor. Tasteless. I like the extras available to choose from, but the beef should be the centerpiece of the burger. For the price, unless you are in a hurry or don't want to ""sit down,"" there are too many other good places to have a really good burger. Perhaps I'll try them again in a few years. Next time I am in the area and in need of food I will probably go across the street and, for less money, eat at Chipotle.",2

For appetizer, we got the rolled onion pancakes with sliced beef. I think it is a well put together, fresh dish.
For main course, I ordered the spicy braised beef noodle soup. Just the perfect amount of spicy. The broth was rich and dark with deep undertones of the beef. The beef was so tender that it just pulled apart. The noodles were soft with just the right amount of texture and chew. We also got an order of pork soup dumplings. These things were little pockets of flavor in your mouth. 

For dessert, we really wanted bubble tea. But because they had run out of boba, we got to pick one other filling from the list. I got taro milk tea with caramel pudding. My boyfriend got taro milk tea with mango pudding. They were both pretty good. 

Will definitely make a return to Everyday, someday (;",2

I had the breakfast burrito with chorizo and chicken. I replaced the iceberg lettuce with spinach. It was delicious, especially with the mild salsa they brought out with the dish. 

They made the substitution no problem.

We ordered big , every inch of surface space on our table was covered with food. We had everything from green tea, to beef and green onion pancakes and sweet egg yolk steam bun and it was all very very very tasty.  Squirrel Hill for me is a neighborhood seldom visited but when I do make the 40 minute bus trek I always find a hidden gem or new development. 


My two gripes and I will try to keep them  short, my boyfriend's Taiwanese style pork belly slider and our beef and green onion pancakes were COLD burrr, chilly not warm at all and the waiter was a tad to brisk with his intro , snatching the menu away from us before we were fully done examining it.

This Godfathers Pizza is attached to Love's Travel Stop. There is a separate entrance at the front or you can enter through the convenient store. The inside is clean and they have plenty of seating. You can order specialty pizzas or create your own. The ""mini"" pizzas are baked, packaged and ready for sale. I was skeptical at first, but they looked fresh and not like they had been sitting there long. The regular size pizzas are made fresh to order so you can always call them ahead of time and place your order so it's ready when you arrive. This is pretty convenient for anyone who is looking to pick up a quick dinner on the way back into town since there aren't many options in the area. This visit I had a ""Cheese Pizza"" (mini) that was priced at $3.49 before tax. I was happy with the price considering this is a known chain and it is hooked to a gas station, so I thought the prices would be higher. My pizza was hot, fresh and tasted better than average. You have to pay for your food at the Godfathers or Subway registers inside their area, you cannot take the food into the convenient store and pay for it there. They also have calzones, wings and cinnamon streusel for dessert.",2

We got our drinks promptly, and we also had an appetizer comped. The food came out hot, and was very good. She came by repeatedly to check in on us, and we never went without.

18588,2,1547424000000,"First time visiting a Somalian restaurant. After seeing photos of the Mushkaki fries I knew I had to try it. There is an option to order it with more sauce for an additional dollar however I would argue that it's not necessary at all. It was delicious and every fry was nicely coated in sauce, however next time I would probably ask for a little less sauce as over time the fries got a little soggy. The flavour was fantastic but a little strong.. If I could describe it I would say think along the lines of Buffalo sauce.. the tangy-ness is quite similar. I found myself having to steal some of my boyfriends salad and rice as a refresher for my palate. 

We also ordered the spicy chicken plate which came with a side of rice and salad. The rice was very good and nicely seasoned. The salad and chicken were mediocre and the flavours of the two were not at all unique. The chicken, both flavour and appearance kind of reminded me of sweet and sour chicken. The portion sizes and price were fantastic!

Good Morning, 
 I am writing to you our of great disappointment. Cantina 1511 has always been one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte since it's opening. I have since moved out of town.l However last night I met and old friend at your Park Rd location and had some of the worst service I have experienced. Our server's name was Michelle, she had red hair. We arrived for our meal around 6:10 pm and were seated outside. Michelle stopped by the table and said she would be right with us - after five or so minutes she brought us our waters and we ordered some beers. It took 10 minutes for our beers to arrive and then she walked away to help another table before even offering to take our order. After an additional 10 minutes she did come back to take our orders. I got some vegetarian tacos (so not meat to cook) Queso, and my friend ordered the Crab and Goat Cheese Croquettes ( a simple fried appetizer). We proceeded to wait 45 minutes for our dinner while the three tables that were seated after us got their meals. When we inquired about our meal we were told and I quote: ""The croquettes have mashed potatoes in them so that takes a long time."" Seriously - they are fried. So we finally get our food, and my vegetarian tacos come with the charro beans that have meat in them - so I didn't eat them and I didn't bother saying anything because we had already been there for over an hour. Then after we ate we waited about 20 minute for our waitress to stop avoiding us and bring us the tab. She would look right at us, and then go stop at another table, my friend finally went inside to find her and asked her to please bring our check. So in total we were at your establishment for almost 2 hours. I try not to complain, but I am just so disappointed. I understand that you establishment was busy, but this was unacceptable service.",2
18633,3,1548115200000,"Got pizza here before for my first time, just a standard large cheese and pepperoni.  While the pizza was excellent, their billing practice needs tweaked.  When I saw the total on the register, I pulled out my debit card and suddenly the total went a little higher after the guy saw my card... Much higher than just tax.  There was an unadvertised fee for using a card that they try to slip in when you aren't looking.  Not a good thing to pull on your customers, haven't been back since.",2
18634,1,1546300800000,"Have eaten here three times, last time was a phoned In Carryout.  Dining in the food was excellent and large portions. Oxtail fried rice was delicious , steaming hot and fresh with an over easy fried egg on top.  The spring rolls are also a great appetizer 2 rolls cut in half for 4 total pieces a good value appetizer for $5.99.  Enjoyed several wings next visit during their happy hour along with some tasty beers. Sat at the bar late night, very friendly male bartender and did a great job with our group of four.  Third visit was a phoned in Carryout. Must say I was disappointed.  Portions were smaller than the portions when I had dined in with the fried rice and especially the garlic vegetable blend.  When I opened the to go container, I thought it was a joke, barely half full with veggies . For $11 at a local place like this I find it unacceptable. At Joel Robuchon I would expect it, not here!  I almost wanted to drive back and question the portion,  don't have time for that. Previous two dine in visits were great that's why I had returned.  Come on District One , veggies are the cheapest , in your unfair portion it would have cost me $22 if not more to fill a to go box with sautéed veggies :(   please see photo I posted

BEER options are rather good, something for everyone. (Note - this is not a ""craft"" beer pub) I love that they have Maisel's Weisse on tap - you don't see it too much in the city (I personally consume kegs of this stuff when in Germany). You get all the irish pub taps, one rotating local craft tap, a house selection, a couple Mill Street choices and some bigger international brands. 

SERVICE has been excellent on all my visits. Very friendly staff who always know when your ready for the next pint. Very consistent - I guess not being super busy helps on this front.

ATMOSPHERE & DECOR - Somewhat dated for sure. This is defiantly not the latest trendy pub!!!!! It feels / looks like an old style pub, but not dirty. I like the couch seating. They have a pool table room in the back. The bar is also very dark.

MIXED clientele for sure - everyone from students, suits, tourists, the elderly and many folks enjoying a beer on their own at the bar.

FOOD is standard pub selections. Never tried it myself but from what I can see, would probably be 2-3 star at best. Come for the beer & quiet time.

Conclusion - I like it (visited three times in the last two weeks). A perfect place to unwind after a crazy day at work. Not for the hipsters, trend setters or decor lovers (and that's OK with me).

Salmon tartare was amazing! The waffle fries are some of the best that I've ever had. Nice and crispy and NOT thick, they were like chips.

We came and sat as the first two at the communal table, which we sat at alone and empty for about 20 minutes before it filled up. Naturally this is not the restaurants' fault, however the waitress who was also serving filled-up adjacent table, took a good 10 minutes to even acknowledge us and ask for our drinks. She came back immediate asking for our menu items as if to start the process, but then seated the remainder of the table and started the process all over again. Oh well.

The when soup and salad came as an appetizers, my friend ask specifically for no salad dressing which naturally was ignored. Meh. The chef came to cook he tried his best to do the over-the-top presentation that is expected of Hibachi, but seemed, personality wise, to either be new at it or awkward. He didn't engage with anybody until he did a party trick and then reverted back into his shell. Poor kid as he had a very heavy accent. 

This locations gives you half noodle and half rice rather than just rice, which was interested/a nice change, but the quality/proportion of them was all off. The fried rice needed another half an egg, the noodles were half crispy half not, the vegetables was practically all onion [sigh - no broccoli] and dude, what did they do with the yum yum and teriyaki sauces? somebody needs to revisit their recipe or at least buy the good brand because it was practically just mayo with some coloring.

Parking in 4th Ward isnt the easiest. However, we were able to find a spot on the street relatively close. Alexander Michael's is an adorable house in 4th Ward. Please make sure to read the back of the menu for the story about this place! 

The wait was about 45 minutes and the place was standing room only at the time. However, we were able to grab some drinks at the bar. They had Triple C Baby Maker on tap, so I was a happy girl! Lots of local brews!

We started with the fried pickles as we looked over the menu. Delicious ranch. For our meals, I convinced my Dad to order the What Is It, because I have had it before and loved it! I knew it would be right up his alley. He finished the whole thing and really enjoyed his meal. I had a bite and it was just as good as I remembered. I ordered the black bean burger with a cup of crap soup. The soup is absolutely amazing!!! Chunks of crab. This is a must order item every time. The black bean patty was nicely done and i liked that it was served on a pita, instead of a bun. Both my husband and mom ordered the chicken sandwich and enjoyed their meals. 

Service at the table was just ok. To be quite honest, it felt fairly rushed, which is a bit annoying when you wait 45 minutes. However, the guy taking names down for the wait was fantastic.

18752,3,1547251200000,"Until two years ago, I dropped into different yoga studios to work on different areas, hoping to get some increased flexibility.  I started at a bikram studio, of which I quickly grew bored due to the lack of variety.  I recently came to yoga 103 and purchased three or four punch passes in a row.  I enjoyed my experiences and felt that the instructors were really helping me progress.  I eventually purchased a membership and I always look forward to attending class on a weekly basis.  There is a class, as well as an instructor, that will appeal to everyone.  If you don't find it your first time, keep looking because it's there.  Beware that some classes are more challenging than others and I'd call in advance to get a recommendation.  Overall, this is the best yoga studio in the city (in my opinion).  The instructors work hard to push the students and are very approachable.  Regarding the price, this studio is not cheap, but like all things, you get what you pay for.  I've attending yoga classes at my local gym and it is not in the same ballpark.  Yoga 103 is clean and the team does a great job to give you the experience you came for.  

For your first, class, I recommend the candlelight with Eva, Lena, Lauren , Nicole or Ashley.  You can't go wrong.  ENJOY!",3

I came to this location a few months back, and was met with everything but a smile and friendly attitude.  Unfortunately, this had happened again on 7/9/2017 at approximately 6:30PM. Their is one girl in particular that we have encountered on both occasions, and she will intentionally do the opposite of what you ask for one reason or another (evidently as a result of her being employed) as you can present with the softest approach but this then translates to her as hate; ruining the entire experience. The first experience had happened mid day around 1:00PM. I made the mistake of not getting her name, but given that she has remained employed for several months, i would assume the establishment is well aware of her existence. I will however offer a description, she has red hair with tattoos on her arm. Ill continue to go to cafe rio, but will surely opt to travel to the nearest other location on happy valley. Good Luck, invest in management who can keep an eye out for this type of behavior on shift. If this girl is the manager, re-assess you hiring and training process, because this girl does not know the foundation of quality service.  many other details contributed to the need to write this post, but i will summarize it with the above.",2

They ask me what I would like to drink and I tell them a Large Dr.Pepper. They advise me they're out of all coke products, so I ask for a ice coffee. When I pull up they tell me my total which had an extra charge for adding a ice coffee. That already upset me because I had to pay for the meal which includes the drink but had to pay an extra 1.49 to get the ice coffee. Whatever I let that go. Than I pull up to the window and the woman ask me what I order..... I told her a sandwich... She looks at me and says welll what kind of sandwich I tell her what it was. Than she closes the window without saying anything. I mean I feel like I've been to McDonald's enough to know they should have my order on their screen. When she comes back she hands me just a sandwich and closes the window. LOL so I wait for the rest of my order. A guy comes to the window I tell him that I'm missing my hash brown and my ice coffee and hand him the receipt. He looks at the receipt and closes the window. Again without saying anything to me. While the window was closed I look at my sandwich and my muffin is burnt. A little burnt is okay and I'm not picky but this muffin was burnt and hard! So when he comes back to the window he hands me a large vanilla ice coffee. The ice coffee looks like it has no ice. I tell him my sandwich is burnt and he asks me to pull up to the parking spot and takes the sandwich. As I pull up I take a drink of the ice coffee which I notice there is ice in the cup it just feels like it's very small as if it had melted. When i take a drink it taste like it had been sitting out and the ice had melted. I was so upset at this point. So I go inside and tell the cashier she was the only one that smiled the whole time at me as well. She made me another ice coffee and it was great! Than I tell her hey I'm also waiting for my sandwich and that I was in the drive thru and my sandwich was burnt. She's like okay well did they tell you to pull forward. I was like yes they did but I'm going to wait in here tell it's done. I waited like 10 minutes seeing people order and get their food. I went up to another cashier and told her I've been waiting a while now and I still haven't gotten my sandwich. She tells her supervisor and than 2 minutes later here is my sandwich. By the time I went to my car my hash brown is now cold and I'm even more upset. What makes me really angry about it is that not one person apologized for anything. Not one. Not even the manager. Now I understand we all make mistakes and things happen. But I have never had such horrible service with such disrespect for customers ever.",2
18761,2,1547164800000,"And my tour of the C-list shows continues. I know there are some people that really dig the musical impersonators. I'm just not one of them unless they're doing Pink Floyd or Rush since the band has to be pretty awesome to get that stuff down. 

Overall I would rather see a great cover band than impersonators for pop stuff (Zowie Bowie?). My order of the performers from top to bottom. 

1. Elvis: The guy was as good as any other Elvis impersonator I've seen and he lead off the show. Everything you would expect.

2. Michael Jackson: He had the moves. He sang the songs pretty well but why do tunes like ""They Don't Care About Us"" when there are SOO many other hits that could've taken up that time. The Thriller part was pretty good/funny. 

They also ended the show by singing ""Heal the World"" and each of the singers did a verse which was so Disneyesque (puke). 

3. Charlie Daniels: At least this guy played the violin and did a smoking version of ""Devil Went to Georgia"". 

4. Carrie Underwood: She was a decent singer but I wouldn't say she was an impersonator. Didn't look or sound like her. Plus she did 2 GN'R songs for some reason. 

5. Lady Gaga: I felt like this was a bad Halloween drag show. The homemade costumes were funny in a good way but she didn't sound anywhere close to Gaga.

The band was pretty good. They were able to seamlessly transition from genre to genre really well.",2

18762,3,1547510400000,"I frequent Harris Grill quite often. Whenever we need a place in walking distance I always pick them over all the other high priced or mediocre Shadyside restaurant/bars. Their menu changes seasonally and is always hilarious (more so than Mad Mex, which they poke fun at along with other local restaurants). They're surprisingly vegetarian friendly for the amount of meat they have on their menu. I have not had anything here that wasn't delicious; favorites will come and go, but I'm a fan of their HUGE salads and the eggplant lasagna (noodle free). 

Absolutely go for brunch - Sundays 10 to 2. It will either be a buffet or a menu for a fixed price of $13. VERY meat heavy, but I'm sure there is always something veggie-friendly, but never expect vegan-friendly. They include two drinks and a fresh fruit plate - one of the drinks can be a bloody mary (which we got and regretted, it was very unpalatable) or a frozen mimosa (get that instead). 

What I really love, aside from the fantastic food, is the creative cocktails. These drinks are going to be on the $8.50 side, some are worth it and some aren't, but The $3 Frozen Cosmo happy hour is the best deal on Ellsworth. Even if you're a manly man, this very pink booze slushie is amazing. Go with a big group and ask for the lounge upstairs or a window booth. Service is usually either chipper and delightful or just barely okay. We don't come here for the service or the dim lights - we go for a good meal and you should too.",3

18812,3,1548115200000,"So sad to be writing this because, we do like going to Chili's... just not at this location. My husband and I decided to stop by at this Chili's yesterday for lunch. The hostess was very nice and sat us down right away. Waited for a few minutes for our waitress. She took our drink orders, water for me and a Dos XX for my hubby with a lime. We also ordered the nachos, jalapenos and pico de gallo on the side. She didn't write it down and my husband said, our order was going to be wrong (I hate when he's right). She finally came back with our drinks, maybe 5 small ice cubes in each water glass (no joke) and a nice warm beer with no lime to go with it. My husband was going to ask for a new beer, but she never stopped by until the nachos arrived. Hubby was right, jalapenos were on the nachos and she said she told them jalapenos on the side. Now, she could have done 2 things, she could have told us what happened  before bringing them out and ask us if we still wanted them or she could have said, ""I saw that there were jalapenos on them so, I asked them to make a new one.""  Did not do either one. Food arrived, she didn't ask if we wanted more drinks, we had to ask for them.

The restaurant was also disgustingly dirty. Tables that weren't cleaned from prior guests, floors filled with food and crap. It wasn't even that busy. The sad part was, the nice hostess was the one cleaning the tables, sweeping the floor, re-arranging the tables, AND seating people. All this time, she still had a smile on her face. We decided to tip the hostess since she was actually pleasant and was going above and beyond to keep the restaurant presentable. At some point, I'm sure we saw the manager attempting to clean a table, but we noticed he left it for someone else to clean up. Will never go back to this location.

The atmosphere and decor is really awesome: like rustic/industrial meets Tulum Mexico.  Not that over the top typical ""Mexican restaurant"" atmosphere with the colorful wooden chairs that's sooo overdone. 

Another reason this restaurant is one of our favs is the size. We can typically get in no problem because there is so much seating. That's really nice, especially on a Friday night when you realize you forgot to make reservations. 

We also bring our pup and eat on their patio pretty often in the summer. We love their Sunday brunch.

I love Indian food because it can offer some of the most delicious guiltless meat-free meal options (which carnivores like myself often appreciate), which is why I was shocked at the overwhelmingly meat-based entrees here. My old favorites like palak paneer or malai kofta were replaced by seabass or duck-confit. I was so thrown off that I actually checked to make sure that I indeed entered the correct restaurant. It is nice to see modern interpretations of Indian food, but I was not prepared to drop $20+ on unfamiliar dishes using ingredients that I have never seen in Indian restaurants before. Perhaps they should consider expanding the more 'traditional' menu items. 

I ended up getting the samosas, garlic naan, and tikki masala (as I do not eat seafood, which eliminates a chunk of the menu). The portions made be feel like a child again, due to their size. I left hungry and still craving Indian food, and a little cheated. I was even more perplexed at how I paid nearly $30 for the pleasure of that experience. I do not see Copper in my future.",2

In case you are wondering what a sparkling ice capade is, it's sherbert blended with sprite and the end result tastes like a push pop shake!

As for the location, it's in a perfect area as you are right in the middle of Scottsdale; where you're walking distance from the mall, restaurants, bars, parks and local shops.  Scottsdale Stadium is the reason why people fly down to Arizona to catch a bunch of preseason games that don't mean anything in the standings..; because the location and the ballpark makes the whole Spring Training experience so much fun, with the numerous accommodations for their fans!

The parking was easy at dinner time, staff was friendly enough, the service was quick and accurate. The price for shrimp and steak hibachi with double fried rice, no veggie, 1 generous portion of shrimp sauce, and a drink was $11, which I thought was fair. I have a big appetite and the portion size certainly filled me up. It was a lot of food for a fair price. 

The food was good. It was not amazingly fresh like a ""real"" hibachi restaurant, but I was satisfied with the quality of the steak, and the shrimp was surprisingly DELICIOUS. Rice was good. Shrimp sauce good. But, I do not like a lot of flavor in my food, so I enjoyed the relative blandness. It's probably not good for someone with more adventurous tastes! 

The cook/cashier allowed my substitution no problem/no charge because he said he wants to make the customer happy. The ambiance of the restaurant is appropriate for the food, maybe even nicer than I expected. Nice enough to look at while you eat but it's definitely casual enough to wear whatever. They had a decent amount of seating, tables and booths, but it would maybe be hard to find a table at a busy lunch time. Silverware was plastic, napkins cheap, little packets of extra soy sauce available. 

I wouldn't probably take a guest here for a lunch date, but it's good enough for takeout for me when I have that craving and don't want to spend $35 and two hours waiting for it. I just think people who gave this 1 star have absurd expectations for a hibachi express place! 

There is one TV, password-protected wifi, and restrooms as well. 

Major Cons: When I went to fill my soda (Pepsi fountain drinks if you're curious, free refills), the Pepsi was out and running completely clear carbonation.

18967,2,1547078400000,"I had my second Choolaah experience this weekend and though there were some frustrating moments, I will still be going back. 

First off the frustrations: We went Sunday afternoon for a late lunch (1:30ish). The line was long and there were a limited numbers of cashiers. We waited in line a good 15 minutes to order. We both agreed that we would use order ahead on our next visit. 

Now here is where my frustration is mixed. Part of the reason the line was moving so slow is that cashiers were guiding customers through the menu in such excruciating depth that orders were taking multiple minutes to put in. One cashier actually brought samples of each masala to a group of four so they could taste before ordering. While I appreciate the commitment to customer service and satisfaction, this was frustrating to watch. I would rather see samples be given in a separate location so customers can make informed decisions before standing in line. 

Now for the actual food: On my first visit I got the Perfect Balance bowl with Tikka and Lamb. It was exceptional. The lamb was perfectly cooked and the sauce was the perfect pairing. On my most recent visit I ordered the Choolaah salad with Salmon. I wouldn't normally order salmon at a fast casual restaurant, but the strength of my first visit encouraged something out of the ordinary. It was quite good, though not as a good as the Perfect Balance. (Note that this is probably due to the fact that I rarely, if ever, feel fully satisfied after a fish meal.)

Overall Choolaah is great. Its ordering system is a little slow (definitely consider ordering ahead!), but that can be worked out.",2

They make the best smoothies in the world to me. When I was in Seattle for 2wks I was a Jamba Juice. When I found out there was on in Madison, WI. I found reasons to drive 2hrs to go to Madison. When I had leave Charlotte and go back to WI for work the only thing that made my return trip back good was going to the Jamba Juice in the airport. So I'm so happy that there's a Jamba Juice that doesn't require me to have an airline ticket. Thank you BOA for putting a Jamba Juice in your building.

Kind of expensive. As is everything in this area (an area of no choice).

I really liked it at first. Still the best place here I think (near cityplace). 
It is kind of hit and miss though. 

The staff is nice and the quality, when it is good - is quite good.

It should be great though, when it is 45-50 for 2 people, and for
protein-conscious people, even more.

18986,1,1547683200000,"I just starting coming here recently and I really like it. I don't even think about Subway anymore when I want a sandwich for lunch. Lines(at least at this location) have never been an issue so it's VERY fast. Their bread is awesome. First time I had a hot dagwood(turkey, ham, corned beef) on everything bread. I can't say the everything bread contributed any to the sandwich though. I got a medium and finished the whole thing with no problem. Second time around I think I found my sandwich. I got a LARGE turkey, ham and roast beef(essentially a ""club"" but that must be too quick to say) on the sesame bread. Ordered cold with swiss cheese and their oil & vinegar dressing, the sandwich was freaking delicious. The meat combo was just right for me and the swiss cheese was nice and thickly sliced. I saw the oil dressing and the herbs it had in it but I can't say I really tasted it. The nice thing was that it didn't seem to make the bread soggy(like at Subway) which was great because I only needed half of the large sandwich to fill me up. So while a large sandwich is a but pricey at ~$8.50 it provided a filling and delicious lunch AND dinner so I can't complain.

I will also address the ubiquitous Cleveland sandiwch comparison with Dave's Cosmic Subs. I like Dave's a lot too. Their bread is a different style but equally good. Dave's bread is lighter but it has a very thin crispy crust which I appreciate. DiBella's bread is denser and has a glossy chewy exterior like that of a pretzel. I'm also in love with Dave's Cosmic Sauce! The problem here is that your money goes a lot farther at DiBella's than at Dave's. For almost $7 you get a sandwich at Dave's that is probably 7-9"" and is fairly light. Both times I've been there I have still been hungry after enjoying my sub. At DiBella's you can get a medium sub for around $7 that is at least 12'. has denser bread and more meat. Cough up and extra $2 for a large and you've got a meal for 2. So as far as getting the most bang for your buck, DiBella's wins.",2
18991,1,1548115200000,Been to a lot of escape rooms and this has to be the worst. We did the locksmith room and it is like being in a bathroom.  The clues made no sense and it was a complete disappointment,2
18993,3,1547337600000,"I was pretty disappointed in the buffet at TI.  I wasn't expecting gourmet, but I was definitely expecting better than I received.  Just like any other Vegas buffet, there was a line but it wasn't too long (maybe that should have been a clue..).  The place is nicely laid out and there was plenty of seating (another sign).

When I go to a buffet, I just don't start grabbing food.  I like to cruise the entire buffet to see what my choices are so then I know how to handle portion control.  And I never start eating without checking out the dessert section so I know how much room to save.  Needless to say, I was disappointed in the dessert options so that almost immediately ruined the whole buffet for me.  Luckily I wasn't paying so that managed to keep me open minded enough to eat.  The food should at least look freshly prepared but much of what I saw looked like it sat under the heat lamps for most of the night, and it wasn't even that late yet.

It'll fill you up and the price isn't ridiculous, but I prefer the buffet at Bellagio.  Unless someone else is paying, I probably won't return.",2
18994,3,1547424000000,I can't even give this place a proper review because when I came here with my friends they sat us down with the menus and literally ignored us for 40 minutes. We weren't even able to put an order in. We kept on trying to get the attention of the servers walking around but I don't know if they just pretended not to see or they were actually paying that little attention to their guests. It wasn't even that busy. There were only a couple other tables in our area. There were groups of people that came in after us and got their orders taken and drinks served while we were just sitting there waiting for them. Like I work in a restaurant too so it's just mind blowing that you could ignore a table in your section so hard that they sit there for 40 minutes waiting to order. Like if it took 40 minutes for the food to come I could understand that more. But just to take our orders???? We ended up leaving because we were staving and didn't want to wait any longer and just went to get pizza from pizza pizza.,1
19016,1,1547769600000,"I haven't eaten here NEARLY as much as I would like.  But the times I have have all been amazing.  

Stranded in midwood one night soon after soul's opening, I met up with some friends who were going there for dinner.  Since my only other choice was to sit alone at common market, I followed them, and I was not sorry.  I had one of their sushi rolls...which roll it was is lost in the mist of time and many killed brain cells.  I do remember that it was a little spicy, a little creamy, a little crunchy, and I DEVOURED it.  

I wasn't able to return until almost 4 years later, but I watched the twitter feed and my mouth watered at every special they posted.  Finally I was able to go there for brunch.  We shared the truffle fries which were amazing.  I don't know if they come with a dipping sauce, but we didn't get one, and we didn't need one.  I had the chicken and waffles and I once again devoured every bit.  It was also very reasonably priced for the amount of food.  I got a mimosa but I wish I had gotten a bloody mary because my friend's was delicious and came with all sorts of pickled goodies.  

Oh, also, they put a cucumber slice in the water, which is like a double boost of hydration for those of us who may or may not be - ahem - dehydrated from the night before.  Soul, I love you!!!",2

Keep in mind, it is a quasi sports bar - combined with nightly food and drink specials, makes for a busy place.   They have done a good job remodeling, but even with the open side seating area, there is usually a wait.

My family and I have been doing Thursday night $5 burger night.   It's five bucks, build your own burger.   Choice of side.   Their fries rock, extra crispy and very good.    My family usually gets the burg with bacon, avocado, sautéed onions and cheddar cheese.  You cannot beat it!!!!!!  What has really frost my ass, they used to have $3.50 local draft on Thursday, that was a rocking deal, but no more...... sniff sniff.

So, other misc. comments.   Wings are decent, above average.  Nachos rock, I think they use real velvetta, its nice and creamy, yum yum.   HINT - they ran a Yelp Check In offer for a free app last year.   It came up last week when I checked in....... Saweet.   Seared Tuna app is small, but really great.

5 star for local craft beer, rotating taps.   Yum Yum.  Dilly dilly.  Cheers.

So I called Mirage and scheduled an appointment for them to come out and give me a quote.

She told me she'd email me a quote to sign and fax back, and as soon as she got it she'd call me for a deposit, and that once she got my deposit she could then order the glass. So I waited for the email but it never came. 
The next day it finally arrived so I printed it, signed it, and faxed it back. But Kara never called me to get my deposit. Finally I called her and asked if she'd received the signed quote, and she said yes, but she hadn't had time to call me. 
I asked if she wanted me to call her later and she said no, she was out in the warehouse with the guys and would call me later when she got back in the office.
But she never called me.
A few days later we called and someone else answered, so we left a request for the owner to call us, but he never did. In fact, no one ever called us back.
We assumed they didn't want our business, so we hired another company.

It's a simple door that I've probably passed a few times without thinking twice. The reason I mention all of that is because the interior is deceptively huge! It's got a pretty large bar area and even a nice lounge area in the back. You'd never know it from the outside.

But in the end, it's just a bar. It provides a decent option if you want a drink after eating at a nearby restaurant (Mr Tofu, Hot n Juicy, Fukuburger across the street, etc). When we were in there, they had a Jäger shot menu, from which we all ordered a Surfer On Acid. After that, a few of us had some Gin and Tonics. The Surfer On Acid was OK, but the Gin and Tonic was bitter and not all that enjoyable.

The plus about the casino floor (and most of the casinos in downtown-old Vegas) is that the blackjack tables still have a low minimum on weekends.  The rooms were smelly and the bathrooms were tiny.

I had the Reuben. It's a decadent sandwich done just how I like it. The potato salad (did I say potato) is killer. The mustard in the potato salad takes it over the top (reminds me of a good Southern style potato salad).

I ordered the passion fruit lemonade which was way too sweet for my tastes, and the Benihana Excellence. My dining partner got the Lunch Sea Scallops. Both of our meals came with a ""salad"" and mine came with soup. These were incredibly disappointing and looked like something from a really cheap buffet. The salad was drenched in an unappetizing dressing and the soup tasted like salted hot water. Luckily the rest of the meal was a lot more enjoyable. The scallops came with fried rice; the scallops were great (especially for the rice) and the rice was good, although a bit on the salty side. My shrimp, and vegetables were really good and the teriyaki beef was good but it was drenched in too much sauce for me. I personally thought the food tasted better without any of their dipping sauces. At the end of the meal they gave me ice cream with a candle on it and sang happy birthday. They also took a photo of us and printed it out and put it in a little paper frame. 

I definitely recommend signing up for the birthday special because it is a great deal. Also, of it's your first time go for lunch because they have a lot of reasonable lunch entrees. Not sure if I would be as pleased with the experience if I had to pay $50 for it; but for $20 it was fantastic.",2

I just went to eat the left overs only to find a HUGE piece of meat - beef, lamb? its brown..and some other meat rice dish mixed into my veg left overs. This over-site is really unfortunate. I called to complain and the apology seemed very insincere.  First I had to explain to a server the problem and he just totally didn't understand, then I was passed off to the manager. As a vegetarian it really is upsetting to have meat mixed into your food. I don't think this place understands this.

19117,2,1546300800000,"I'm so disappoint not only in the quality of the food but the service.  My daughter chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner and it was terrible from getting or drinks to the meal.  Two of my kids fell asleep at the table because we were waiting so long.  The manager came over and said desserts on him.  So before we left we got three cheesecakes to go and we went to go pay our bill and they included the cheesecakes on the bill.  Went to the front and talked with a different manager and explained the cheesecake was on the bill, he said this is the first I've heard of this but he would take it off.  What a horrible place that my daughter had to celebrate her 13 birthday!  Cheesecake Factory is definitely off our list!!!!!",1

I will most definitely be coming back! Prices are fair, however it is a small dining room and there's only 4 patio tables outside, all of which were occupied when I went. So prepare yourself to wait for people to leave and open a table or get your food to go.",2

Our waitress Missy was so funny, personable and really attentive. We will definitely be coming back. They have an awesome brunch menu with mimosas that I want to try out.
Also you can get a free guac if you sign up for their newsletter. Totally worth it.

EDIT: after coming here a second time I have to say, this may be the absolute best Taco place I have ever been to, even over Velvet Taco in Dallas, TX. Everything about this place is perfect. The trendy ambiance, the tacos, the drinks, the deals and specials. You absolutely must try it out!",2
19126,2,1548720000000,"Great! Very classy and smells great when you walk in. The room was spacious with a large, beautiful bathroom. The shower was huge and it had a whirlpool tub.

19129,2,1546473600000,"My friend and I dropped in here on Saturday for lunch. There was a game later that day, and the Pirates fans and tailgaters were already starting to descend upon the North Shore. I'm sure this place gets packed closer to game time!

We were primarily in search of a Bloody Mary, which BZ's fortunately offered. It wasn't the best Bloody I've ever had, but it wasn't bad. It definitely could have used more spice--pepper or horseradish or really anything to give it some kick. We remedied this issue ourselves with a ton of black pepper.

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. I expected the typical fried chicken breast, coated in buffalo sauce--instead, BZ's serves a grilled chicken breast with a thicker sauce slathered on top. The sauce did not taste like traditional wing sauce, but reminded me more of a spicy barbeque sauce. It wasn't bad, but as a die hard lover of wings and all things coated in buffalo sauce, this wasn't quite what I expected and I thought for a moment they had given me the wrong sandwich.

The fries were great, though! I love a good crispy french fry and these did not disappoint. 

Not a bad spot to grab a bite before a game or if you're just in the area and hungry--the location is prime (literally across the street from the stadium). I just wasn't blown away by the food.",2
19132,2,1547424000000,"I'm not a huge fan of burger joints. I've eaten probably a handful (if that) burgers in the last three years so when my sister told me she was craving a good burger, I was disappointed lol But to make her happy, I let her choose which led me here. I've heard good reviews about this place and my sister told me it's one of her top favorite burger spots in Vegas. 

I liked how the place is set up. There are booths as well as high tops and the theme of the place is inviting.

I ordered the Sin City burger as well as the Smash fries. It came out fairly quickly -- they bring it to your table which has all the condiments set up for you. 


The burger has smoked bacon, American cheese, grilled onions and haystack onions, fried egg with an Egg bun and their signature Smash sauce. I didn't get to experience the Egg bun because they ran out so I had to substitute it with a wheat bun. But nonetheless was it so good! I couldn't help stopping after every bite and telling my sister how delicious it is. And the garlic fries were also pretty good. 

For two Sin City specialty burgers, two Smash fries and two fountain drinks, the price was $22 which is definitely worth it. 

I can't wait to go back. No, seriously lol",2
19134,1,1548115200000,"I love seeing shows here! Hands down it's the best places to see a band in Phoenix. 

What's so great about Crescent? First, they have a lot of fantastic local and national acts that play here. It's big enough for a mid-sized national band, but it still feels intimate. Also, I'm way too old to stand for an entire concert if I don't have to, so I appreciate the bleacher seats in the back. I don't always use them, but it's nice to know I can.

As far as food and drinks go, Crescent is solid. They have a decent craft beer selection and the food is good. The menu is fairly simple, but what they have is tasty. The bartenders and servers have always been quick and attentive.

Also, on Sunday nights they do a decent trivia. It's pretty eclectic, but it's a good time. They give out pretty awesome prizes to the top 6 or so teams including various gift cards, random gift baskets (like a bacon-themed one), concert tickets and various kitchy items.

You would think you would pay a lot more than you do for the quality here. The place even has dance events! But it's the owners that make this place!

It's been almost six years that I've been in this neighborhood, and BuzzBerry/BeanBerry/Renegade has had an identity crisis from the start: Was it a smoothie place? No...there was no real fruit to be seen, just cartons of smoothie mix and ice. Was it a coffee place? No, they don't tamp their espresso. Wait. Maybe it is a bar - there are taps now! Ok, not a bar, the kegs are gone. Oh and now they are pushing their dinner specials? I didn't think this was a sit down restaurant...
There are too many ideas; none well executed. I hope that changes with the remodel and the new name. I would love to return and update my review.

Kris: thanks for the update! It is good to hear that you aren't the same owners as the past years (it's been quite a while since I've been in for all the reasons listed). At any rate, I'm very glad to hear you're doing things differently than the previous owners!",2

They do a pretty good set up for the games in the dining room area with screens all over. Lots of giveaways of bears merchandise during the game. Also raffle some good looking jerseys and expensive gifts at the end of games. Typical bar style food with some things on special for the games which is nice. Started having Chicago dogs which is a good idea if your a Bears bar. So if your a Chicago Bears fan and looking for a good bar to watch the game and talk with some good Chicago people this is the place. Waitresses are on top of things in the dining room even with a packed bar of Chicago people eating and drinking,2

When we first got there the decor was great it looked  super cute on the inside. We stood at the door for a minute wondering if there was a hostess and then we finally decided to just take a seat. We sat in the booth which was super cute, and waited for someone to come and greet us. We sat there for a while waiting for someone to come over when the owner finally came over and asked what she can get us. we ordered some drinks and she sent the bartender over. The bartender came back with menus and our drinks really fast. The menu looks really good. All the food looked really good by the description. I ordered a burrito and my husband ordered a burger, although the bartender didn't know if the burrito came with a side and had to look at the menu to find out. The food came out and we were excited to eat. The burger wasn't bad but the burrito was horrible. The rice seemed like it came from a box and there was no chicken in the burrito, like I had ordered. I was very disappointed. When the bartender came and brought us our check she introduced herself and shook her hand. I would never go back to this place for food. The only way I would go back is if we decided to sit at the bar and have some drinks and gamble. This place is super cute and has great potential but for how bad the economy is  you would think they would try harder to keep customers coming back.

Why was the red wine served cold?

Why were the roasted beets served with a teaspoon?

Why was the warm cooked salmon entree served atop a cold salad (ice-cold cornbread croutons and all)?  Call me uber-traditional but I think I prefer hot-on-hot and cold-on-cold.

CC Sun screens had no problem coming out to my home for a 'small' job. Their price was actually cheaper than the other company quoted me and immediately after i had the screens applied to my windows i decided i wanted screens for two sliding glass doors too. They were just installed and i LOVE them. I even requested 80% on the bug screen part for better airflow when the weather is good and they had no problem accommodating that request.

Going to Euro Nail is not worth the trip to Station Square.",1

Great thing is they are very island style with their portions, meaning they serve you like you've never ate before!!! Lol! They have bags of poi at the counter too if you like to add to your delicious meal. I saw the cooler by the door with Hawaiian sun drinks and guava cake and I think they had haupia cake as well. I have to get that next time :). The flavors were on point and everything was made fresh! The lady at the front is very nice and welcoming. Definitely a place full of Aloha!! Mahalo Island Flavor!",2

19320,3,1546992000000,"We were in the area and needed a place to eat so we stopped by this restaurant and had lunch. We walked in and were greeted and seated immediately - just in time for lunch specials. We both ordered the same dish. The curry beef brisket with rice. 

The lunch menu suppose to rotate every week. The restaurant is small with at least 22 tables (didn't really count all of them lol). The number of parking spaces is too few for the number restaurants and businesses in the same plaza. 

Back to the food - the curry sauce was a tad spicy for me and pretty standard. It was flavourful and went well with the onion, potatoes and brisket. The lunch also came with a soup (tomato or cream based), bread with butter on the side, and a choice between coffee or milk tea (hot or cold). Milk tea hot or cold is pretty good. You can request to have more milk or more tea in the drink. 

I'm satisfied with the portion size of the dish and the flavours and it was definitely very filling. I had seen a few couples actually bring their own glass containers to take leftovers home. Which is a great idea for lunch the next day. 

It wasn't amazing but overall quite decent and I would come back to try other things. If you need a refill of hot tea it's easy to request for another refill because the service is pretty attentive. Food came out fairly quickly.

If you're hungry and in the area definitely make your way over here.",2

A group of friends and I went on a Sunday night for a friends birthday we didn't make any reservations so we knew there was possibly going to be a wait to get in. We arrived and the line for general admission was by the stairs close to mcfaddens and if you know townsquare thats a long line. Usually the club lines rotate from table reservations and general admission so we figured well get in maybe 40 minutes. Well TWO HOURS LATER we finally got to the front normally we would have left but my birthday friend was already inside and thats the only reason we waited but once in front I realized why the wait was even longer than needed the ""hosts"" in front would be approached by general admission people that slip them a $20 and there group gets put infront of this line. Its a ridiculous they dont value there customers because it wasnt even discrete the guy had told my two friends and me okay your next was about to let us thru until someone slipped him some cash and we waited another 25min at least. We had asked the host when we first arrived how much the cover was and we were told $10 once we finally got inside $20 for girls and $30 for men what a scam and worst experience inside was so crowded we didnt enjoy ourselves and when my friend asked for hookah service we were told yes one minute wellll that minute never came the girl never came back.

19325,2,1546819200000,I was a fan of Churches chicken till I came to this location. Oh where do I begin. First they no longer have the popcorn chicken my kids liked so I ordered them 3 ( remember that number for later) chicken tenders. I ordered the 3 (not yet) piece meal all dark meat. I got our cups and got drinks for my kids. I wanted ice tea but the dispenser on the counter was empty. The person working the counter said he would fill my cup for me but his dispenser was almost empty. As we waited other customers came in and ordered. All of us were sitting around waiting for them to cook the food nothing was ready. When we got our food my kids 3 (ok now) piece tenders turned into 4 and my all dark meat meal had a breast in it. People who were going through the drive in were now coming inside to find out where there orders were. I went to get a refill on my ice tea but they were out.,1

19357,2,1547510400000,"Love this place!

Took mama-Chy here and for three people who ate like the royal court, the total bill was $35 with tip!

We ordered Kitchen Omelet add bacon, with Multi-Grain bread and American Fries, Meat Eater Omelet with Pancakes, and Hashbrowns, and Eggs Benedict. Also, three coffees.

They make their own bread, the multi-grain is a heartier, thicker (think Texas toast), yet soft and chewy. Their pancakes are billed as 'Plate-Sized' and it's not a false advertisement, they are as big as the plate, in fact it was even hanging over the plate a bit. The omelets were huge! Bigger than the two eggs it states it's made with, perhaps it's all the generous fillings of vegetables and meats that make this a stand-out both in portion and flavor. Sometimes, the bacon is under cooked, or chewy in an omelet, not here, they are crispy!

I'd recommend the American Fries, the quartered potatoes have a flavorful crunch and the insides were not mushy nor dry.

The staff here never miss a beat, I don't believe our koffee kups were ever beyond half empty.

Get here early, as it does fill up and the tiny parking lot is a zoo on weekends and most morning.

We've been here for dinner as well and really enjoyed their burgers!

She beat me there, was halfway through a cinnamon oat scone, rice krispy treat and a coffee, and was so pleased with everything that she proclaimed all meetings will henceforth be at local coffee shops. That's a big deal for her to abandon Cinnabon!

So - Urban Beans is a cute little coffee shop. Ample seating inside, cute art on the walls that's for sale, and a really nice little patio outside. 

I had a soy white mocha and a java chip scone, and it was only $7.50  That would run $10 at the big green mermaid!  Both were really really good. 

They aren't doing made-to-order food anymore, which is what I think most bad reviews are about. The pastries are all freshly baked though.

Only thing that could be better is put some music on or something. It was deathly quiet and I felt like everyone else was listening to our conversation. We moved outside because of that.",2

They have a large casino floor and it is an open lay out.  They have a few restaurants:  Buffet, Cafe, Restaurant (nicer), hot dog vendor ($0.75), Deli, and a steak n shake.  Movie theaters and bowling alley.  Things here are very cheap compared to the strip.",2
19384,1,1547424000000,"They did a great job remodeling that old building. The restaurant is built around a rectangular bar with comfy looking booths along the outer wall, and some tables up front. Behind the building is kind of like an open corridor space - across from which is a patio structure. They have a well-stocked full bar with 7 or 8 wines on ""tap"" and a whole bunch of craft beers. The menu is comprised of a few appetizers, salads and sandwiches, everything priced below $12 or so. Unfortunately for me I try to avoid carbs which means ordering a salad for dinner, not something I do often. I settled for the halibut sandwich - and took off the bun. The fish, fancy mayo and veggies were a perfect blend, fish was cooked perfectly...

Although last time it was perfection from start to end...sadly, this time it wasn't.

Our waiter didn't give his name and seemed very indifferent.  The attitude was that he rather be anywhere but at work.  With the money we pay, pretend to have a personality!!!

We ordered...
Green Geisha - not as good as last time.  Couldn't taste much of the drink (mostly water)
Tuna Tataki - okay
Cucumber Salad - Delicious!
Kobe Beef Taco - bland and nothing I want to have again.
Hot Mess - Delicious!!
Spicy Tuna - Delicious!

As much as I loved some of the foods, the ones that weren't good were pretty bad.  My drink was disappointing ( last time it was perfect!).

She was literally on top of his lap when we walked in? crazy. We were in the mood for good seafood so we didnt order sushi but they do offer it. Kinda pricy place, but it was good. I went with the blackened catfish with mac n cheese with veggies. oh so good. everything I tasted was delicious. I didnt order the dinner salad and glad I didnt but I did clean my plate, everything was so good. Mybf  ordered tilapia. kinda bland in my opinion but he doesnt like salt... I do... i like herbs and spices.. and this place had it. even on the veggies. Its a must try - hard to turn down the bbq nxt door but if you can you must try this place. 
Side note: we felt like a mexican whole stole something @ macy's everyone was looking at us--- not the couple making out??

19394,3,1548460800000,"I'm a host at a restaurant on the strip and as important as having good food at a restaurant is, having good customer service is just as important, if not more. I dined here on a Saturday night with two friends, we figured it would be polite to call and reserve in advance. When we arrived, on time, I told the hostesses my name for the reservation and without a word spoken to me, I was handed a buzzer. We didn't wait long before we got a table, but the hostess said only one word to us when she sat us, ""enjoy"". It seemed rushed and very ingeniune. We didn't even get so much as a smile out of her. 

Next, our waiter arrived and got right to the point of taking our order. I tried asking which flavor of Italian soda would be best and he basically told me they're all gross. I picked one at random anyway and it was delicious. 

We waited and waited for the always anticipated bread sticks and we got both our appetizers and our meals before we finally saw our waiter again (the food runner delivered everything) and we asked for our bread sticks. The manager promptly arrived to apologize for this mishap and said we would receive them shortly. He also offered us all a free dessert on the house as an apology. 

An extra salad plate was brought by who was described to us as our waiters partner, but I told him we didn't need or want one. He shoved it toward me and said to take it anyway ""just in case"". It was in my way while I tried to rearrange our other plates to make room for the unwanted plate. 

Our bread sticks finally arrived just as we finished our meals and were too full to eat more than a bite of them. We asked for boxes for our appetizers and as we prepared to scoop the brushetta into the container we came across a hair inside it. I had been snacking on this my whole meal. Yum. I tried telling my waiter about the hair and I had to repeat myself because he wasn't listening the first time. The manager arrived again to apologize and offered to make a new brushetta to take home.

Although the managers attempted to make up for the problems, the complete lack of customer service combined with the ridiculously late bread sticks and the hair in my food, it was an overall dissapointing and regretful experience.

Our server was fast and brought our drinks, chips and salsa right away.  

Everyone at our table ordered different things, from fajitas to tacos to burritos.  Everyone enjoyed their food and the price was not bad considering how high it could have been for its location on the strip.  

The waitresses all dancing every half hour (or whatever it is) is actually entertaining because some of them are really into it and others are definitely not.  It entertained our group at least.

Besides, there's a couple eateries & a gas station within walking distance who could probably provide that.  AC works great--very important in Vegas.  Wifi was fast enough for me.

Anyways, showed up with my daughter (12 yrs old) tonight.  Walked in and was a little bit confused.  The hostess at the front walked us through, gave a great explanation of how things worked, escorted us to our table, gave us a menu, and we were on our way.

The build your own salad bar is now one-time thru only (which is what we did, everything else looked way too expensive when you add it all up).  Everything is now priced separately... cafeteria-style... and it's pay per item, except for fountain drinks and their small selection of house breads.

The atmosphere is trendy and the staff was decent, but the prices are very high.  If you are not careful you will walk out of there paying quite a bit more than expected.  Also - be aware they add 7.5% gratuity onto your bill unless you specifically request they not do so.

All in all, the food was alright, but the experience is not worth the price.  We will not be returning to Field Kitchen again.  So disappointed... and we are huge fans of Sweet Tomatoes.  Goodbye - you will be missed.",2

19438,2,1547424000000,"This used to be our main neighborhood sushi spot, our go-to on Sunday nights. Lately though, Kiku has failed to maintain its level of service and quality of food.

Staff are usually pleasant enough, though there's been a few times we've been rushed out of the restaurant after paying and one highly unusual time where we were scolded for paying with a credit card? But besides that, mostly good service. (Note: we used to be regulars here, so our faces are pretty familiar. Also, we specifically avoid this one lady at all costs, which is probably why this service review is better than most.)

The restaurant is never too busy, which is kind of nice. The seating is comfortable and they'll let you pick where you want to sit if you're particular. The decoration is nothing special, but not outdated, and the restaurant is pretty casual.

They have switched from paper menus to iPad, which is very convenient for their all-you-can-eat but can be hard at times for a la cart because no one is there to serve you. Also, you have to do a lot of scrolling to see the whole menu.

The fish quality is really what's gone down in the last year. My family is a longtime lover of Ikura (salmon roe), but found it EXTREMELY fishy and salty the last few times. On more than one occasion, we have also found their Ika (squid) and Salmon to be slimy. Their rice is pretty good though, and their tempura can get soggy but has also maintained a good rep.

I wish I could give this place a better review, but unfortunately it seems it's been pretty downhill for Kiku. They've recently stopped delivery and only do pick-up. I hope they can improve and come back to their old self!",2

The interior decoration of this place classy and clean (That hasn't changed from my older review). As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I received a warm welcoming and I was served hot jasmine tea which is always appreciated during the winter :)

I received the menu and I did pick two things: chicken/shrimp spring rolls and XL Pho dac biet. The portions for the rolls are huge, I just wish it was sliced before presenting it to me because I have no knife on table. It tasted fresh and the sauce that came with it was delightful.

Previously, I mentioned that the broth for the pho was too salty.This time, it was perfect. Very generous meat portion, very fresh ingredients and I did appreciate having on table the real chilli sauce instead of Sriracha. XL is probably the largest serving of pho that I ever had in Montreal.

Amazing food. 
Amazing wine list. 
Amazing views. 

The house sauce for the beef is to die for. It's a homemade soy rice wine and perfectly complements the meat. 

There is a bone-in 12oz fillet that you wouldn't know it was there unless the wait staff tells you about it. It's not a special, it's just not on the menu. The truffled mashed potatoes are excellent - very rich. The gulf shrimp wrapped in bacon as an appetizer was good. 

Inside is stated decor. We sat outside on the patio, overlooking the fountains at the Bellagio. We had a new show every 15 minutes. 

There is a dress code - jacket or at least collar shirt/tie for guys. It is pricey (2 of us had $300 check). But you get what you pay for in food and service. 

I have to say that the bathrooms were not what I expected of a restaurant of this caliber. They were kind of rundown, not spacious, there were hand towels that they were out of, also out of soap. Not that I need an attendant to hand me a towel and expect a big fat tip, just a little kept up.",2

I presented the front desk clerk my information to which he proceeded to process my rental.  He asked for my proof of insurance, which I presented along with my additional insurance that I purchased for rentals.  I was informed that what I presented was not good enough and that he needed my entire 14 page policy from USAA.  Needless to say, I do not carry the 14 pages with me.  He denied my rental, even after I informed him that it was pre-paid.  Never have I been denied rental service.

When I walked in last night, there were no towels. There was a big container full of towels and honestly I could not tell if they were clean or not. The front desk clerk, who was busy on his cellphone told me to get the towels from the container. I hope they were clean.

What our party of 4 experienced at the Vegas location of Beauty & Essex was one of the top ten meals I have had alltime.  I highly recommend going to the restaurant with a party of 4 as almost all of the items on the menu come out tapas style that are perfectly sized for 4 people.  

The restaurant is all Vegas.  Dark and bustling, but the service is friendly and our server was particularly knowledgeable on the food.  All in all we had 14 dishes (3 of those were desserts) without a miss in the entire bunch.  Each and every dish I would order again, but the cool thing about the menu is that there were so many other items on the menu that sounded delicious that we didn't get to try.  Makes a return trip inevitable.  

Too many dishes to describe each, but the standouts among the standouts were the Tomato Tartare, Grilled Cheese and Tomato Soup dumplings, Mexican Street Corn Ravioli, Double Barrel Pork Chop al Pastor, and the Chorizo Carbonara mac & Cheese.

The kalbi has nice charred grilled marks. It also has a marination without the sweetness over powering the meat. The kalbi compliments well with a nice touch of acidity and a little sweetness from the salad dressing. The mandoo wrapper seemed thicker than other places,  but it does have a flavorful taste. 

The place is not that big, but still has a comfortable atmosphere feel without all the fancy decor. The staff and service are always great. This location about equals to their other location on Craig. Again, great place to dine in with good portion sizes to fill up my hunger any day of the week!",3

Every time I'm at this location, I just miss the rush. I turn around in line and see a swarm of people starting to gather. I truly think someone's watching out for me or maybe I just eat during nontraditional hours.

I'll be honest, I won't branch out and try something new. I always get a bag of chips with a steak burrito bowl with a tortilla on the side OR a steak burrito . I also get extra rice, a little bit of corn, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce. (Was it just me or did you envision going down the line?)

19605,3,1548892800000,"About a year and a half ago I faced the terrifying situation of having an upper bridge, spanning 4 teeth, literally fall out. I immediately went to the dentist who placed the bridge and was told it would take 5 days to even begin assessing the situation - only heightening my anxiety. I was referred to Dr. Adam Block by a friend and seeing him is the single best decision I've made in my oral healthcare journey. 

100% empathetic to my situation, he squeezed me in during his lunch hour, quickly assessed, gave me options, and began molding a temporary immediately. Needless to say, this won me over! 

Many dental visits later, I am a huge fan! He is consistently professional, inviting, caring, and never ever inflates what really needs to be done. (In the past, after cleanings, Dentists would recommend a million things needing to be done and all for a very low astronomical fee). The office is full of joy and always very clean! 

As a person who was always nervous about visiting the dentist, I am thrilled to say I now actually enjoy visiting! Sincerely, if you suffer from dental anxiety (it has to be a thing), I highly recommend Dr. Block!

If you are looking for an amazing fulfilling meal, particularly breakfast, in a casual diner atmosphere, this is the place.

The location is a little tough to find (2nd floor, corner, in a strip mall), but upon arriving your are greeted by an amusing sign forbidding you to bring any meat into the restaurant (no BYO meat!  lol).   The menu has a lot of options (which are played on 2 TV screens as you wait  *drool*).   Having read the Yelp reviews we decided to go with a bunch of items including some of the favorites:  Roti, Lettuce Wraps, and Crispy Spicy Eggplant.  The Eggplant dish was tasty but you definitely want a larger group to take down this platter.. nice and crispy, but obviously very fried.. good flavor.. and probably at least an entire eggplant.   The Roti and Lettuce Wraps were two of the favorite dishes.  The entrees came with tasty brown rice.  We opted to avoid the ""fake meat"" style dishes and went more with the vegetables/tofu/fried rice/noodles-type dishes.  Dessert was decent - vegan ice cream was tasty, but a tad icy and the fried root was only good as an ornament in my opinion.  vegan cheesecake was pretty yummy.  

When we arrived there were ~5 other tables... not bad for Weds at 7:00, but not busy.  However once our food came out (remarkably quickly!) the business started to pick up!  When we left most of the restaurant was impressively filled.

19646,1,1548460800000,"Saw Train and The Fray last night. The good:

-Parking was fairly straightforward and free. When arriving, we took Loop 101 south, then Thomas east to 83rd south. Absolutely no traffic problems at 5:30 on a weekday. Much better than trying to fight rush hour on I-10 west. Getting out of the lot took about 10 minutes as we were parked right next to the west gate.

-Sound system was perfect. We were in section 204 and everything was crystal clear. Decent view of the stage for this large of a venue. This was my first time here. I prefer venues like Marquee and Club Red which are much smaller, but for big time national acts Desert Sky does the job.

-Concession and bathroom lines were almost nonexistent. Though based on the crowd composition I'm going to take a guess and say the women's room line was much longer than the men's room ;) 

The bad:

-Concession prices are out of this world. Plan on spending $11-15 PER BEER (!), $6 for a 1 liter water, and about $9-12 for an entree food item (I had a personal size pepperoni pizza which was decent, but not $9 decent). You're much better off pregaming somewhere else before coming to the show. This bullet point loses two stars alone. Vegetarian options are spartan: looked like just cheese pizza, a black bean burger, and a loaded nachos, plus a few other snack type items.

-Some of the seating sections carry 60+ seats in a row, so it takes some work if you need to get out of the section from the middle seats.

-The two outside sections and the very back of the seating areas are not under the overhang, so take this into consideration if you're coming to a daytime show.

Would I come back? Yes, if there was a band I *really* wanted to see. But I would do my eating and drinking elsewhere for one third of the price.",2

19685,3,1548201600000,"My friend lives in Las Vegas and she mentioned that Metro Diner was opening and it had been featured on Diners, Drive ins and Dives.  I googled it  I watched the show from 2010.  They featured a dish called Yo Hala on the Square.  I decided that I needed that.  

Arrived in Vegas on Sunday and Metro was on the schedule for Monday's first meal of the day.  When you're on vacation the first meal may not be before noon but, fear not, breakfast is served all day.  These are my kind of people.  

The restaurant is clean and bright.  There were plenty of open tables and we were seated immediately.  Our server, Nick, showed up promptly.  Specials are listed on a blackboard.  Between that and the menu, choices are difficult--a tough problem to have--but I already knew what I would be getting.  My friends perused the menu with the understanding that they would each be getting a portion of my food because it sounded like the best thing that ever got invented...food-wise.

We felt so welcomed there.  Both managers stopped by the table to ask how things were.  Nick was never too far away and came back often.  He liked us and, make no mistake, we loved his service.  Everyone seems to enjoy conversing and bantering with the customers.  We were laughing so much with them I don't know how we were able to eat.

The food was dynamite.  We all oohed and aahed over our huge and beautifully plated dishes and each enjoyed our choices very much.  I couldn't finish mine.  I'm told that most people can't.  Mine was the big hit of the table.  Of course.

I have to admit that I grabbed some local friends and brought them back there the next day because I needed to try other things.  I was laughing so hard when everyone came by to welcome us back.  Nick was there but he was leaving for the day so he couldn't serve us but he definitely stopped by as if to catch up with old friends.  Our server on this day was Jaci (pronounced JayCee).  She is so sweet and delightful.  I tried the avocado breakfast sandwich.   After I had ordered, the table next to us had received a Monte Cristo sandwich.  OMG that looked so good that I wanted to change my mind.  Then, another table got a French Dip sandwich.  That looked so good that I wanted to change my mind.    That just means I have to go back again on my next trip.  

Prices are reasonable and our service was peerless.  It's a friendly place and, even if the food weren't as excellent as it was, I'd still give it a great rating because I had so much fun just being there.  Ask for Nick or Jaci as your servers.  I'm sure the others are very good but these two are exemplary and will add to your overall enjoyment of the experience.

P.S. The place has only been open a few weeks so I suspect that anybody who did not have a great food experience could chalk that up to the kitchen staff getting up to speed and finding their stride.",2
19687,1,1547424000000,"It has been a while that this restaurant has closed for renovation. The restaurant looks similar to how  it used to look like before with minor changes. I have always enjoyed the relaxing instrumental music that is playing in the restaurant. The aroma of coffee just enriched the atmosphere even more. 

It seems like the menu has been upgraded and the variety of food has been broadened as well. I don't remember that they served rice before, but now they offer choices of sandwiches, rice and salad, on top of pasta. 
I ordered a shrimp okinomiyaki and a cup of black sesame latte. 

Shortly after, salad came first. It was on the house. Basically the salad was lettuce leaves with a few carrot pieces and sesame salad dressing. It's a bit plain but the dressing tasted unique and it makes the simple rich. 

Then my order, Shrimp Okonomiyaki , arrived. It has a slice of toast on the side of the pasta. It is spaghetti sautéed with onion, shrimps and bacons. On top of the spaghetti, sauces like Japanese Mayonnaise and Steak sauce, were put on top of the spaghetti. These are the same kind of dressings one will use to make Okonomiyaki . I believe the chef has also added cheese in the pasta. 

Last but not least, the black sesame latte was delicious. Just like having a light sesame paste dessert. This is an amazing lunch!!",2

This waffle is so delicious that you think to yourself, ""If I could never eat again, this was a good last food to have."" I plan to mix things up a little bit this spring, trying more of the ice cream flavors and fruit toppings. However, no matter what you put on top of these waffles, they will be delicious.

Even though I enjoyed the experience, I actually would prefer going to the Oakland location in the spring/summer. This location is a dive with barstools facing a wood paneled wall.

SItting in ""VIA-Train"" like proximity across from an attractive outgoing duo, I made a conscious decision to put my I-phone DOWN for once and make a joke about the face-to-face seating arrangement.  And just like that we were off and running!  Chitchatting about venues in Toronto, projects on the do, his daughters, her Brazilian background, how cool the indie passport is... and life... complete with witty banter in between.  It was such fun to meet a fellow extrovert who was excited to connect across a vintage metal coffee table, while the rest of the cafe was plugged into headphones and free WIFI.

There were plenty of towels, soaps, and shampoos for our two night stay and service was never an issue. There was a full kitchen which did not have an oven however, which made it difficult to cook our frozen pizzas late night.

At first, they told us they were booked solid. The day before, they called us back and advised that they will get us in, as previously requested. 

This place was pretty fancy. At least on this night, everyone was dressed in their best. The service was formal as well, from the moment I arrived I noticed that. I prefer somewhere more down to earth and less formal, but it definitely made for a special night. One thing that I don't particularly care for is how close the tables are to each other. So close, you could hear and smell everything from the party next to you (I know this because someone ordered a dish with truffles and it smelled divine).

I ordered the scallops, served with roasted potatoes and escarole. Let me just say, when I smelled the aroma from my neighbors dish, I wished I had ordered that. Don't get me wrong, best scallops award. That's where my happiness ended. The potatoes were bland, literally no flavor at all. I didn't even taste salt, butter or garlic, nada. And the escarole was difficult to eat. Not worth the calories and too much lemon (something I thought I would never say). Next time, I will order pasta.

The chips and salsa was probably some of the best I've had. The steak chimichanga I had there was pretty good. The texture was perfectly crispy, but the fillings (steak, veggies, rice) were realllly salty. Also, my bf ordered a drink, a double shot of tequila and for 9 bucks per shot, that was a $20 drink! That's a bottle! Anyway, overall it was a good night and the prices were somewhat high for casual Mexican, but I might try this place again.",3

Again, on Foodora, this platter says it feeds 3 people. However, there were only 1 or 2 items of each. Only 1 beef skewer, only 2 falafels. But thankfully 3 breads and rice.

Not gonna lie, with the beat up sign and empty parking lot, it makes you wonder how good it really is. I saw on yelp that it had great reviews though and trying to find real korean food in henderson is practically nonexistent. I was craving yukgaejang like crazy so I gave in and I'm sure glad I did.
My husband and I ordered yukgaejang (spicy beef and veggie soup), bindaeduk (korean pancake) and of course their famous meat jun. It all came out to $30 and they give you really good banchan with everything. I read on a previous review that the portions were small. Maybe when you eat there it might be, idk, but ordering for take out the portions were definitely no where near small. We didn't even finish everything besides the meat jun (which my husband devoured). They give you a lot of rice with your orders. Also, I'm pretty sure they gave us about 3 large slices of the pancake but I can't be certain because we ate them so quickly and had about one slice left. The yukgaejang was perfectly spicy and still really hot by the time I got home. Their banchans (side dishes) were spot on as well.

I had the beef sirloin and shortrib - very ordinary, none of the amazing flavours like at Canoe. Sirloin was undercooked by two levels.   Squash soup was good, but nothing mind blowing. 

My girlfriend's turkey salad was average. The turkey had an old and stale aftertaste.  Def not what i expected from Oliver & Bonacini.  Her lamb was good, but again, nothing extraordinary like in Canoe.   Definitely not worth even the Winterlicious price, let alone the a la carte.

Small plates unique, flavorful, and satisfying; we tried beef tartare, squid, chicken legs, and shrimp plates. Not one dish disappointed. Our one regret is that we did not pace the ordering as the dishes came out all at once and stymied an effort for a relaxing slow meal. Our 2nd regret was eating the complimentary cheddar puffs. Although the puffs were very good, they were also filling and nipped our appetites. The beef tartare was a true highlight with flash fried seaweed, capers, taro chips, and a quail egg. 

Service was very friendly, attentive, and down to earth.

Valets definitely need an improved cone and thoroughfare area; it was awkwardly staged and did not have an obvious traffic flow to compliment the restaurant.

I love the decor and how they can open the front wall to let the outside in. We arrived around 4:30 on a Sunday for an early dinner and because the Chagrin Falls location is small, we ended up eating at the bar. The bartender was pleasant and we chit chatted before ordering. About 5 minutes after placing our order, he comes back and says there has been a computer glitch and he can't find our order. No problem, we tell him again. One burger, one blackened grouper sandwich and an order of fries to split. (Fries are a la carte at Flip Side.) About 10 minutes later our fries show up. As I am someone who has bar tended and waited tables, I know there's a desire to have the entire meal show up within a minute or two of each other, so I wait to eat any fries. Plus, I want to eat my fries WITH my sandwich. So I wait, and wait, and after about 5 minutes, i ask the bartender if we are going to get our sandwiches soon. He checks and says another 5 minutes, so I ask him to get us a fresh order of fries with our food since that's how we ordered it. He takes the original fries away and after about 10 minutes our burger and fish sandwich show up, but no fries. The bartender says nothing, so I proceed to eat slooooowly, hoping the fries will show up. (We're all seeing the irony here, right?) Of course the bartender, despite never being more than 10 feet away from us, never checks back to see if everything is OK. So eventually I finish my sandwich and flag him down asking if he was ever going to bring us our fries or not. He gets this flustered look, goes and yells at someone in the kitchen, but still no fries appear. After another minute or two, I tell him to forget it and cancel the fries. He then offers to take them off the bill. Duh! Of course you will, so thanks for nothing. He then promises to really take good care of us next time. Isn't he supposed to do that every time?
My wife thought her burger was very good. My blackened grouper sandwich was average. The size of the bun dominated the small piece of fish, so it was fairly bland. It was also way overpriced. For $15 I was expecting a much better piece of fish, plus sides were extra.
I typically give restaurants a second chance, and I probably will do so for Flip Side Burgers, but my first experience was very disappointing. There was nothing difficult about what we wanted, they just dropped the ball over and over.",2

Please don't waste your time or money at this place. It's a business and not a restaurant. They were more interesting in seating you right away and getting your money rather than sharing any quality food or service. It truly was disappointing for us.",3

Marg Pizza- Crispy, not burnt crust.

Bread Service w/burrata. Delicious, made in house. 

Rigatoni Carbonara- creamy sauce, crispy guanciale, fresh pasta

Delicious cocktails. I recommend there nigroni.",2

So many great places to eat around here and this being as expensive as most anything, I felt like it could have been better. I had the lamb and it was good but a really petite portion. Drinks were over priced and the service was okay but didnt impress me. So, overall I wouldn't go back. However, the venue is really cool sitting outside in the center of that tower is a nice treat.",2

Totally fun. You can upload photos from FB and Instagram and turn them into prints that look like Polaroids. They also have frames to fit and other cool ways to display your prints. We created Christmas gifts for our family using the pics from our phones.

I have a bunch of pictures set aside on my phone to get prints made the next time I'm in Vegas. Sure, I could print them at home, but these look so unique it's worth the trip.

The photos seem to be ink-jet printed onto thick card stock, so they still look good a year later.",2
19875,3,1546905600000,"this store was kind enough to divide itself into two distinctly sex based stores so that all of us who have difficulty distinguishing between the mens and womens garments no longer have to suffer in silence.

this small store was the mens store.  in it were blazers/sport jackets (whatever the hell sport that it is youd play in them i dont know), light long sleeve tee shirts, short sleeve tee shirts, some shoes, belts, bags, pants - both casual like jeans and more formal like, you know, sport pants (for that same elusive sport above).

although i didnt ask and i would venture to say that if i really loved it they would order it in for me, make it or whatever it is they do, but they had about one size for each style of hat they had and though the selection seemed varied (for not being a hatter shop - hatter is the right term; i do my research), it was disheartening to have the majority of the hats resemble dunce hats on my head because they couldnt fit around its girth.

(im fully willing to accept that im projecting the anger felt about my fat dome.)

anyhow, they had those fargo hats with the flaps in a few different styles, some simple bowl toques that are in style these days (overpriced anywhere you go in my opinion) and a few caps here and there.  all pretty cool and though not all styles agreed with me (we are talking taste wise here not swelled noggin), it was nice to see the variety.

for about 60 or so dollars you could pick up a leather belt with an impressive buckle.  the beauty of this belt is that once youve picked the right leather, first of all you can mix and match, because the belts and buckles are sold separately, and secondly, you can always come back for an alternate buckle (or buy as many buckles as you like at the same time i suppose).

there were some really cool baseball tee shirts with those 3/4 arms that were very very thin and weathered in some way where patches of it looked thicker in material and some parts were much thinner.  great shirt, but itd be a shirt id wear once in a while when i knew i was doing something nowhere near related to a game of baseball.  

the long sleeve collared shirts also stood out to me, with varied styles, nice patterns and fabrics.  the jackets seemed not to stand out in the same way.

all in all, i enjoyed this shop, will come here again, probably to buy a belt first and i look forward to their continued success.",2

19888,1,1546905600000,"I am going to write this review as honestly as I possibly can.

I've been here twice with friends already and both times the food has been great. Good presentation, tasty food, big portion sizes. However both times the service has been a bit abysmal. I don't know if this is a common trend, but we waited literally 45 minutes for pancakes to come out for our table of 2 and the time I went today the food took over an hour to come out ! At the 50 minute mark I flagged down the waitress and said we might just leave because it's been too long and the manager told us it's on the house and then the food came out 10 minutes after, albeit a bit cold.

It's almost disappointing that such a good place, with such good presentation and food has to be ruined by terribly slow service. The waitress was super kind both times.",2

The wait is interminable and in the meantime with the long line adding up, the ""cutters"" move in slow motion and chit-chat like they have all the time in the world. Can they move any slower???

Then after you get your item cut to your specification, you have to stand in YET ANOTHER LINE at the front of the store to pay for your item. Once again, the cashiers move like thickened molasses.

So what am I saying here? I'm saying that the service here is very, very terrible and sluggish. When you come here, be prepared to spend a lot of time waiting in long, slowly-moving lines.

Hmmmm....doesn't sound great when I say it, but man, these burgers are good.  This is the original Swenson's (Cuyahoga Ave.) and everything tastes better here for some reason.

19931,3,1546387200000,"I first stumbled upon this place a few weeks ago.  It looks like a high-dollar gambling area with a bar, and it is.  The slot machines at the bar are $1 minimum.  The reason I like this bar is the female bartenders and the female cocktail waitress eye candy.  Another reason is the good selection of bourbons and whiskeys, and sure Scotch too.  They have Breaking & Entering bourbon which you won't find many places west of the Mississippi.  1842 Tavern at MGM has an even better bourbon and Scotch menu.  That's the real big hidden treasure for Vegas if you're a bourbon or Scotch fan.  There are TV's all around the place, so you can watch your favorite big sport games.  They were kind enough to play a Nevada footbal game which is a rare treat coming from Reno.  Their shortcoming is the limited beer menu.  For such a high-end bar, you'd think they can be a little bit more original than corporate swill and light beers.  How about a Sam Adams or Sierra NV at least, at least.  But it doesn't really matter in the final analysis, because you're only really here for the hot bartenders.  Vegas I've been told is such a union town it's hard to find young, attractive female bartenders.  You mostly get 50-year-old crusty dudes who mostly do not appreciate the new craft cocktail trend.  And oh yeah, the cocktails at this bar are laughable.  You might as well add a Scoobie Snack and Slippery Nipple.  MGM, seriously, take a visit to Cosmo to get better cocktail ideas.",2

I will recommend the salmon burger and my husband is a fan of their homemade sausage pizza.   The bluegill is nothing special and there are no sides except coleslaw or pickle that accompany most dishes.  I was excited when I heard they were opening gut breakfast on the weekends but we were underwhelmed.  High prices for typical breakfast fare. 

If they start adding more locally sourced fresh options I think they would attract more customers.",2

My companions had chicken tikka masala and lamb korma, and enjoyed both. However, the food took very long to prepare. We waited over 30 min and the restaurant was quite empty at the time.

The Internet sales director is April Jacob and I worked John Giger and Bruce Smith. John's new at the dealership but a class act.  Bruce is an old hand and helped John when necessary.  I worked with two finance managers who were both very professional.

April and John bent over backward to create a positive buying experience and when I was done I didn't feel like I'd had to battle tooth and nail to ""get a deal"".  John worked with us over the course of two weeks to test drive several cars, work through pricing as I made sure the price, the features and the financing was where I wanted it prior to committing to moving forward.

I would advise all consumers to find a way in through the internet buying service so you get experienced sales staff as opposed to the less experienced staff for the walk in traffic.  If you dislike the person on the phone you can easily ask to work with someone else or move on to another dealer.

I used Kelly Blue Book on line, Edmunds.com, YouTube (car review videos) and downloaded and used a autoloan/lease financial calculator and did my own work before I went to the dealership. With the information available on the internet and through the sales person, I figured out all the financial information I needed in advance and was able to do this at my leisure.",2

Nobody in the place so 3 or 4 server-girls are just standing in the back staring like they were chained to the bar or lost. My server Ryan was the only person who had a pulse and is always enthusistic about the food and alcohol selections. He is very attentitive and takes care of his guests.Perhaps the server-girls should shadow him and see how he works. So another woman, maybe another manager comes in and takes Ryan into the back room for a meeting? So with four customers in the place you would think the server-girls would check on us.

I had the salmon tartar, the cod terrine and the pecan tart for dessert.  They bring you bread with olive oil and black cured olives right at the beginning of the meal.  We both loved everything.  The salmon tartar had a slight citrus flavour and was served with an avocado mouse.  The portion was small, light and refreshing - very clean flavours.  The cod terrine was similar to a sheppard's pie except it was made with salted cod in the base of it and topped with whipped potatoes.  It had a wine flavoured gravy on the bottom of the plate.  The pecan tart was delicious.  I tasted my husband's grilled salted cod and it was so fresh and delicious.

37342,2,1547510400000,"THE WORST TRIP HERE EVER! Super disappointing too because we frequent this place for my sons haircuts. Might be time to look elsewhere if this change in service is a permanent thing.

We checked in online which usually works really well, we arrived and Shaylee (sp?) greeted us, we told her we checked in and then said it would only be a few minutes. The lobby filled up quickly so about 3 min later there were a good 6 people waiting. One stylist was cutting someone's hair, another stylist arrived (from break I'm assuming) took another customer and then Shaylee took one. (1st point...not sure why it took her almost 6-8 min to take a customer). Shaylee finished (before the other 2 mind you) then something occured with the computer. She spent 10 minutes complaining about the computer, all the while the other 2 were telling her to call someone to help her fix it. Shaylee told one stylist that Elaine (I might have the name wrong, but it was the 3rd stylist) was going to do it, so the stylist replied with ""but shes curting hair and your not, so you should call"". Shaylee then said ""I won't understand what she's saying anyways""...then they both say ""you understand English don't you?"" (Really funny BTW)

Keep in mind everyone in the lobby could hear this whole conversation and Shaylee saying she's not going to take anymore customers since she can't check them out. Everyone in the lobby (about 8-10 now) was looking at each other like should we leave or what. Fast forward....they ask if anyone is paying cash and we say we are. 

Now mind you it has literally been an hour now since our original check in. When we checked in our wait time was 18 min so we sat in the store for almost 45 min before being seen (mind you no apology or explanation for the long wait, horrible service, situation, etc). 

Now this is my mistake I should have known not to let her touch my sons hair. We explained what he wanted and she went to work, fast! She was shaving his sides so fast, she went to high on the fade. The line to his fade was clear, so how she (as a professional) clearly missed it and messed it up is beyond me.  She also cut the top too much...long and short he hated his hair cut. 

Horrible experience!",2

They push several appetizers on their menu as ""must try"" - I tried to ask what was in the Pang and The Shit but not only did the waiter not answer me, he put them into our order and we were forced to eat (or pay extra for without eating) both apps which turned out to be all fake crab. I was just asking about them, NOT ordering them!

Nearly every roll has fake crab in it. Ordered the King Lobster roll because it did not list crab as an ingredient, but not only did it have crab, it did not have lobster. Even with asking for sauces on the side, the rolls were also all sweet so we gave up on them after a while and concentrated on nigiri.

Nigiri was okay though the rice ratio is off. A lot of people like it this way but it is far from authentic. With the long slice of fish leaving a tail that hangs off the little round ball of rice, they look like sperm. (I did notice that the more we ordered the bigger the balls of rice became, but that could have been a coincidence.) The salmon was the best fish they had. The super white tuna (ono) was both pretty good too. Unagi and yellowtail were fine, nothing special. Tuna and albacore were so-so. Ocean trout was stringy. We liked the two seared salmon items, but the garlic tuna and the 300 albacore tasted too similar. We were here for lunch so did not get the dinner-only salmon belly, oyster, uni or amaebi.

Mini udon was good - the broth was a little on the sweet side, but the noodles were nice and chewy, not overcooked at all.

Agedashi tofu was okay. Flavor profile of the sauce was off and the breading was a little too thick for agedashi.

I'm not usually much of a sweets person but the dessert may have been the best part. Both the green tea panna cotta and the black sesame blanc mange were very firm and not too sweet. Both had developed a skin on top, so if you like pudding skin you'll like this. I don't know if they changed the policy since that other guy's review where he was able to order unlimited desserts, but we were only allowed one per person.

Unlimited refills on $1.50 iced tea. They have regular and green, and both can be unsweetened.

I didn't see any signs about the free drink with review. All I saw was a sign saying they could only split bills into 6 checks per group.

The ladies' room was painted in fake Hello Kitties all over the walls. They were obviously amateur but not bad considering it was done freehand. And there was a lamp that looked like it was from Ikea - the nearest Ikea to Vegas is in West Covina, CA - my local back in LA!

They played a lot of Korean music videos, including 3 different Psy songs. They also played a Girls Generation song that sounded like they were saying ""I've got a boy on my chin"" - is this a song about having a dead conjoined fraternal twin fetus on your face?

They did let us order the AYCE lunch with 3 minutes to go before dinnertime. Can't say for sure I'll be back but it was worlds better than Sushi 21.",3

Events are amazing and alway have a fun atmosphere but I've recently noticed that the day staff (servers/bartenders) aren't welcoming. This isn't just a one time occasion, it's been a handful and multiple different employees. It usually takes the server some time to greet my party and lately there hasn't been any welcoming vibes from the servers. I've waited countless amount of times for a sever to even come back and check on their table. I manage in the food service industry and knowing that the FOH staff aren't welcoming isn't helping the company, I'm aware that it's a ""bar"" and I'm not expecting 5 star services but I ask for the day FOH crew to smile and make me want to come back for food.",2

Went back to vegas at the end of May, stayed at the Flamingo. Complimentary suites for diamond rewards members was absolutely crackalackin. I don't think i've ever stayed in a nicer/larger suite in my life. Two bedrooms, full bar, three flat screens not including the two tv's per bathroom inside the mirrors? Dining table, lounge area, this place was bigger than my apartment.

Although I didn't pay for any of it, so I can't really yelp the price/value aspect, the Flamingo is a bit outdated, i had a chance to see the normal rooms and they are as tacky and aged as it gets. The lobby area is too old-fashioned and attracts an older crowd which isn't my thing and the tables need a bit of life injected into them. I noticed that they copied planet hollywood's pleasure pit by adding those gogo dancers at the 2nd entrance...  imitation is the highest form of flattery?

With this place I expect to see meat brought to the table every couple  of minutes when the place holder is flipped green but literally in a hour and a half period we got serviced twice. 

I'll be honest we were there for the sirloin and the flank steak and lamb, but what we kept getting was the chicken covered in bacon, ribs, and the sausage .......when things actually  came around. 

I'm not sure what happened but there was no excuse for this. The lower level was NOT packed while the upper level was hustling. I've been on nights when I had to wait an hour even with a reservation and sat down with a full house all around and got better service at 7:30 versus a calm period at 4:30. 

For 155 dollars plus tip I expect the service be amazing.

28766,3,1547164800000,"Honey Pig!  HONEY PIG!
I have such a love affair with this place.  I'm at Pho So 1 twice a week so I have to drive past it, casting longing gazes for cuts of various meats, Barley Tea (""Chan""), and the savory sauces.  

The first time I saw the place/heard the name I laughed so hard at the ridiculousness of an establishment called ""Honey Pig.""  Nonsense, I declared!  (And how I've eaten my words...)

Honey Pig is a Korean BBQ chain that features the grill in the center of the table that you cook various meats, rice, kimchi, and whatnot to your specs, dip in sauce, and enjoy.  They are 24 hours, with all you can eat for lunch and dinner.  I personally consider them the best Korean BBQ for what Vegas has to offer.

Now I suppose if you're from Vegas or areas in cities where various scopes of nationalities and food cultures are everyday, like most of the locals here, going to Korean BBQ AYCE is just another function of the day, such as getting a burger or going to Panera.  I just love bringing people here who are very much meat and potatoes or my family who happens to be VERY Italian and VERY WTH-IS-THIS regarding anything that's not pasta and chicken and are casting a dubious eye to this establishment.  

This is such a great place to show off and be all, ""HAHA TOLD YOU SO"" because honestly, how can someone argue with you that they don't want to eat here or they're not into that kind of thing when the meat is cooking in front of you, all delicious and amazing?  It's introducing a different type of food without having to talk them into it.  Just get them to sit down and you're done.  (Okay, maybe they won't be all about the kimchi and whatnot but unless they're a vegetarian, they'll find something.)

This place also has a certain amount of quirky charm that I like.  The girls uniforms with their little bowtie and the rows of piggy banks on the walls added a sense of fun.  And major props to the waitresses, I might add, busting it all over the restaurant from table to table.  Imagine you had to cook some meat on a grill.  Imagine you had ten tables to simultaneously prepare and serve meat to?  Granted, the real-deal Koreans were showing most of us up, cooking and preparing it themselves, so they weren't quite the burden that most of us were, but those waitresses must leave there exhausted at the end of the day.  

The AYCE is stupendous.  STUPENDOUS I SAY.  It was just round after round of huge cuts of meat yet I was done by the seventh round, I couldn't do any more. This is a great place to come in a giant group and see who can keep going.  And the rice at the end, to cook it to the point where it gets a little stir-fried esque and is one of the best parts of the meal.

The one thing that made me VERY pleased was that the first three times I ate here was with two other Asians, one of which was a Korean (Olympian, actually..), and our service was kind of great.  I was -terrified- of what some others have suggested on here, that showing up by myself or with someone who wasn't Asian in my party, would I get the same level of treatment?  

Thankfully: YES, I did.  The service was consistently great every time I went, regardless of who was in my party, and the waitress last time personally thanked me by name after introducing herself and I couldn't have been happier.",2

The burgers are fresh and tasty and with the amount of options they have, it's easy to find something for everyone.

Price is a bit high but I think it may be substantiated because of the amount of food you get. Especially, if you order a side. Those are shareable for sure. For those complaining about prices go a half mile up the road and hit up burger king. 

I will say that I am continuously let down by the servers. Which is sad. The food is great and once a manager is involved, the managers ensure you are more than satisfied with your meal and service.

Shoyu and Tonkotsu come with two slices of pork belly, while the others come with one. Of course, you can add a few extra slices of pork for a small fee.

There is an option to choose thick or thin noodles, but they all seemed pretty thin to me.
Broth is great. Noodles also have a lot of flavour from sitting in the broth.

I can see why so many people would be willing to stand outside for a spot.",2
37722,1,1547856000000,"Considering my affinity for the post office is akin to a root canal, a four-star review is sayin' something!

I have a PO box here, and upon sign-up, the customer service agent took me to the box to 1) show me where it was in the rows upon rows of boxes, and 2) to make sure I, with my small stature, could reach it on the top row.  Much appreciated. I occasionally get mail for the apparent last owner of my PO box, and that appears fairly normal considering the random other pieces of mail sitting out.  They SHOULD have a PO box reject mail drop because it appears most people are just throwing that stuff away...

Once upon a time they had a great Asian BBQ sandwich that was raved about and helps encourage those that do not like typical sandwich shops to join. Unfortunately, that was taken off the menu and its hard to find a nice substitute for my boyfriend.

30329,3,1547337600000,"First of all, this is NOT a 4 or 5 star hotel as it is ranked on many travel booking sites. The rooms are nice, a little tired as some other reviewers have noticed. Fine for a 3 star but if you are really expecting more than that you will be disappointed.

Pros: 
*Easy to access location
*Friendly staff
* Decent sized rooms
*Clean rooms
*quiet rooms-easy to forget you were at the airport.
*Onsite store-pricey but good if you are snacky

Cons: 
*Parking is very expensive so if you aren't travelling on business (ie can't      expense it) and have a car, reconsider.
*They overcharge on room service. Yes, I get room service costs more but they add two separate fees not including taxes on top of the already grossly inflated food prices
*Want internet? It is free 50 ft across the road at the terminal but they'll charge $20 a day for it here. It isn't 2005 anymore Sheraton..stop charging for internet access.

Yep, you can eat healthy here (although I must admit...the garlic cheese bread and pastas surrounding you will make it difficult and call your name, tempting you to order them or reach over and steal a bite of someone's food!).  I think we have actually only sat at a table one time.  We always scoot on up to the bar to eat.  No wait, friendly bartenders and fast service right there next to soooo many good beers on tap.  The Oregano's favorite is MY favorite salad.  I always get it with chicken.  Hubby likes the classic chicken ceasar salad.  Both are always made fresh and not sure what they do to the chicken, but it melts in your mouth and is soooo delicious.  

Occasionally we will ""splurge"" and eat something outside the salad ""zone"".  If/when you do that, go for the garlic cheese bread with marinara sauce.  I could eat 10 of those in one sitting (even though it would be ""carbocide"" - hahahaaha!!).  The pizza is pretty good but I find it very salty.

30580,3,1547683200000,"Beware: Do Not Order the Shepards Pie unless you like food Microwaved for 10minutes+ 

I'm pretty shocked by the high ratings. I guess I shouldn't expect much from Vegas tourists.

Service: 3.5 Stars. Arrived at 830 Saturday night. Table of 8 sat before my table of 2. One waitress on staff and the host who became our waiter for the evening. Restaurant was not full.

Wait time for food: 1 star. 30 minutes passed  after we ordered and I was able to watch the kitchen serve 3 other tables. During that time I saw the kitchen heat up 3 different orders of their Shepard's Pie in the MICROWAVE... 10 minutes each, 2 of them at the same time and then one individually. Then pop them in the oven to brown the top. I was speechless.

I was shocked especially since we ordered Shepards Pie. We changed our order from the Shepards Pie and told the waiter why. I watched him tell the chef, and you could tell the chef was not surprised/embarrassed or did not care. Waited a total of 50 minutes. By then the restaurant only had 3 other tables seated. We contemplated leaving many times thru the wait, but tried to give the place the benefit of the doubt since all the yelp reviews. 

Food 2.5 stars
Wilbur's Gin Fizz -was interesting. Seemed a little weak, but easy to overlook. 

Glass of Wine -standard

Crispy Deviled Eggs- was good. Nice spice, little pickle gave it a nice acid kick. 

Shepards Pie- microwaved as standard practice. I asked the waiter if it was standard to microwave. He just looked at me in embarrassment and said he could change the order. 

Steak Frites-fries were good lol. Steak was a thin piece of really salty meat. Could only get thru a portion of it. And at 26$ it was really disappointing. 

Salmon- skin burnt black, by then we were already over the long wait so we just peeled it off and hoped for the best. Mediocre.  

Total Cost of meal: $84 and still added 20% tip because our waiter/host was nice.

There are a ton of great places to eat downtown and many of them wouldn't be caught dead with a microwave in the kitchen. It's shameful to charge $40+ a head for reheated food.

Next time you want something British inpired, go to Cornish Pasty. For Deviled eggs go to Carson Kitchen. They make everything fresh daily.",2

20791,2,1546732800000,"A beautiful meal on a beautiful day. Saw Wendy P's review and was instantly interested. 

It is very tough to find a decent BBQ place, most either try to use sauce to simulate the smokey flavor or overcook the meat. 

Holy smoke holds up to it's name very well. Had the pulled pork sandwich, pork ribs and the oh so amazing corn bread. 

The pulled pork comes in a dinner bun along with some cabbage salad, they complement each other very nicely. The pork is slightly smokey, moist and goes very well with any of the 15 or so sauces available (the garlic honey is especially good if a bit spicy). The salad gives it a good crispness and mellows the sweetness of the sauces.

The pork ribs can be ordered in any number you desire which is always appreciated. The dry rub gives good heat without ruining the natural flavor of the ribs.

Last but certainly not least was the corn bread. Eating this piece of decadent goodness sitting at the picnic tables in front of holy smoke on the first weekend of summer weather will stay in my memory for a long time to come. It was simply everything you think of for corn bread, light, moist and oh so buttery.

The decor may not be much and your meal comes on a lunch tray but overall, holy smoke is finger licking good.",2
20791,3,1547078400000,"I purchased a card that gave me 5 difference services, and to say the least - its been very disappointing.  I've had an express Pedi - which was lack-luster. Firstly, if you are going to be the person doing the pedicure, you should dress appropriately for the job. The nail tech was wearing a low cut, short dress, that she had to drape a towel between her legs to cover the 'view'. There was nothing that could be done for the top - but surely if you are going have customers looking down at you, you'd wear something that didn't fall forward. 

She also spent a good 10 minutes of the 30 minute Pedi looking for the bits and pieces she needed to do the pedicure. As I had made an appointment a week before, you'd expect they'd be ready for you. The leg massage lasted all of 2 minutes on one leg and 1 minute on the other. Luckily I'd taken my own polish as their selection was very limited. I think they had around 15 colors.

The girl doing my Pedi couldn't find the toe separators, so instead she used paper towel from the dispenser on the wall. The chairs are very uncomfortable and quite high - which was a problem when she left to let my toes dry and didn't come back. After 10 minutes I climbed out of the chair, then had to get back to floor level in order to remove the paper towel myself self and get my flip flops on.  When I got to the front desk, she was texting on her phone and talking to the other employees at the desk and looked like she had clearly forgotten about me. It was a bad first impression and experience. 

I thought I'd give them another try and use the hair cut option on my voucher. I called and made an appointment, and much to my dismay, when I arrived I got the same girl - my bad, I should have asked who the stylist was. But in my defense she never introduced herself the first time, so I wouldn't have known it was the same person.

My hair cut was worse than the Pedicure. First off - 1 1/2 to 2 inch trim, did not mean cut 5 inches off my hair!!  While my hair needed 5 inches cut off, it was not what I had asked for.  Second - I have long hair (very long) and after she'd finished the cut (which wasn't cut in sections, she cut all of it in one go) she didn't bother to check that both side were the same length.  I had to do that at home and trim it myself.  Third - after she put the styling product in my hair, she wiped her hands (to clean them) all over her clothes. I sat there wondering how many other people she had styled today and what germs and bacteria would now be transferred to my hair!  The blow dry was just as bad as the rest of the hair cut. She didn't take the time to clip up any of my hair, out of the way, but just brush it over the top of my head. This then tangled my hair and she used the same round  style brush to then try to get the tangles out which just pulled and broke my hair. This was while she held the still running hairdryer under her arm.

The entire experience was very unprofessional and I really have to wonderful if she was fully qualified as a stylist. Her actions clearly indicated she had very little training or experience or if she did, she was just plain lazy.

While the voucher seemed like a great offer as an introduction to their services, it hasn't enticed me to continue using them. If anything, it has ensured I won't return and suggest other steer clear of them too.  Very, VERY disappointing.",3

The Goods: 
-After we bought tickets we found a coupon offering them for less and the manager (not the register guy) refunded me my money and rang them up again under the cheaper price (ended up being less than $40 each!)

-it took $20 for our group to snag a very comfortable booth (and then the mate-tre-dee bought me my 2nd drink, ooh-la-la! )

Please save yourself some time and money and buy your fish ANYWHERE else! Don't believe me? Go play a game called count all the dead fish. Don't forget to notice the decaying ones sucked against the filters. 
I asked the boy who assured me he was one of the most qualified people in the store to talk about the fish,
 personally how many dead fish does the store haul out of the tanks daily. 
His response ""we clean out out tanks of the dead fish every morning and get somewhere between 7-22""
I nodded, then looked over and pointed a fish that turned belly up as we were speaking and told him he might want to get that one. 
Then I pointed out several in the tanks surrounding, then I pointed at all the filters, and there were more than halfway decayed fish. I also noted that if they did clean the tanks out every day, I didn't want to know what was in the water. (no seriously, they don't clean the tanks out of dead fish)
I pointed out that's probably why all my fish from there die within days.
He said, ""well surprisingly dead fish have very little effect on the other fish in the tank, even if they consume it

46113,3,1548547200000,"The Mugshot is my favorite spot in Toronto. Here's why:

-The staff rules!  They are super friendly, attentive without being smothery, quick with a pint, and go above and beyond to make everyone (including American tourists) feel at home.  

-The food rules!  Their barbeque pork sandwich is phenomenal (I grew up in Memphis, Tennessee, so I know a thing or two about BBQ) and I have actually considered booking a Porter flight from CHI to TO just to have their macaroni and cheese fritters. And the few times when I have felt the need to order a healthier meal, I have really enjoyed their salads and curry specials. 

-The drinks rule!  When I travel, one of my favorite things to do is sample the local beer offerings. And The Mugshot has local brews in droves!  Bonus: They always seem to have some kind of cool, obscure cask option. Double-bonus: If you're on the fence about a particular beer, the bartenders are great about offering up a sample taste.  Triple-bonus: Order ""The General""....just do it. 

-The people rule!  When I came to The Mugshot for the first time, I was a total stranger. When I left, I felt like it was my hometown pub and that the staff and the regulars were my TO family. I know the Cheers reference is totally overused, but it totally applies here, down to the sassy but sweet cocktail waitress and the bartender with the impressive head of hair!

-The location rules!  Right off the Keele train station, just at the end of High Park, within stumbling distance from 7-Eleven (in case you get a desperate late-night craving for Canadian delicacies like WineGum candies and All-Dressed chips).  If you're too impatient (or cold) for the train, it's super easy to hail a cab on Bloor. 

I love The Mugshot and I'll never make a trip to Toronto without stopping there for a pint  and a meal. My only complaint is that I need a passport to get to it!",2

24895,1,1547510400000,"I have reported this apartment complex to the Better Business Bureau. To start, during the 13 months I lived here, I paid a total of $325 in maintenance fees (at $25/month). Despite this fact, the maintenance staff was very hard to work with, and unbelievably slow. In my experience, they never left any courtesy note (or work order) advising when they entered, or provide any estimated time of completion, requiring multiple phone calls to the leasing office. They also never followed up by phone or by email. A ceiling fan, for instance, literally took 10 months to replace. Although the leasing office staff may seem attentive, the maintenance staff made it a horrible experience to live here. In the first week I moved in, the air conditioner started leaking over my washer and dryer (which was plugged in to the wall, and made me fearful of potential electrical shock.) It took 3 months for them to fix it, and they suggested using buckets during my wait. Even when I reported other serious issues, they would take a long time to fix, (like 6 months to fix damage caused by mice chewing into my apartment.) After moving out, although I left the apartment in a better condition than I received when I moved in, they still absorbed my full security deposit and charged me additional money for upgrades.

During my time there, here's what $950/mo paid for (for a 700 sqft, one bedroom apartment, and this price also includes water, trash, and maintenance fees): 1) a badly cracked refrigerator that heavily leaked, constantly leaving a large puddle in the crisper drawer making it unusable, 2) black widow spiders that regularly crawl under my door, and there was never any sign of any kind of pest control, 3) mice chewing into the walls of my apartment, 4) a painted, fiberglass tub that peeled and badly clogged the drain, 5) a leaky, rusty bathroom sink, 6) a stackable washer and dryer that barely washed clothes and took four hours to dry two towels, 7) a cracked, oxidized kitchen faucet that also leaks, 8) an old ceiling fan that barely spins and doesn't circulate the air, 9) badly hung window blinds that allow peeping toms to easily look in, 10) an old, analog thermostat with an unstable needle making it difficult to detect the exact temperature, 11) a leaky air conditioner unit, 12) an old door lock, that made me feel very uncertain every time Ieft my apartment. 

I'm sure you could find something way better for the cost of living here. Many newly-renovated apartments, in fact, even charge less.",2

You're also probably wondering, ""Why has she been stripped of her elite Yelper status???""  and you're likely also wondering, ""Whatever happened to that renegade peacock that escaped High Park Zoo??""

Well the truth is, I have a duty to my fellow yelpers to keep it real. And the reality is, I kinda stepped away from Home after I noticed my favourite treat's (the epic carrot cake) cake-frosting ratio had decreased (compare my pic vs other yelper pic).  I also noticed that some times the tart sizes drastically vary. Didn't buy em when they were super small.  I always feel bad walking out of a small shop so, often I'd peep in the window like the local weirdos and try to eyeball the cake-frosting ratio from afar.  

Now don't get me wrong, Home has the best treats in the area, and when you get homemade-style foods, they're not gonna be as consistent as a franchise vendor...but, the love...where's the love?? 

I never see Jenny the baker anymore.. she could still be there though, I dunno. I haven't been fortunate enough to get food on days where Jenny's magic baking fingers are present.  The cake was still good but again-- the cake-frosting ratio... :S  Also the small amount of frosting was super duper sweet. 

I DO recommend the quiche, the tarts, the cookies and the cupcakes. They taste GOOD... but sizes will vary...you've been warned.  And don't look at me like I'm all petty for caring about the sizes cuz if you're going to a bakery regularly its not to watch your weight--if you're just stopping by randomly then you will be impressed no matter what..

We drove down to this place late on a Tuesday evening close to closing and were pleasantly surprised to see a lineup of only like 5 people. I guess it helps that it isn't as centrally located as some other places. Big bonus here was free parking on the street. 

I was surprised at how fast the line moved. From joining the line to ordering was only about 5 minutes. I had the Taco Icecream (because why not?) and my fiancé had the half sandwich. 

I picked Cotton Candy (not sickeningly sweet so yay!), Black Raspberry Thunder (super refreshing and not too sweet at all) and vanilla (it's regular vanilla, no companies here. I skipped the whipped cream but got caramel sauce, sprinkles and kit kat bits as the toppings. It's definitely messy! But the taco shell comes in handy for scooping if you prefer that over the spoon. 

Our other item was the half sandwich with Pistachio Almond icecream and Grapenut icecream on a Chocolate Chunk Cookie. Personally we didn't like the Pistachio Almond, it was somehow salty but the cookie was soft and just chocolaty enough.

Toppings are fresh and local and hold up well.

Service was friendly and efficient.  If I could make one big suggestion?Assess the lighting situation and ambience. My guest commented it felt a bit like a hospital cafeteria.

My biggest disappointment came when I saw the chicken.  All huge chicken legs.......no white meat.  I would have  happily paid more for white meat had it been offered.  Unfortunately, I assumed that the chicken entrée would be assorted pieces.  As a result, we ran out of the roast beef because no one was taking the chicken.  There was a whole pan left.  Quite a waste of over $1000.00.  

I rarely write reviews but as the event was only yesterday, this is still bothering me.  My advice to anyone booking an event at the 100th Bomb Group is:  be sure to ask questions!  Don't assume anything!",2

Whirlpool in the tub. Busted. The hvac was busted when we got there. A technician came up and replaced a nasty filter which shot nasty modern dust bunnies everywhere when he changed it. The pull out bed had no sheets. When the sheets were supplied there was no comforter cover so now there are feathers everywhere. All the pool lounges had cigarette burns in them. The pool had a cigarette butt floating in it. A lot of the silicon is cracking which is crazy because it's not an old hotel. I just got kind of tired calling the front desk because no one would answer for a few minutes so I let a lot pass. Oh and the buffet at the casino was.....nasty. So to sum up. Looks great if you're totally wasted. Would probably make some great selfy Instagram photos but like a vegas douche bag it's a little ruff around the edges.",1

Cold fries with the burger.when spoke with the waiter about our issues and could we speak to the manager he said that's not how things worked and he would speak to the chef directly.

This place? This is where it's at. Especially for lunch. The sandwiches and bread here are delicious. It's so nice to have something so steeped in European tradition right there on Butler street.

20807,1,1546387200000,"We stayed in a GO room for Fourth of July weekend at a discounted rate for three nights. Our room was on the 28th floor with a great view to the south of the Bellagio fountains and City Center. I like that there is a refrigerator in the room and motorized curtains that you can control bedside. After the first night, we did not receive service to our room even though when we left, the cart was next door and they were providing service to our neighbors which speaks to the laziness of our housekeeper. The Spa elevators are convenient to the parking deck, pool, and to southern entrances/exits of the casino.

For the drivers, the parking deck is a mess. The later you get there, the less chance you have  of finding a spot. On the weekends, expect the deck and valet to be full if you don't get there early enough. On the upper floors of the parking deck there are some sections marked ""valet""  that guests can park so look for those areas if you're having trouble finding a spot.

The pools are a strong positive for the Flamingo. The GO pools are for the adults and the Beach Club pool is family friendly. Look for the bridge to cross over to the Beach Club pool where you present your key for entrance. Get there early to get your chair and enjoy a dip in the pool or take a ride down the two level slide.

I wouldn't recommend one restaurant in the hotel except Margaritaville to have a drink and people watch. Just put on the walking shoes because your center Strip location can get you to a nice restaurant in 15 minutes.

The poker room in Flamingo has always been one of my favorites. It's a great place to meet people from all over the country to chat and maybe have a shot or two. More importantly, it's a chance to win some easy money off an unsuspecting donkey or an inebriated player that can't see straight let alone make a smart decision.

I would have no issue staying at the Flamingo in a GO room again if we ever got the same rate.",2

When I walked in I waited in the area that said ""please wait to be seated,"" however the waitresses kept walking by my friend and I without acknowledging us. After around 3 minutes of waiting a woman came from behind the counter and gave us menus, and didn't say a word or seat us. My friend and I eventually got the message that we should seat ourselves, and ventured inside the restaurant. The waitress that came to take our order wasn't great either, she just took our orders and gave us our food without coming by to check on us. I was parched the entire time and desperately needed a refill on my water, however the waitress was nowhere to be seen for the rest of our visit. The restaurant was nearly empty when I went and there was really no excuse for the poor service. I've been to Santropol three times before and the service has been bad in the past, but after this visit I will definitely not be going here again. 

In regards to the food, it's just OK. A ham sandwich with cream cheese, lettuce, mango chutney, and a SMALL salad, should not cost 14 dollars. Period.

27147,3,1547942400000,"I had been waiting for this location to open for awhile to give it a try, including stopping several times before they were open thinking they were.

It seems like I got a bit ahead of myself on how good this might actually be. This isn't the super sandwich shop I was hoping for. It's more the Quiznos to Jimmy John's Subway. The comparison between JJ's and Potbelly is accurate as I feel they both want to present themselves as a more gourmet option to the Subway's and Silver Mines of the world, but really a just a new option on about the same level.

I had the italian sandwich here and while the meats are pretty tasty I didn't think there was much on their and it seemed greasy. The greasy feel was compounded by the fact that when I passed on mayo and mustard and opted for oil I got a sub drenched in it. I think with less oil the flavors of the meats would have come out more. I think the size of the sandwich was rather small as it was comparable in length to a Subway 6"" just wider and more bread. I do have to say the bread was quite good.

I am willing to go back and give potbelly a second chance as the price was reasonable enough that it is worth another shot. Maybe something else will be a more favorable sub.",2

Soon, our table was available and service was quick.  We ordered:

- Eggs Benedict with Avocado and Roasted Peppers - eggs cooked to perfection - poached soft was the style we ordered and that's what we got!  Love it!!  Came with these wonderfully roasted potatoes - nicely seasoned and not oily at all!  

- All in omelette - I was told that it was fantastic and packed with lots of meat.

I waited a few months to contact her again once I knew when I was going to have my engagement pictures done.  I have waited over two weeks and sent emails twice to set up a trial and have not heard back.  She posts several times on social media daily which is annoying when your waiting for a reply.

1. $4 for a normal taco is a little much.  I would have been more apt to buy my whole office tacos if they at least donated some of their over-priced-ness to the Humane Society itself!
2. Had the angus beef and chicken taco, neither had any seasoning on the meat and I saw the one gentleman opening a can of Rotel tomatoes to add as the ""salsa"".  Not my style.  They were bland and nothing that couldn't be made at home!

33230,3,1546732800000,"Thank you enterprise for ruining my day.  What should've been a simple transaction turned into a 45 minute nightmare where my husband and I were interrogated and made to feel like criminals.  I've been renting from enterprise on and off for quite some time.  Almost 5 years now I've been renting for vacations, family emergencies, car accidents, and as of late, basic transportation till I can afford a new vehicle to get to and from work.  But no, today you have lost a very loyal customer because being told, ""it's not personal,"" repeatedly while looking at me and my husband disdainfully does not sit well with us.

Neither is an exceptionally rude staff member who boasts of being in the company for 3 years yet questioning her upper management while out at lunch.  ""Well I don't know how they used to do things but they are not here right now and I am just doing my job.""  All you are doing is pissing people off by your callous attitude. 

Finally after verifying insurance, addresses, blood type, etc my husband was asked to sign the papers.  Again, more rudeness by her mannerisms and overall attitude and after everything still saying, ""I'm just doing my job.""  All I could say without imploding is that I didn't want to talk about it anymore and that I wanted to just get on with it.  

After checking the car, which was not properly cleaned, we were given the car.  I was not offered insurance through enterprise, I was not told the amount of gas in the car, and I was basically shooed away because we were done with.


Customer service, whether it be a a store, a rental place, a restaurant, is a big thing for me.  In my book, you can get away with a lot by just being cordial and having a smile.  Even when things are difficult keeping an upbeat attitude can go for miles.  What I experienced today was a shrew of a woman who didn't know how to handle anything with any kind of decorum.  We were made to feel like we were criminals trying to steal a car or something.

This is my last time going to enterprise.  You have lost my business, my respect, and my reference to all business and family associates I have to come to our destination city.  I would rather have my people take bus than deal with judgmental people who treat repeat customers with such behavior.  Again, I kept my cool as long as I could.

The caramel flavor of the butter and brown sugar comes through in every bite, the chocolate pieces are plentiful without overpowering the cookie, and that super soft center is so good.

The counters are chipped, there are huge holes where the sink plumbing goes into the wall, through which come bugs and awfulness, the carpets are uneven and ugly, there are giant gapped holes in those too that looking down into bug-infested between-floors, and various staples and nails stick up throughout the awful place for you to cut your feet on.  So yeah, these people are liars.  If that's not illegal, it should be, and these asshats should be strung up in public for everyone to see and cheer.

They are slum-lords and act like it.  The landlords do no repairs or renovation (see other reviewer's statement that they think a paint job is a renovation, completely true), but since the area AROUND them is slowly becoming gentrified, they think they can up the rent each year, and do.

Hah.  Hahahaha.  No I'm serious, they do literally NO repairs or renovation, but your rent jacks up every year like you're living somewhere fancy.

Oh wait, does cutting down the one nice tree count as renovation?  Then I guess they did that.

Also the people around there are scum, too.  A guy stuck a gun in my boyfriend's back when going down to get pizza once and attempted to rob him (boyfriend had emptied his pockets before going down just in case, so the thug got nothing), and that wasn't the first crime we encountered, so be wary of that.  They do have locking doors on the front of each building, but a lot of the locks don't work and most people just prop them open because there's no friggin' BUZZER OR INTERCOM to let you know if you have visitors, so you kind of have to leave it open.

Joe--the co-owner of the company, contacted me regarding my experience and we discussed options.  He compensated me for the replacement of my sheets and paint bleeding through some areas of the master bathroom by an arrangement of having the foundation of the home repainted.  I was in the market to have the foundation repainted since our neighborhood HOA notified most of the neighborhood about a mandatory repainting of peeling/faded exterior paint.

I inquired if that would be a possibility as an alternative since it was only the front of the home.  He worked with me on my request and did agree that the arrangement would be fair due to my past bad experience and damage to sheets.  As I mentioned before, I am impressed by them contacting promptly, the personalized care, and fitting me into their schedule quickly.",1

Even though there were plenty of seats at the table. ""We count people not seats."" It certainly didn't look full. The friend who had picked Wvrst thought it was like a regular place where, as long as you got a table, people in the group could arrive anytime. When I finally got in, the line for food was about 30 minutes long. No table service - you line up and order, then they drop it off to you... Another 20 minutes later. Luckily someone from our group was in line and ordered for me. I had crazy fries (I think that was the name) but missed out on the sausage fest since I didn't place my own order. Everyone in our group enjoyed the food, but the long waits were unacceptable in my opinion. They do have real forks (the fries are messy) but I had to ask for one because the wooden chip truck style mini-fork didn't cut it. The cider selection at the bar is good! They had Thornbury and Spirit Tree, and I didn't have to wait to order drinks. I would go back for the food but never again on a busy night.",2

It doesn't mean your food is ready. It means...well I'm not sure how to calculate what it means or when it will be ready. It means it's coming close to being ready. I did have some enjoyable conversation with others who also thought their order was ready. I think the volume of customers and the demand on the kitchen makes it difficult for them to keep up. I will admit that the food was worth the wait.

I had the double smoke burger. It was very tasty. I also had the shackstack concrete. I enjoyed it thoroughly. My wife had the single cheeseburger and a  vanilla milkshake. She received a chocolate milk shake and she didn't like the taste of it. When she finally got her vanilla milk shake, she loved it.

On another note, I've had really great service as well. A number of times, the cook himself would come out with a hot plate and deliver it to our table. I had the chance to meet the owner and he's really passionate about this business and the idea of fresh food.

It's a little pricey ($3+ for a small - and considering I'm used to going to the self serve places where I can get little bit of this and a little bit of that for like $1.50, $3+ seems like a lot) however the small is more-than-enough since it's so rich - wish they had a kid's size in fact.

Now this review may be biased due to the weeks of sushi-deprivation I had experienced prior to coming in...but the food was delicious!  The pieces were well-cut, artfully arranged, and you could tell the fish was good quality.  The best part of the night (aside from the great company) was the service.

39101,1,1547596800000,"""The library? Seriously?""

This is the reaction I always get when I list the public library system as one of my top three favorite things about Las Vegas. (The other two are the Neon Museum and the weather and the food... I know that is more than two. I just love so much about this darned town!)

Seriously, though, I love the public library in Las Vegas. I have a serious library addiction. At any given time I have at least 10 non-fiction books checked out, 20 on-hold, and some choice DVDs waiting to be viewed. 

The book selection is quite extensive, easily 3 times the selection of my previous Atlanta library system, and if they do not have it, my experience has been they are very responsive to suggestions. I sent an email suggesting a Buddhist text, and BAM! The next month it was in the catalog. They also have all of the latest DVDs. You will have to wait a while to get the most popular titles, but patience is a virtue, friends. Just today, I have to return ANVIL. Yes, the library had it!

The online services are quality as well. Searching and reserving is easy, and their online periodical searches are wonderful. I have been doing some research for a paper on Lady Gaga, and I was all prepared to go to the library, sit on a computer looking for periodicals and then slog my way through microfiche and stacks of magazines. Not necessary: there are literally millions of periodicals available to search online from the comfort of your home with full text available.

My local branch happens to be swank. Sahara West is a beautiful library, and I have always found the staff helpful. I rarely need the staff as the system is very user-friendly. They recently installed the latest check out technology, so all you have to do is pile your books on a desk, swipe your card, and the computer senses all of the items, and checks them out to you. I never expected to be wowed by technology at the library, but I was.

In addition to all of this, the library system hosts numerous events: art exhibits, movie viewings, author visits. For example, Thursday night at 6pm you can go watch The Hangover at the Rainbow branch. 

If you do not have your library card, you are missing out.",2

My brother had his birthday there in October. There were about 12 of us. We paid $25 each for ""family style' - a bunch of dishes for us to share. The portions were absurdly small. They served  four of us a small salad meant for one (as an appetizer). I took two leaves and realized I had taken too much! I had to put one back!. For the pasta's I had about three noodles of each. We all did. No one was happy. Everyone at our table thought It was a complete  a rip off. At least half the table went to McDonald's afterwards. 


My brother asked about the portions prior to booking and was assured there would be enough. When we complained to management about the ridiculous portions, we were told ""well what do you expect for $25"".

They tend to be off on pricing in the video game section, in both directions, but that means sometimes it's easy to find gold.

The stage is versatile. There are many moving parts to the lower stage.  It feels like a transformer, able to manipulate and insert many different parts. One stage goes down, and another comes up from the ground in a magical seamless transition.

I went into a CVS which later had a high quality digital system and the system scanned each photo to ensure it met proper guidelines. How a pharmacy/drug store has a better process is beyond me.

The last time we went in, we had a party of three and I'm pretty sure they forgot about our food because the owner and his family of 12 came in and demanded all of the server's attention (this was at least a year ago).

Today we decided to try it again and while the waiter was quick to refill drinks and ask if we needed anything, my lunch came out 10-15 minutes before his did. If I'd have waited for his food to come out, mine would have been cold.

Let me tell you first i work in the restaurant industry as a Chef so i have alot of give and sympathy when it comes to mess ups and waiting for food. 

However this was redicoulouse.  This little caesars is horrible! I ordered 1 order of crazy bread that is supposed to be hot and ready. Which they were not.. so I sat and waited. Bread can take no more that ten minutes I have time. I thought to myself. Fifteen minutes goes by and they serve about eight to ten people. Messed up orders or lost orders left and right there is no communication pertaining to the food or restaurant at all. They also lost a mans deep dish pepperoni. And another familys light sauce pizza. Obviously they are not ready for a rush because there was always a five minute wait on hot and ready pizzas.. At fifteen minutes I finally spoke to someone about my bread and the cook put an order in. And I watch it go thru and sit at the end of their conveyor for five to ten minutes while they talked and horsed around the kitchen doing nothing pretaining to their job. I finally got up and walked to the register and asked if I could talk to a manager and get my money back. Finally they say ooo they are up and almost ready.  The two cooks in the back are slow and have no idea what they are doing. I watched people touch their face or their phone and other things and I never once saw one employee wash their hands in the 25-30 minutes  I waited for my crazy bread. This place needs a new manager and new employees. The only bright light was the girl at the front taking orders Lindsey I belive. She took orders and was very kind to people.

The broth is rich and the noodles are always cooked to perfection. I work neaby, so it's a constant struggle to not give in to my noodle cravings.
The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff are always welcoming. This is the perfect spot to visit before, or after, a hot yoga session at nearby Bodhi Tree.

I blew a tire back on Father's Day on the way to the waterpark with my kid. I threw the spare on and was back on my way within 10 minutes. I went to a big chain and they inspected my tires. They told me that besides the one I blew the other ones don't need to be replaced, the tread was still on the green/yellow border, and they gave me a decent quote for a new tire that was comparable to my current tires. I had been contemplating replacing them all because when I did my own inspection I found many small cracks in my tires. I decided to get a second opinion, but a few days later my spare explodes.. 

I towed my car to Absolute Auto. I called them once the tow truck was there and told them that my car is on a tow truck and that I will be needing new tire/tires and that i will be there Saturday to talk about it. They said ok.

After meeting with them in person and inspecting my tires, they immediately said that I need a whole new set of tires. They saw that they were cracking and said if your other tire exploaded that these other ones are on their way! Unlike the big chain, these guys noticed the details and I felt more secure and safe already.

I decided to go up 2 rim sizes. Once I picked out my rims i asked for Arnold and (?)Chris' opinion, gave me a little guidance. Then they picked the tires for me which i had 0 involvement in. I hate picking tires, i just wanted something in comparable quality to the Eagle GTs i had, but a little more grip. My car is a little VW turbo and if i push the gas too fast (or barely at all), my front tires spin... i was never a fan of that and found myself launching at a grandma pace all the time to prevent burn outs.

I picked up my car with the new rims and tires and love it. Ive had it for a week now. It was flash flooding the past 2 days... i STILL HAVE YET to burn out. I can push the gas as normal a-ok and cannot believe how much it has effected the performance of my car. This was the easiest car experience i have had, and with such awesome results. I only had new tires and rims put on, but what I said i wanted to achieve, they nailed it. It makes me want to TRY and burn out just to see how far i can push those suckers lol.

My peplum top were $150 each and I was searching for a great place to get it taken in about an inch and others that I went to would just do a sloppy job and charge me a lot from my other pricy clothes. Habib took off the extra and made it look like I bought it right from the store and on top of that it was only $35! Definitely coming back in the future with any alterations needed.,2

I was first turned on to burritos made to order like this at a place called Edrito's Burritos back in Buffalo. Being that they have no Chipotle or to many other decent Mexican / Tex-Mex food in Buffalo, I was in heaven at Edrito's.

Found Zaba's out here when i first moved to Las Vegas. Wasn't until after being out here for couple more years that I tried Chipotle who seemed to be the main known place for this burrito style. ( I tend to avoid franchises and chains)

Onto my order today. Grabbed a steak burrito from here on lunch. All in all it was good but seemed to lack the flavor one from Zaba's does. Chipotle is a tad cheaper and has way more locations. This one today was busy but I was still in and out in less than 5 minutes.

So to sum up, if you like made to order burritos, I prefer Zaba's but Chipotle is good place to get your fill.",2

Tomatoes are also priced at $3.00 a pound even when the vendors' tables groan with them in August. New York's Union Square greenmarket is cheaper! Of course there's that airfare...

I go once in a while to buy zucchini, onions, and garlic and to get tomatoes from vendors who sell the ones with blemishes for $2.00 a pound or less. If you poke around you can find some bargains, but this is the most expensive farmers market I've ever been to unfortunately.",2

Then another customer walked and cut me in line. Then two people appear from the back to make items. Once the two in front of me finally reach finish there subs.  The employee walks away and says to wait on the next guy. This person asked me what I wanted then proceeded to start stocking sub wraps instead of helping me. I waited for over 25 minutes to just be acknowledged. I am super annoyed because I didn't even have enough time to wait on him finally finish stocking and make my sub. Because if I did I would be late going back to work. So I have to now wait 5 more hours till I'm off to eat. And that will be when most places are closed.,2

The styles range from Art Deco to Mid-century Modern.  This is the kind of place I have to avoid because I have a real soft spot for fantastic period lighting and it's an expensive habit, honey.  I end up falling in love with fabulous lighting and then trying to work it in my home.  If only I had a place for the gorgeous Murano Mid-century Modern baby blue and chrome ceiling fixture, it would have gone home with my on my last visit.

Don't expect bargain basement prices because you won't find them here.  The lighting examples here are the real deal and the prices are fair.

My only complaint is that the shopkeeper can be a bit brusque.  His people skills are lacking a bit, but the range of his inventory and the standout items more than make up for it.",2

You can also play some casino games on a monitor if you sit at the bar, which provided some cheap thrills for us at 25 cents a play.

I also like the creative cocktail menu. If you like fruity girlie drinks like me, I'd recommend the Basic Bitch ~ yum! But Velveteen Rabbit loses a star because of the cocktail prices. For a downtrodden area of town, I was surprised to see that the cocktails were ~$10 and up.",2

When we got in the car, we couldn't stop fangirling over how adorable she was and I told my daughter that she looked like someone who could finally do her hair!  My daughter had not had the nerve to go to a salon in over two years due to severe trauma at another place and had been chopping on her hair herself....... she also loves to experiment with color and is currently half blue...so, it didn't hurt to see that Jenna had amazing purple hair!  We made an appointment and went in shaking in our boots and terrified!  Everyone was very welcoming and nice so, we were put at ease although I was still about to have a coronary due to my fear of another incident of fleeing the place in tears.  From the second Jenna started talking to my daughter about what she wanted, I knew everything was going to be okay.  She really listened to what my daughter said and made some amazing suggestions.  I sat as worried and sweating as a whore in church while she cut and once she styled it and turned her chair around for me to see, I felt so relieved and redeemed that I actually burst into tears!  My daughter hasn't stopped smiling about it and vows to never let anyone but Jenna touch her hair.  Well, she did such an amazing job on my daughter's that I immediately made an appointment for myself.  Jenna made me look and feel like a rock star!

My first introduction was on a friday night ""date night""  with the hubby about two months ago we had already eatin dinner but wanted a night cap and we heard there was live music in the bar area, so we thought we would give it a try...We arrived about 9:30 pm and this place was packed!

So we looked around for a table to sit and saw one that was about to open and one of the girls that was working there welcomed us and said she would get that table set for us and she would be right over to get us started :)

With a couple of suggestions from Brittany K. our server we decided it would be a blueberry martini and a great glass of wine. Okay here is the greatest part the whole night, the bar is suddenly watching us when my drink arrives because this martini is served with dry ice in it and it is all misty and mysteroius and every one is like what is that.... my response is one of the best damm martini's and prersentation I have ever seen! So with that said this was the perfect way to end date night, great drinks, great service from brittany K, and oh yeah some great music from a live band... We loved it so much we have made it a point to go back and have dinner and of course for more cocktails...Dinner review below!

Okay so obvoiusly this place is renowned for its food and after having dinner I know why, from the start of our evening to the end of our dinner this place does not miss a beat and our server Chris Frazier like ""smokiing joe"" he said is a professional at what he does.

His suggestions for appetizers down to the main course to the heavenly butter cake at the end( which is to die for) were spot on....

We started with the shrimp cocktail and the presentataion and taste of this south of the border creation was truly the best we have had. For dinner my husband of course did the filet, like he always does when we go ut for dinner and I decided on the Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails...OMG these must of been the biggest tails I have ever seen, and they were amazing...Oh yeah the hubby said his filet was one of the bttere ones he has had which is saying a lot because he has had a ton of filets in his life, like I said that is all he ever orders :)

So we couldn't make up our mind of whether or not to have dessert but Chris our server said they have this butter cake dessert that will make you want to come back in just for that, and he was not kidding this is truely something every one should mark of their bucket list..AMAZING

Either way way we have been back in for cocktails and yes the butter cake and every time has been great...this place is on our radar and in our regular rotaion, what took us so long to go here, is the only question I keep asking myself?

So far it has been quiet, we haven't had any issues with crime (and we have modified vehicles so this was a concern), the grounds and pool area are amazing and the only bugs we've seen are ants outside on the ground where they belong. We can't hear our neighbors which is a huge plus. The only maintenance issue we had was taken care of right away and was pretty minor.

This location is the closest to my house and the strip and my craving was unreal so we decided to satisfy my hunger.

We are inside and the staff we super friendly, attentive, and fast. The food came out fresh and hot and it was my first time ordering the lemonade and it was so tasty and refreshing.

Let me start off by saying I am a loyal Raising Canes fan. I literally eat this during every lunch break since I've discovered it (I am not from LV and never heard of Raising Canes)

If I were to rate the food it would be 5/5 no doubt, this is my favorite fast food joint.

However, when visiting this East Flamingo location I was very disappointed and left upset by the rude ""customer service"" I had in the drive thru. I always go to the one near my workplace on St Rose and they treat their guest excellently. Well during my drive thru visit the lady helping us out had us repeat our order several times and then when we corrected her she would say ""that's what I said"" when she didn't... When we asked to substitute something she said ""no you can't do it"" in a snarky tone.. might I add that I've done it before at the other location. Then at the window she just came across as snobby and not wanting to assist us.

Never going back to this location.",2

The fries are amazing. The sausages are amazing. The sauces are...yes. The seating area can be a little loud, but otherwise, it's clean and bright and did I mention the sausages and beer? Because the sausages and beer are important.

But anyway, this is a nice cozy restaurant in shaker that serves very homey, tasty Hungarian food in extremely large portions.  The menu makes it seem pricey, but actually my girlfriend and I were both full after sharing a hungarian platter (schnitzel, stuffed cabbage, and paprikash) for $26 total.

I usually get the bruschetta pizza. It's a thin crust, freshly made pizza with cheeses, marinated tomatoes, olive oil and arugula. So good. I recommend it. The chicken pesto pizza is good too.

Sweating profusely, I walked towards the cashier and asked her what she recommended. She said the 'High Rise Burger' - without a second thought or glance at the menu, I acquiesced and ordered it.

The high rise burger ($10) was delicious although my senses may have been clouded by thoughts of the cashier. Succulent pulled pork piled on top of a fresh beef patty with onions and slaw. The beef patty was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of texture and juice. Tasted like being at a summer cookout in the backyard.

I came to learn that it was their first day ever at Walnut Wednesday and it is run by an ex-firefighter chef. Cool looking truck, yummy food and cute cashier. Go to Firehouse grilling co next time you see their truck around!",2

We called them back and spoke to the owner, and he told us that they couldn't pick us up, but that they'd have their airport privileges back in September and that we could use them again then.  We asked him how we were supposed to get home, since they called us at 7pm and it'd be hard to find another service on such short notice while we were in another state.  He told us that it wasn't their problem and then hung up on us.  As a result, we got stuck with a $65 cab ride home!

Do not have the chicken dumpling dish, it's terrible. The salmon and sea bass are just ok, have had better. The pork chile stew is quite decent and flavorful.

As others have mentioned, need a high clearance 4WD or AWD (I did it via AWD with no issue). And as Ashley B mentioned, the normally listed route in is a slow, bumpy slog, with the quicker/easier way in/out via access south of the Executive Airport (where the airport road, Inspirada, turns into Bicentennial). These routes can be easily spotted on Google Maps, especially on satellite view.

Even though an easy, short, flat-ish hike in, bring plenty of water since this is desert hiking: I went through almost 40oz of water in relatively cool, but sunny, weather.

Trail 100 is the fast route to the site (~2.2mi round-trip), trail 200, longer, more elevation, but has the advantage of avoiding the ""Indiana Jones and the Lost Ark sized rock"" blocking the trail (as a hiker I passed referred it as), scramble over, which might be a bit of scare to some.

Scroll to bottom of this link to see the routes over/around the big rock scramble:

It's nestled in a woodsy area with a cottage-like restaurant. I went a week before Mother's Day. I didn't have a reservation, so they had me wait and look around until they could seat me. They introduced me to the concept of the restaurant, the protected habitat that surrounded it, and what I was to expect. They were so sweet and the wait wasn't long at all. I looked around at all the books, charms, and souvenirs until they offered me a table. They allowed me to choose and I selected the seat facing a view of the trees. The menu was shorter this day, since the chef/owner was out. They had a lot of vegetarian and gluten-free choices. Their tea menu however, is very extensive. I've never seen so many choices of teas in my life! I went with an Angel tea and a vegan option of South Euclid Sanctuary salad with a side of strawberry vinaigrette. So here's where I'm blown away. This salad was the freshest, tastiest raw salad I've ever eaten and that's hard to do without having any sauces on it. When I added the vinaigrette, I was blown away even further. Look, nobody writes a review just because of a salad. But I kid you not, it was that awesome! It was extremely filling too. I could barely eat the dinner I had later. The tea they brought in with a spoon, sugar options and a little hourglass timer. When the sand has finished pouring, I was to pull out the tea bag. It tasted divine! Their service was impeccable and the décor was adorable. I went to their bathroom which had the same knick-knack décor as well.  I will upload pictures soon.

The bartender told me I was not giving her my order fast enough so she just took the next order in the middle of my own. I decided to talk to the manager about how rude her bartender was to me and my friend. She told me she could do nothing about what happened. She told me that they are very busy and her staff has to move fast. I let her know that I would at the very least like an apology from the bartender. She told me she can't do that because she can't ""Mother"" her and make her apologize. Eventually she offered to have the bartender talk with me. I again let the bartender know that as a former bartender myself, good customer service is essential for your business. This bartender had been taking my friends drink order all night long. For her to say that I was taking too long to order does not justify her behavior. When I served customers all night long, I pretty much knew their drink preference. I was very clear with my message to her and very precise when the manager of the club interrupted me and demanded that I ""Stop yelling"". It's a bar. It is loud. I was not yelling, however my tone was a bit sharp and my inflection was stern, but I was not yelling at anyone. I wanted my message to be received without misunderstanding. The manager continued to interrupt me while I was talking to the bartender. The bartender eventually did apologize, but I then had an issue with the manager insisting that I stop yelling.

I was impressed with the menu items and even though I'd consider most of them to be a bit expensive, they appear enticing enough to make the prices seem worth it.  I didn't have enough of an appetite to test this theory, so I just tried a Turkey Sausage Roll.  It was sizable and surprisingly flavorful.

Last year we started coming back and have had the best service every time. A few weeks ago we had server Michael (a very happy young black gentleman) around 7pm and he was absolutely spot on!!

Even when he was ridiculously busy with several tables he checked on us with lightning speed. If he had his hands full he would STILL pause and say I'll be right back with those cocktails for you folks, just to keep us updated that they were on the way. So many restaurants you wait and wait and don't know if they forgot about you, were just busy, or what the deal was, so this was really refreshing! What impressed me the most was soda refills without us ever saying a word, offers for replacement alcoholic beverages, and the fact that every single time he went back towards the kitchen he grabbed empty plates or glasses from our table or his other tables. I watch so many servers who mosey along and perhaps check in with their table but never clear it, leaving everything to the busers. He not only ran around bringing all this orders out to the tables, but you could see he was sizing up drinks and plates every time he went back too. We were in and out within a half hour.

We all chose a different entree and shared- Curry Duck, Orange Chicken, Crispy Beef and Crispy Oyster Mushrooms. The sauces were tasty without overwhelming and the textures/presentations really mimicked their ""real"" counterparts. The service was excellent considering it was a holiday. No wait for a table, food came fast and hot pleasantly served. We finished with the vegan cheesecakes that were served with a scoop of vegan vanilla ice cream. Delish! Already planning to make this an annual tradition on our visit to Las Vegas next Christmas.",2

We ordered a bottle of wine, crab appetizer, I had the Porterhouse and my wife had the Filet medallions. Our server was Rodrigo (sp?) and was very pleasant. We never touched the wine bottle as he was continuously topping us up. Now for the meal...
The crab was dry and overdone so we didn't finish it.
The steaks came, we both ordered our steaks medium. My wife's was perfect but mine was bordering on well done. I mentioned it to the server and he wisked it away for a replacement. The new one came...very rare...not wanting to complain again as I'd already done so twice, I just sucked it up and ate about half. The manager came by, looked at my plate and asked how I had ordered it. I told him medium but I didn't want to complain. He said ""my friend, that steak is blue, for $54 you should get exactly what you wanted"".
The bill came...only thing on there was the wine! I know kitchens can get busy and mistakes do happen, and because of the tremendous service we received, we will absolutely be back when we are in Montreal again!",2

25754,1,1546732800000,"Calling this a ""wine bar"" is a bit of a misnomer.  Yes, there is an extensive wine list, as well as other cocktails and even a reasonable selection of unusual bottled beer.  However, this is more of a gourmet pizza and small plates restaurant than an actual ""wine bar"".  The ""bar""  itself is pretty small and not separated in any way from the rest of the restaurant, which is overall tiny, loud, crowded and um, kinda ugly (white butcher paper covering cheap tables).  I guess that's the ""humble"" part as my usual ""wine bar"" experience is something elegant, quiet and maybe a bit snobbish that would not be so popular in a down-to-earth place like Lakewood. 

As happy as I am to have a decent restaurant centrally located in this strip of businesses - which have that miracle of miracles for Lakewood, an ample free parking lot (gasp!) in the back -  I wonder why the proprietor did not seek to place his business in an actual vacant bar or restaurant, or at least in a space that could accommodate a LARGE bar and be quiet and spacious enough that you did not have to yell across a three-foot dinner table at your companion to be heard.  This is not the place I'd go to enjoy a quiet, restful glass of wine or a drink of any sort. It's more on the order of happy hour in Ohio City. 

I still give it four stars because once you get past the noise, the uncomfortable tables, and your internal image of a ""wine bar"" as something much more peaceful, the food and wine here are top notch.  If your idea of a pizza is something with an excellent thin crust and ingredients that don't taste like they're loaded with sugar or came out of a can, then check this place out.  You can watch them rolling out the pizza and see that the process here is more akin to trained chefs than to bored teens throwing some dough in an oven. There are also awesome charcuterie and cheese plates where you can sample all sorts of tasty hors d'oeuvres, spreads, nuts, meats and cheeses, and a selection of fancy desserts.  The wine and other drinks are just the icing on the top of this most excellent cake.  The wait staff are more professional than the norm for Lakewood, and they even have a selection of pizza, dessert and wine available for takeout.  

Only reason I knocked off a star is the logistics of the dining room. As I noted above, during busy times it gets loud, crowded, and uncomfortable, and to make matters more annoying they usually don't take reservations and when you show up, if they are running a wait list, they have some policy of refusing to give you any idea of how long a wait you're looking at.  They can't even seem to tell you if you're looking at, say, 15 minutes or an hour. I imagine this is to encourage you to go wait in the bar and spend money on their wine instead of going elsewhere, but when the restaurant is crowded the bar is not a real pleasant place to hang out (no room and very noisy).  I would suggest looking through the large front windows upon arrival to see how busy the place is, and if it looks packed, go somewhere else.  If you see empty tables, by all means go on in there and eat and drink.",2

The variety of grilled burgers and sandwiches was creative; the descriptions made me want to try all of them. Atmosphere was typical of a sports bar: TVs were on, the games that weren't broadcasting with sound had CC on so you could read what was going on.

Cons: The staff seemed a bit inexperienced. I'm sure this will improve over time, as the location is brand new. As I was reading the menu, I found typos (plural of aioli had an apostrophe) and the biurb on the back of the drink menu about the restaurant could use some editing to clarify and make the story flow better.

Like tacos. Pink taco..now if that isn't a graphic innuendo, I don't know what is.

One might take it the wrong way. As in...is this a ""lesbi-honest"" kind of restaurant...or is it open to all orientations?

One might also upset a family from Idaho if you pass them in the halls while talking on your iPhone saying ""I SO want to eat a pink taco. Or maybe THREE!! Damn, I've been craving them ALL WEEK!!""

Settle down, people, it's a tex-mex taco joint. Take away the sleazy name, and all you've got is your standard mexican fare, where the only thing that's gonna get you hot and bothered is the hot sauce. :)

Anyway, so I order the pink tacos, because I rationalize that if they're going to name the entire restaurant on one entree, it must be the fucking bomb. Well, it was 'aight. I think it tasted better than it really was, because I was in town for a work convention and I was surviving off protein bars and almonds the majority of the time. You could probably just serve me refried beans in the shape of a taco, and I would have thought that was the best meal on earth at that very moment. 

But hey, I'm not complaining. It was way more affordable and much tastier than the convention center food. Not saying it's so good I want to come back kind of good, but it does the job, the servers are nice, and the place had a chill vibe.",1

At least it looks that way. The waiter came and announced that most of the dishes were already not available on the menu. My friend ordered a $14 salad that consisted of lettuce leaves sprinkled with cherry tomatoes. Really? It gets better. We order Eva's signature guacamole - let me just say, my neighborhood Lindo Michoacan Mexican joint makes guac that is 10 times better than Eva's. Dessert was also disappointing.

I think the quesadilla would have been better as chicken, the carne was a little chewy, but then again - that is the way some people prefer carne. The pork burrito was excellent and the enchiladas were top notch also. I skipped the chips and salsa since they were an added few $ - Im glad I did because the rest of the meal was filling.

I loved the flavor of the rice as well as the beans. I wouldn't really call them the best ive ever had though; we do live in Phoenix. The rice and beans capitol of the world if im not mistaken.

It's decent, average, ok barbecue. It's not bad at all, but it's not great either. 

The meat was relatively dry but they offer plenty of sauces. In other words, don't order brisket (which we all know doesn't take sauce right?!). 

The sides don't taste particularly homemade. But they got the job done.

The sauces seem to get a lot of praise. I agree the sauces were pretty solid and there was decent variety. But you can buy bottles of sauce and eat anywhere. Sauce alone should never inform your entire opinion of a place. Unless it's a sauce store I guess..",2

I feel like it would be more profitable for them to offer their full menu up until the kitchen closes.  Their beer is great, and you can tell it's fresh from the cloudiness that appears in the beer when it pours into a glass. All the beers are full of flavor. This past visit I was a little disappointed though, because I called before hand to see if they would have certain specialty beers available that were only set to be served that night, and when I went there, they were all out.

Le poulet était tendre et savoureux, mariné dans une belle sauce crémeuse. Le meilleur plat était de loin le bœuf Madras, préparé avec des cubes de viande mariné si tendres qu'ils se coupaient à la fourchette. Il s'agit d'un plat relativement relevé.

41722,2,1547251200000,"The last time I was at the Flamingo was in 2012, and I had a bad customer service experience and decided to never use that hotel again.  I decided to try the Flamingo again because we were traveling with friends with children, and felt that they would all enjoy the pool.  I should have picked another hotel.

When we arrived at the hotel at noon, we were all eager to hit the pool.  The front desk informed me that if I wanted to check in before 4pm, it was an additional fee of $30!!!  I asked if my room was ready and they said yes, but unless you pay the additional fee you cannot check-in until 4pm.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I have only heard of this at one other hotel.  I could not believe after paying the nightly rate, and $30 per night resort fee, they wanted another $30, so that I could enjoy their resort and start having fun on my vacation.  If you want a late check out it's another $20 per hour additional fee.

The Flamingo is located in the center of the strip, walking distance to many strip attractions and show.  It's across the street from Caesar's Palace.  Parking is free.

The Flamingo has restaurants, shops, a very nice pool, a gym.  There is no business center but they have several pay to use computer kiosk throughout the hotel.

The fitness center is at the spa and is open from 6am to 7pm.  There are 3 different pools, the main pool is adults only.  They have the beach club pool for families, which is just a standard pool, and they have a water slide pool.  The pools are open from 9AM -7PM (in the summer) except for the slide pool, which is only open from 11am -5pm.  One of the negatives is that they allow smoking at the family/kids pool, second-hand smoke is the last thing I want my kids inhaling when they are trying to have fun at the pool.  Make sure you bring your ID when you go to the pool, not sure why, I asked 4 different security personnel and lifeguards, none of them knew why they have to check for ID.  They don't ask for a room key to confirm you are a guest at the hotel, just ID?!?!  You cannot bring any food or drinks into the pool area, even items that you bought in the hotel or hotel restaurants.  They will not let you in, you have to purchase everything from the bar/snackshop inside the pool area.  The drinks and food are very expensive and not worth the money.

Our newer ""GO"" room was small to average in size.  It had a sort of retro 60's decor, with marble counter tops.  It was clean, but maintenance could have been better.  The walls needed painting and the mini-frig was dented. It had a spacious closet iron/board, medium size flat screen television with cable channels and PPV for $13.  It also had a stereo system, coffee maker, mini-frig, desk and chair, and a room safe. The resort fee included WIFI for one device, and the signal strength was good.  The bed and pillows were comfortable.

The bathroom was medium sized, with a walk-in shower with multiple shower heads, a separate tub, a marble sink, and a television in the bathroom mirror.  The bathroom was clean and also included a blow dryer.

Overall this hotel is not bad.  Before a negative customer service experience in 2012, I had stayed at the Flamingo for 20 years.  Ever since the Harrah's and now Caesar's Properties have taken over they have gone down hill. The very annoying part is that you never feel like a valued customer, but rather just another person who the corporations want to continually up-charge for basic items that are free at other hotels.  I would have given it 3 stars, but because of all the hidden fees it's going to be 2 stars.

The Cobb salad was perfectly prepared, albeit a little boaring (lame pun.). I blame myself for ordering a SALAD at a GAME restaurant.  The carnitas taco was succulent, moist, a little gamey with shredded cabbage, charred tomato salsa and chipotle cream--YUM!!!

Although I couldn't finish either dish I ordered, I had a moral imperative to order dessert...the Nutella Boar Bacon Sundae.  It had rich, vanilla bean and Ghiradelli chocolate, Nutella and boar bacon crumbles.  It was decadent with the smoky, salty punch of the boar bacon, although I would have liked the bacon a little crisper or in a bacon brittle (it's a texture thing...)

The exclamation point on this extraordinary meal is the bill.  A margarita, entree sized salad, two carnitas with a side of black beans and a fabulous sundae for dessert came to $32.45!!!  Everyone on the Phoenix area needs to try this place immediately.  The service is fantastic, the decor is simultaneously warm and modern and the food must be tried--again and again!",2

36304,3,1548115200000,"This Michaels is my friendly neighbourhood store. Staff are definitely friendly. I can't say that all customers are.

Sometime last year, I drove to this location and backed into a parking spot. There are plenty of parking spaces. It wasn't a stressful evening. However, an impatient woman was not thrilled that I spent an extra two seconds to back into a spot. I am a decent backer-upper when it comes to parking. She honked at me. She managed to swing into a parking spot rapidly after I got out of her way and run into the store. Talk about dashing for craft supplies.

Last week, I visited this store. I got out of my car and closed the door. In doing so, my work photo ID card attached to my pant pocket pulley (say that fast!) got caught. I had to unlock my car and open the door. Meanwhile, I was taking up some seconds for the gentleman parked next to me to get into his car.

He did see me get my work badge untangled. I apologized. He smiled and said that it was all good. That made my day for being a klutz.

I was there to check out patches. I was wearing a pair of corduroy pants that I love. I managed to tear the area just above my left knee. I did some investigation on how to salvage my pair of pants and browsed around the store.

I have often come here for sewing and calligraphy supplies, fabric dye, as well as stickers for when I went on a cruise and had to decorate my cabin door for a contest. Ah, good memories.

I like this store. I am hoping that friendlier shoppers continue coming here.

Also, It seemed like some sort of big shot from the restaurant came to greet the people sitting in front of us and ignored what was going on at our table. I say BIG SHOT because the chefs and kitchen staff kept coming to him about things but he was oblivious.

Latte Art: Cortado is not really a drink to show off latte art but there was nice design in place
Milk: N/A such a negligible amount that one can't judge it fairly

36894,1,1547337600000,"A friend and I stayed here from 19/19-10/23/17. On the positive side, we thought the room was clean, and there were a number of places to eat. The location is great -- right at the beginning of Fremont, which makes it convenient to walk down this famous street and gawk at the sights (and there were some weird sights to see, given that Halloween is so close). Also, we enjoyed the Blackjack there, mainly because of our dealer Nat, from Thailand. She was most helpful. Another dealer named Filipinan was also nice.
On the negative side, we thought the room needed a luggage rack, more towel racks, and more outlets for electrical devices. When taking a shower, I ended up with water mid-calf because of poor drainage. When the light was turned on in the bathroom, there was a loud sound that would sometimes stop, but more often would continue until the light was turned off. The air conditioner was dirty and a bit noisy.

I also tried the coconut macaron. It did not match the awesomeness of the cupcakes. The shell was chewy. The filling felt like marshmallow fluff (I guess it was an Italian buttercream?).

Service was attentive, waitresses were always coming around to check in and refill water. Ordered a large sashimi boat ($60) to share as a group of 3. I thought the price was reasonable given that the sashimi slices were decent in size and fresh.  

We also ordered a seafood pancake appetizer. I would pass on this, as it was mainly an omelette with random pieces of seafood. Also ordered a beef bibimbap, it was good and filling, but otherwise pretty generic.

34871,1,1546992000000,"Hi fellow foodies!

Lees is a great find but be warned..... CASH ONLY!! 

Although they do have an ATM machine inside with cheap fees it doesn't always work.

As you wait in line to order there are shelves of Asian foods on each side of you.

So many interesting things to look at keeps you entertained while waiting

Since they seem to always be baking it smells heavenly from the wonderful breads to the soft flaky delicious crossaints and beyond!

It is a must to try one different pastry each time to experience the culture!

I cannot go on enough about their pastries!! AMAZING!!

The sandwiches are a culinary experience that's takes you on a mouth watering tour.

I like the combo on baguette ... Thereis not a ton of meats but enough to satisfy and you can always order double meat for cheap

The sandwiches are less than $5.00 and are on a soft crusty delicious fresh baguette or you can opt to have it in a crossaint so ordering double meat for those who are super hungry still makes it a very reasonably priced meal!

Also tons of drinks to choose from be it Thai tea to coffees to cold drinks and  they have fresh sugar cane drink which as you can imagine is sweeter than I can handle... But was fun to try.

There is ample seating and the place is always clean!

They decorate for holidays and when you walk in the door you feel the welcome!

I am a harsh critic but I gotta say.... LEES IS A MUST TRY RESTAURANT...  And as we all know from my reviews.....It must be something special for me to rave....

Something for everyone!

So in closing..... Remember to take time to stop and smell the roses... Life is too short!

22040,3,1546905600000,"It's been a loooong time since I visited Jack's for bar night; this review is about their Sunday brunch.

We tried to go to Jack's a few weeks ago for Sunday brunch, and we got there at 10:35 since their website and Facebook pages both said they open at 10:30.  We got there and the hours on the door said 11:00 a.m. Sunday.  Argh.  Consistency in publicizing hours seems like the easiest thing a restaurant/bar can do, so that stuck in my craw, especially since I was starving.

We went again today - at 11:15 - and the place was about halfway full.  Our hostess and waitress were nice, the food selection was great and the prices were almost too low for what you get.  I ordered the Hungry Jack - two eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes AND pancakes for $8.99.  For all that food, I would've expected to pay a lot more!  Fella got the Chicken Biscuit, and I think it was an entire fried chicken with a fried egg on a biscuit; it also came with taters or grits.  

All in all, a good experience, but I just felt like I was eating breakfast in a bar that the nightly attendees had just stumbled out of a couple of hours before.  I love Jack's as a bar, but as a breakfast restaurant, it's still dark and dingy with nighttime bar music playing, which just isn't my favorite on a Sunday morning.  For my money, their other joint - The Peculiar Rabbit - is a much better brunch option.",2

We were the only ones there at first but the place filled up quickly after our arrival. The owner was extremely outgoing and friendly, going out of his way to explain the menu and Taiwanese culture to us in lots of detail. He enthusiastically told us he was trained by a local celebrity chef in Taiwan and showed us the recipes she had published in a magazine. Our conversation really piqued our curiosity and by then we were impatient to sample his cuisine. 

It definitely did not disappoint. The menu is half Taiwanese and half Japanese. We tried the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, which consisted of perfectly al dente udon-like noodles chilling in a deep, rich beef broth; the heavenly Taiwanese minced pork rice, which tasted like it had been simmering in its juices for hours; crispy Japanese almond shrimps; sweet and sour deep fried fish, and some kind of chicken katsu, although the sauce tasted a bit more like teriyaki than the traditional plum sauce. Everything was fresh and flavorful, and the fried food was surprisingly not oily at all. I personally preferred the Taiwanese dishes because it tasted like the kind of home-cooked meals you yearn for once you've left the family nest, but I must admit the fried dishes were very well executed and would delight any tempura fan.

We finished the meal with a sample of the pancakes that are only offered on weekends: taro, sweet potato, custard and red bean. It was the perfect end to a very enjoyable lunch.

39679,1,1546732800000,"Lovely decor. Food excellent although way too expensive for lunch fare: paid $18 for a single medium sized tentacle in my octopus salad. Service was good and improved since opening. As correctly mentioned by others, they charge $2 per person, for filtered water, and there is NO tap water available. Staff felt quite awkward mentioning this. On principle we boycotted drinking any water. I am not convinced this policy will last - water arrives in decanters - I certainly didn't see this fancy filter at work. 

I was told they are working on a lunch menu. We will see... spending $60+ for lunch is not a regular activity for me.",2

It's a UPitt classic but sorry I don't have a taste for it. I recognize it for what it is. A grease pit. The staff working there is saintly, I couldn't imagine dealing with their customers late at night/early morning. 
The one thing I do like about the O is their fries. They literally pile a container with fries, dump it in the bag, and then give you a another huge container of fries on top of that. You end up taking a half of a bag of fries home with the paper bag soaked in oil. I wouldn't sit down and eat there because you probably want to dress up the fries with something - by themselves they are a little plain. But hey, they're super cheap and can feed a family of 4.",2
43274,2,1548547200000,"I think the best way to review this place is in context.  

Let's say it's 3 AM and you are leaving a Lakewood bar, or getting out of a late party, or just up and about and wanting pancakes.  But you know from experience and inate common sense that Denny's is sort of revolting and Perkin's is filled with old people.  So, you want some decent food, that's not too far away, in an environment as low on douchebaggery as possible.

This is a good time for My Friends.  They do the basics of 24 hr breakfast food pretty well, an OK job on some of that other crap you decide to try once and a while (sandwiches, gyros, etc.), and actually have some really tasty desserts in the case (try the rhapsody torte if you can).  I think I recall they have good potato pancakes too.

The environment is decent, the service is at least on par with their late-night competition, and there's some winners on the menu.  Compared to 24 hr chains this is your best option, but I wouldn't go here during day hours when you can have better, unless it's to stop in and get that rhapsody torte thingy.",2

24321,2,1548201600000,"Don't know if I'm the best person to give a review because I am not that familiar with Mediterranean cuisine! I thought I would be adventurous and try some new food. I am of course a big fan of gyros and have tried quite a few places in the area. I tried the plate with hummus, falafel, green salad (already forgot name of) and lamb skewer. I loved the hummus right off but I was familiar with that, and that's kind of where the love ended. The green salad was very strong flavored, I tried to eat it but just could not, did not like the falafel either, I wanted to because I heard they were good. I did like the flavor of the lamb skewer but way over cooked! The pita was good, but did not stay soft but still liked it with the hummus! My hubby had the gyro with fries, he liked it and the fries were very good! I guess I will stick to what I know and if we return will definitely get the gyro! So in short go try it yourself as all taste are different, it's a very nice restaurant we were the only couple in there, for lunch as we were leaving one more couple arrived. The young lady who waited on us was very attentive and helpful.",2

I recently ordered take away from this establishment.  The phone experience was rough at best.  So I went to the restaurant expecting there to be errors in the order, but it appeared to be a-ok.

I stood at the bar trying to grab the attention of the bartender to pick up my carryout order, but nope, she was glued to some Chinese language television program.

Truly a waste of money as it was so watered down you could barely taste the coffee. The cups were filled to the brim making it basically impossible to carry them over to our table without spilling on ourselves. 

All in all the service was poor, the eating area was dirty and there were several tables that didn't get cleaned during our visit. Would not recommend and will not re-visit.",1

31910,1,1547769600000,"Arrived promptly at 8:15 PM for my reservation and was told they were clearing a table. Had to wait for about 10-15 m while this supposedly occurred. Sort of s long wait when you have a reservation I thought. Once seated, we ordered two apps, the Mac and cheese and deviled egg of the day. Deviled eggs were good, but we're not homogenous my filled. Some were pretty light on filling while others were over filled. I was surprised at the lack of care taken in the presentation. The Mac and cheese was delicious however. Upon completion of the apps, our server gave the spiel about specialties and promptly forgot part of the description. We ordered the short rib and Shepard's pie. Both were very tasty and I would order either again in the future. We also ordered Cheddar biscuits, which were really good too. They come with Apple butter not regular, and it was very strong tasting (personally I am not a big fan of Apple butter but those who enjoy it would probably like theirs). Dessert was the apparently popular home made deconstructed smores. This was tasty but messy. The chocolate covered bacon was good, but large and overwhelmed the other components. Still tasted good over all though! Price for two with red hen beers was $90 without tip. Overall, our waitress was sub par, not very friendly, lacked full knowledge of the menu, and reacted strangely to standard pleasantries. She sort of stared without replying when we answered her questions. However the food was quite tasty, better than many places I have been but not the best I have ever had.   That gives it a 4 in my book and I would return and recommend to others. However I think Citizen Public House may be my preference for a similar type of meal and far better service.",3
31910,3,1548374400000,"I was really disappointed with my Stripsteak experience. I made the 5:30 pm reservation about 2 weeks in advance. I let them know it was my bday. We get there and had to wait about 15 minutes before we got seated (when we got in, over half the tables were empty...) Whatever - thats fine. I got a little happy bday card from them and the waiter was really cool at first. Then I let him know we had a restaurant.com certificate and I don't know but I feel like maybe it went all downhill from there (not sure why they would be upset with this bc they still make the same tip amount if we didn't have the certificate.)

We got the duckfat fries. They were mediocre. So many people raved about these fries and I just didn't think they were anything special. They actually came out room temperature and seemed over cooked. I would have rather had some bread.

Then we ordered. My boyfriend ordered the Gold Label Kobe NY and I told the waiter that I wanted the Kobe Rib Eye and then the waiter convinced me that I wanted the Kobe Rib Cap. I said that I wanted something super tender and buttery and he said definitely Rib Cap. We both ordered our steaks ""medium."" We also got a baked potato and the bacon creamed spinach. I asked for a wine that went well with my steak and I said I normally drink white sweet wines but i would do a red wine if he could recommend one. He didn't know anything about wine or he was being sort of condescending towards me bc I said that I never really drink red wine. I dunno. I just got a glass of riesling. 

The food came out rather quickly - maybe thats because they barely cooked our steaks!! What the hell - they both came out RARE ( we ordered medium.) And this rib cap I got - it was super chunky and chewy and bloody - just not what I wanted at all :(  My boyfriends $85 steak was a bloody massacre. The inside was just pure mush- you couldn't see any grain in the meat at all. My bacon spinach was almost too bacony- I LOVE bacon but the flavor overpowered the spinach. My boyfriend said his potato was good though and the sour cream that was served with it was delicious. 

Since I saw peoples' bday desserts from Yelp photos, I was waiting for them to bring me an ice cream or something. They didn't, so I just ordered off the dessert menu - I got the Dunking Donuts- since our meals sucked, I was relying heavily on these donuts to make up for it!! These donuts literally took about 30 minutes to bring out - this took longer than the steaks lol. They wrote happy bday and I got my candle then we ate the donuts and... they were ok but I would have rather had Dunkin donuts or krispy kreme!!! When we ordered the donuts, we asked if they had vanilla (instead of the caramel that went with it) and they did. He asked if we wanted to swap it and I said I'd rather have just one caramel and one vanilla scoop. Who knew they would charge $5 for the little tiny scoop that was smaller than a teaspoon and that we demolished in one bite. lol. 

So then we get the bill - $286.... yeah. thank goodness for the certificate we had then it came out to $236. We didn't even order appetizers!!! They charged $24 just for water. They charged $12 for the little donut things plus the freakin $5 for like the smallest scoop of vanilla ice cream I've ever had in my life. This place is a rip off. We have no problem paying $300-$500 for a fabulous dinner experience but this one was far from it. There's hundreds of better places to eat in Vegas.",1

I got the banana chocolate chip waffles and it had just the perfect amount of sweetness. My dad got the hamburger which he enjoyed as well. The prices are reasonable as well. 
We parked in the The city centers parking structure, because I read reviews that MTO validates parking. What I didn't know is that they only validate $1.50; and the total was $3, so we had to pay $1.50 for it, which isn't bad, but I was little taken a back since I thought it'd be free.

21067,1,1547856000000,"I dislike fast food for the most part. Every Burger King and McDonald's can go fall into a chasm for all I care. 

But I must say that Wendy's has pretty good burgers. The fact that they aren't frozen helps. I prefer the 1/2 Lb. Double Cheeseburger with everything, by the way. They also try to have an expansive menu that hits the target sometimes but also misses a bit.

My opinion on Frostys (Frosties?): They  are best after they've been in the freezer for a couple of hours and then eaten with a real spoon, not a plastic one. 

However, the service at every Wendy's seems to be seriously lacking. We've only ever gotten drive-thru at this location, and they always forget something or make an error. The staff also appears to be overstressed and overworked and surely underpaid. 

This is one reason why I favor living wage legislation: Higher wages=better service.",3

For less than 20 bucks you can get soup, salad, vegetables, rice and your main entree (just chicken for only $15!). I would recommend the filet mignon and maybe the scallops. This is probably one of the only places where you can have the option to pick fried noodles or fried rice.",2

If you're looking for a plate full of slopped pulled pork or some brisket hidden under a sauce and sides to feed an army you may want to pass on the artistry being created by Chef Cullen. Our server Michelle was amazing! Not only did she know the menu in and out but she really had a passion for what was on there! It's always refreshing to see a servers eyes light up when describing a dish, and actually be invested in what she was talking about! I highly recommend asking for Michelle, you will not be disappointed!

Now to the food! These will not be big giant feed your face plates, you are going to get a serving of some real passion and love of flavors, a southern background mixed with some Italian flair. It may sound daunting but please please try it and see for yourself how great a combination these two can be! 

Stacked salad to start, of course not a tradition Caesar but the flavors are robust and delicious and the corn bread croutons will make you never look at a normal crouton the same!  

Verde focaccia to share, excellent use of goat cheese, you get a good flavor but not over powering mixed with the pesto was on point! Crust was cooked perfectly nice and crispy but wasn't over done. 

Pimento burger to my self! I have to say I've had this burger numerous times I can't seem to get enough of this. Excellent flavors; the homeboys comeback sauce, the pickles, pimento cheese all mixed in to each delicious bite after bite. I would definitely recommend this to be one of the best burgers in the valley and would put it up against any others you might hold near and dear to your heart.  

Overall you can tell the creators have a pure joy of food making this a very special spot in Phoenix, please go and try it! Be open minded don't get stuck thinking you can only have one plate a certain way liven up your tastebuds!",2

It took 15 minutes for our first scoop to show up and another 5 minutes for the second scoop. 
And at the end of it all, while the ice cream was unbelievable smooth (Dairy Cream smooth but as dense as ice cream from a tub) it was flavorless. (I had salted Carmel and the other was cookies and cream)

If you land there prior to 10pm, there is nothing to eat or drink in the main part of the airport (where you grab your bags) so grab whatever you need when you exit the plane.

44994,2,1548115200000,"I have been to Cibo twice in the past two months. Both times the service has been friendly and well timed. However, the food leaves much to be desired. 

The first visit, I was with one friend and we order two appetizers,  a pasta, a pizza, and two desserts. We ordered the arancini and a trio of scodellina (bruschetta, golden beets, buffalo mozzarella). The arancini had good texture but lacked in flavor. The beets were the highlight of the trio, the mozzarella was OK but nothing special, and I would not order the bruschetta again. The bread pieces that come with the scodellina seem to be store bought, the kind you get from the grocery store deli in a cardboard box.

We ordered the farfalle as our pasta because we heard it was the best pasta. Disappointed does not begin to describe it. If you went to the grocery store and bought some pre made rotisserie chicken, a jar of pesto, and a box of farfalle , it would probably taste the same. The biggest disappointment was that the pasta was so clearly not house made and mass produced, and over cooked. Doesn't matter how much cheese you put on it, you can't hide subpar. 

The pizza was slightly better but not by much. We ordered the pineapple, again, best reviews. You would think that you could actually taste the pineapple since it was the name sake, apparently not. Upside is the crust is tasty and cooked well.

At the end of this meal, we were not planning on returning again, but we decided to order some desserts and drinks because our conversation was not over. Best idea ever. My friend ordered the goat cheese panna cotta (she thought it was phenomenal) and I ordered the zeppole (mouth wateringly delicious).

The dessert is why I returned with friends a second time, on a Friday night. The plan was a late night meeting of drinks and dessert. However due to our busy schedules, we were more  hungry then planned so we decided to order some appetizers. Again we did scodellina (prosciutto melon, beets, and eggplant) and arancini. Congrats on being consistent- will not order the arancini a third time, if I return again. The selection of scodellina this time was better, but bread pieces were still from a box.

For dessert we ordered the tiramisu, coconut panna cotta, and red velvet cake. The panna cotta was light and flavorful, the cake was dry and not exceptional, and the tiramisu ok but could have a stronger flavor.

If you want good service and nice atmosphere,  come here. If you want good and quality food, try somewhere else...or just have the panna cotta and zeppoles.",2

35638,3,1546905600000,"Came last weekend after hearing what an anomaly it was to have a Casino right in the heart of Cleveland.  I figured it was a must see, so my bf and I stopped in after dinner. 

The casino itself is beautifully crafted, with fun odes to Cleveland and Ohio in general, but also a luxurious Vegas vibe with well lit bar and VIP areas, stages, and more.

Gambled a little and wasn't having much luck... the slots were no where near as loose as other Casinos I've been to in San Diego.  Maybe I am used to that vibe, because I really didn't hear a lot of ""fun stuff"" going on.  They had a promotion drawing for electronics and the announcer sounded bored over the speakers. Oh well...

My bf and I signed up for their players card, at most casinos we have been to (other than Vegas Casinos), signing up for a card will offer some type of free play or promotion.  Not here.  The lady taking care of us promised we would receive emails about these types of things...but being that were were only visiting it didn't matter. 

We still made the best of looking around and playing a bit. I thought it was pretty cool to have a casino in the happening part of town, as most casinos in San Diego are on reservations out in the boonies. 

I've experience better mostly because, I did not appreciate getting grilled at the front door because of having an out of state ID.  I do realize that it is their job and the integrity of their casino rides on making sure no one underage gets in, but instead of scanning my ID, the lady in front felt the need to inconvenience my bf & ask for his ID again so that she could compare them detail by detail.  

Sorry lady, they are not the same ID because the CA drivers license was redesigned years ago, and mine is the ""older"" design.  The fact that door staff would not be trained to know that and make me feel awkward before I even step foot in the establishment definitely turned me off.  It was only until I offered to show her my passport that she deemed my real, authentic CA ID passable.

Hey, I guess I should just take it as a compliment that I look youthful, ha!",2

1. Service behind the bar is terrible.  We sat at the bar for over 20 minutes before getting asked for our drink order.  It was 4pm... It was our small group and 7 other people... Bartenders were too busy chatting in the corner.

2. Way overpriced for what you're getting.  Sure the ""quality of ingredients"" is higher than some of the cheaper Greek places downtown, but the taste is severely lacking.  Just a fancy mermaid atmosphere does not warrant these prices.

3.  I don't even understand how this is possible at a GREEK restaurant, but the hummus SUCKS.  Tasteless, chunky, where's the olive oil??? Ugh it's just upsetting and borderline offensive.

35520,3,1547337600000,"I've visited Angels' home away from home, also known as Tempe Diablo Stadium, a few times, most recently two weeks ago.  The ballpark certainly serves its purpose, but the facility is not nearly as nice as the other ballparks in the area.

We came here for a Dodgers/Angels game on a Monday afternoon.  The game was sold out, and all the parking spots were taken loooooong before the first pitch.  We showed up at 11:30 for a 1 pm game, and we were forced to park in a parking lot of a corporate building far, far away.  Walking back to the stadium, we had to, ahem, dodge cars and scalpers, which wasn't exactly an R&R type of activity.

Once inside the stadium, I felt much better.  Let's face it, there are worse places to be on a Monday afternoon.  We had seats just to the left of 3rd base, 5 rows up.  I was surprised that such good seats were not seats at all.  They were bleacher benches with back support.  There was hardly any legroom at all, and when someone needed to get through, it was an adventure in itself.  The concourses are also very small and crowded, so getting concessions or walking to the bathroom is no picnic, either.

I like how the ballpark is designed to look like a mini Angel Stadium, complete with giant red letters ""A"" and the view of the mountains to the left and the freeway in centerfield.  The ushers at Tempe Diablo Stadium are also among the most lenient and friendliest in all of Cactus League.  Well done!",2

I had a larger party for my birthday, so I had to put my credit card down for the reservation. I had a feeling the whole group wouldn't show up on time, and unfortunately, the didn't, however, everyone arrived within 20 minutes of the reservation. I was the first to arrive, and in the begining the waiter seemed attentive. It was packed, so I was excited. As the night went on, the patrons had trickled out, and I think our waiter checked out....

My last friends that showed up had to wait 30 minutes for the waiter to even come back around to order drinks. At that point, we ordered a round of drinks & some appetisers. It took about 45 minutes for the appetisers to show up, and at that point, we were STARVING, so we ate them up as we ordered our entrees. The apps were really good!

However, this is when we all start losing our patience.... because it took us 2 HOURS to get our entrees!!!!! The waiter went MIA for almost an hour.... We asked the hostess where he was and if we could do something about it, and she had mentioned ""did you talk to a manager?"".....

Isn't us complaining a hostess' cue to get the manager over? Apparently not... because the manager was MIA, too.

I was about 2 minutes away from getting up and leaving, when our entrees came... FINALLY!

Then waited another hour for our check, in which they're not able to split into separate checks... apparently.... and there's no ATMs around the area, either... apparently.... *eyeroll*

My friends had babysitters who they had to over pay because dinners don't typically last 4 hours in a restaurant that's half empty where you pay $40/plate.... on a Thursday.... with a reservation....

43650,3,1546646400000,"Actually kind of disappointed with breakfast here on Mother's Day.  Went there with the family (2 adults, 2 kids) expecting a nice breakfast together.  The coffee was quite weak, and as it was served in a glass mug, kind of looked like tea.  

Kids had chocolate pancakes.   The portion was very healthy, even overly so, but there was nothing special about the flavor.

The eggs Benedict...true disappointment.  Eggs Benny is all about the Hollandaise, and this homemade version was of the caliber that you might find in a high school culinary class.  Lacked seasoning and was over-whisked.   The dish was sloppily put together -- a far cry from the visual treat that a well put together EB should present.  I wish I had snapped a photo to show you, but I actually didn't because it just wasn't visually appealing.

Had reservations for a small group and was seated in the lounge with tables below your knees. The noise level was so loud that a conversation was impossible. The food was not bad but was not worth the price charged. We tried the Mac n cheese, raviolis, hamachi, some pasta, grill cheese and tomato soup, over cooked sliders, ahi tacos, some other stuff too, nothing memorable. Saw the tomahawk ribeye that our neighbor ordered for $125 and laughed. Was not about to order that piece of sh#t. Bill was $985, with tip $1200. The desert was mediocre, no one finished it, yet we were still hungry. Left still hungry but wasn't about to order anything more. If you're getting tapas pass this place up and go to Fire Flies (salmonella isn't that bad), better yet go to yard house, food is the same quality but will fill you up. You are paying purely for the hype. Go to Gordon Ramsey Steak, Carnivino, Le Cirque, Joël Robuchon, Strip Steak, L'Atelier, Blue Ribbon (when they where open), all are high end dinning with a price tag to match, but you will leave with an experience that was worth it. There are so many good restaurants in Vegas. I feel used after leaving this place. Rarely in my 20 years of living in Vegas have I felt this way. On a positive, our service was excellent. It did not feel like you were in a 5 star restaurant, more like a club/ lounge but our waitress was attentive. I would not blame her for our experience. If the price was 1/3 of what we were charged they would receive 4 stars but with their prices comes expectations, that were not met.

We started with three of the cheeses, we had the waitress pick, one was goad, one was sheep and one was the blue cheese, each cheese was very unique and complimented each other the bread choice was perfect.  Next we had the TarTar de Carne.  It was my first time trying Steak TarTar and I really cant imagine it getting much better than this.  Next they brought out the Octopus, it was a bit smokey and good but definitely not something that knocked my socks off, probably would not order it again.  Next they brought out the Lobster Paella, it was by far the best Paella I had in my life. So far at this point,  I'm definitely leaning towards 5 stars.  Then they brought out the Secreto Ibérico (Pork Flank), very Spanish but nothing special.  Once done, we tried the Empanada's these were very good, but missing that special magic to bring it to the next level.  For Desert we tried the Fried Milk and Chocolate Pudding.  You can tell they use quality ingredients and all the desert descriptions looked intriguing (olive oil and sea salt with pudding or dried olive oil).  Presentation as with everything was very good, but they were ultimately just ""good""  as the portions of the desert weren't very large and we barely ate half.

Our party of eight ordered the oysters Rockefeller, seared ahi tuna tartare, fried calamari, and seafood sampler appetizers.  I tried all but the last, and all were adequate-to-amazing.  The oysters Rockefeller were goeey-cheesy, spinachy and warm, with just the slightest tinge of salty oyster flavor beneath.  The ahi tuna tartare was fresh, perfectly seared and presented beautifully.  Even the standard calamari was above-average: warm and soft, not rubbery in the slightest.

My wedge salad with diced roma tomatoes, fresh-ground black pepper and creamy bleu cheese dressing was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The lobster bisque, presented with a zig-zag of cream down the middle, was a tad salty for my tastes.  But it did boast more than the usual amount of lobster chunks.  I've had better, but this was still good.

For my entree, I enjoyed the 12-ounce filet mignon with gorgonzola butter melted over it.  My date had the jumbo scallops with spicy Thai sauce.  Both were dazzling.  My steak was lean, immensely flavorful and perfectly prepared (warm and pink throughout, with no raw parts in the middle).  Our party ordered family-style sides: creamed spinach, asparagus with Hollandaise, horseradish mashed potatoes and au gratin potatoes.  I didn't try the spinach, but the rest were terrific.  And plentiful: nobody was left wanting for any of them.

For dessert, I enjoyed the bananas Foster bread pudding.  I'm normally not a bread pudding kinda guy, but it stood out on the dessert menu, so I gave it a shot.  I was not disappointed: hot, smooth, firm, with the perfect amount of banana, real whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream.  The cappucino served with dessert was lukewarm, but the service staff came around and topped it off with fresh hot coffee.

Speaking of the service staff, they could not have been more attentive to all of the various mundane tasks that often get overlooked: refilling water glasses, whisking away finished plates, scooping up crumbs with those nifty crumb-scooper-upper thingies.

My wife and I were having a great day in Vegas today.  We were suckered though into a ""deal"" to eat at TI, saving approx 15 bucks.  Good deal?  We think not.  My wife got the hummus, some of the other Greek items, shrimp and a couple of fruit tarts.  When we left we ended up having to rush into a taxi because my wife started feling ill (we had planned on walking back to our hotel).  When we arrived at the hotel, my wife had to rush back to our room and spent the next hour or so throwing up.  We are pretty sure it was the shrimp.  She was feeling GREAT before eating here, so we're positive something was wrong with the food. I called the mgr, who politely told me that he didn't think it could be food poisoning because food poisoning doesn't set in an hour after eating bad food.  He said we could file a report, but we didn't want to waste anymore time on this place.

Please be careful what you eat if you eat here.  Some of the food looked like it had been out for a while.  The salads are pretty good and the desserts are so-so.  Overall though, in hindsight, it was a really bad idea.  My wife's stomach is still hurting her pretty bad right now (6 hours later).  I'm going to try and get a refund tomorrow.  If my wife is still sick tomorrow I guess we'll file a report.  I really hope we can just forget about TI though.  They've wasted enough of our time already on this trip.

This is my first review on yelp.  Sorry to start off as such a complainer, but I really felt it was necessary to get the word out on this place.",2

The order was in at 3:12pm and we waited for 20mins for our food when there was no other customer beside us. Food presentations looked nice and colourful...definitely not messy. Bao are pretty tasty, a bit blend on the pork belly one and I wish they could warm the bao a bit more before serving. Fries are wayyyy tooooo crispy, I couldnt even poke it in with fork. Hopefully those problems can be improved as its only their first week into the business.",2

Yesterday at the back bar where the comedy should takes place, me and 2 men sat at the bar to gamble and have drinks. The bartender passed us up for service multiple times, while waiting on other customers also seated at the bar. At first, the assumption was.. he'll get to us, it is busy. Then, it was.. really?!?! After about 20 maybe 25 mins another bartender who is actually familiar with us was coming in to start his shift. He was hustling and trying to get himself situated. As soon as he did, he walked right up to us and asked, ""had anyone prepared a beverage for you all?"" My friend said, no and thank you. See the other bartender did prepare ME a drink through me forcing him to stop while he was ringing up a bar tab for some people who sat down after we did by 10 mins. I ordered a margarita which was awful and when he brought it to me he wasn't sure whether I was just ordering or playing the machine at the bar. If he had of taken the time to assist us like he did everyone else, he would of known.. but instead he just asked  ""Are you guys together?"" And I replied yes. He sat the drink down and walked away without bothering to ask the two gentleman with me if they needed anything. So, Mr. Asian bartender Alberto, you need to brush up on your cultural and ethical attitude towards minorities. Our money is just as good and hard earned as anyone else's my friend or was it just the color of my skin? And the sooner you learn that the better. It's people like you who leave me with a bad taste in my mouth yet, someone different from you likely gave you the opportunity and the job!! So, how dare you place your personal ways before in judging anyone. I hope this yelp reaches SOUTHPOINT CASINO... because you have a bad seed working there, that also reflects on your company. And the worse part is... I could of been your boss sitting there waiting for you to have some just cause, for why you treated a customer that way. Thank you to the wonderful and always pleasant and attentive bartender DAMON!!! Cudos to you for always doing your job the way it should be done. He is the kind of employee a company should proud to have working for them. Best customer service always!!! Alberto maybe have ruined the start of the evening but Damon saved the entire night.

Their shoe staff is helpful and will even look up shoes for you off the clearance rack (most store staff don't even care what you think if you're buying off the clearance rack) to see if another size/color is at another store.

33184,1,1548288000000,"Nice place, great service, but the food is bad.

Went to watch the Monday Night Football game with friends.  We sat at the bar and got great service from Jenn and Issac.  Happy hour drink prices are good, but at 7:00 we had to pay the full price, which is kind of high.  They have flat screens everywhere with the game sound on, so all was good until the food arrived.  We started with Nachos, which were very mediocre.  Just cheese poured over cold chips.  Then  I ordered sliders cooked ""medium"", and Jim ordered a cheeseburger ""medium""  The order took a long time, and we found out why.  The burgers were so overcooked and dry, we took a few bites and left them.  The fries were probably good five minutes earlier, but they arrived cold.  We spent a lot of money at Majerle's only to have to stop at In and Out Burger to get something to eat.

43479,1,1546905600000,"I LOVE this restaurant for Saturday/Sunday afternoon dim sum service.  I have never eaten here for a regular lunch or dinner - this review is specific to their dim sum service only.

Dim sum is a style of chinese cuisine served in bite-sized portions in small steamer dishes or on small plates.  Each dish usually comes with 3 - 4 pieces, ideal for sharing.  

Dim Sum is located on Central Avenue.  When you first pull in the parking lot, you may have second thoughts. The lot is full of pot holes and the building is a non-descript concrete square.  But, if you continue looking around, you'll notice the parking lot is probably full and there may be a line out the door - this place is a treasure!

On Saturday and Sunday afternoons, they serve traditional dim sum service.  Once you are seated, be prepared for your meal to begin quickly.  Servers with carts will come around and offer you what is available.  They will lift the lid of each dish to show you the food, if you don't know what it is - just ask!  

Each cart has a loose theme:  

The steamer cart - full of steamed dumplings and buns.  From this cart, I really like to get the pork siu mai (shoo my) - open-topped dumpling with ground pork and spices; pork steamed bun - bready bun filled with savory pork and sauce; and the leek and shrimp dumplings - shrimp and leek in a fully enclosed dumpling.  You may also like the sticky rice - this is a bundle of rice with pork and chicken bits cooked in and wrapped in a lotus leaf.   From here you can also get steamed chicken feet and pork spare ribs. 

The paste cart - this cart has shrimp and other meats that are wrapped in white, gelatinous noodles -- that look like paste.  I don't care for the texture of these items, so I wave this cart on.

The open-plate cart - this is my favorite!  On here you have items that are not steamed - they may be fried, pan seared or sauteed.  Hands-down favorite item is the stuffed eggplant with a fried shrimp mixture in it; I also like the leek dumpling and the taro root dumpling filled with pork and shrimp mixture.  The chinese brocolli, squid and spare ribs are also very good. 

This is a delightful way to spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon with family/friends.  Go, you won't be disappointed!",1

I like coming here to study because the tables are big and the food is alright. 
I won't say the food I've tried is the best. I had Leone's healthy meal and the omelet. The first time I was here, the omelet wasn't cooked thoroughly and as I broke open the omelet the egg in the middle was running. :(

22089,2,1546992000000,"Royaltea is a new edition to the bubble tea family at Midland and Finch.  It's taken over a unit that has omniousally changed establishments every 1-2 years.  Haunted one may call that spot.  However, seeing as there are many long-term restaurants in that plaza that have survived over the years, even with so many negative yet truthful reviews  under their belt, I guess there isn't any need to worry. What I do worry about though is the quality of food whenever a new business pops up in that spot.

Royaltea is no different from its predecessors.  Put it this way: unlike the flashy theatre-esque sign inside the trendy room, there is nothing flashy nor bright about the drinks.  The creators behind the drinks tried to make them flashy and bright, with galaxy coloured drinks in light bulb flasks being the star items. However, what you receive isn't a Spectrum Passion Fruit Tea with purple and orange streaks, but instead a swampy green-brown ''water'' with seeds floating about - aka an average passion fruit tea! Where's the pizazz? The gimmick?  At least they still used a light bulb flasks as the cup...at a regrettably high, inexhangeable price (approx. $7 for a small size).

There is nothing royal about Royaltea, except for the exhorbent prices.  The drinks taste watered down, seeds are not strained out, sizes are inaccurate, and every sip leaves a bad aftertaste in the mouth.  With so many competing bubble tea shops in the neighbourhood, I advise you to avoid this one.  Even the free HK milk teas you get in a combo set at many western Chinese fusion cafes are better by a long shot. You will save your tastebuds and wallet by shuffling over to Co Co or Latea instead.",1

South Park has been greatly improved over the years, from overall structure to the quality of stores.

I've heard from many of my friends who migrated down here from the north that South Park has many of the stores they are used to up there.

That's great...I don't really care.
What matters to me is that they have a Cheesecake Factory, there are lots of attractive women walking around, and its easy to get in, get whatever you may need, and get out!

That's a guys point of view, I know, but it is true.

We had a reservation for 12:15, made months in advance. We arrived at 12:05 and the restaurant was almost completely empty. A HUGE crowd from the convention center arrived around the same time. Some of the convention folks had reservations for 12:00 and were promptly seated - totally fine. We (toward the front of the crowd) were told to wait until closer to our reservation, which was okay, since we were a few minutes early. 

As we sat off to the side, the host staff seated multiple large parties without reservations and the restaurant quickly became very full. Around 12:13, after the crowd died down, a member of our group asked if we could be seated yet. The hostess rudely told her we needed to continue waiting until closer to our reservation time, to ensure that we enjoyed good service. Right before 12:15, the same woman walked over to seat our party, acting completely unaware that we were confused and unhappy. Our table had obviously been sitting empty the entire time we waited in the entrance. After ordering, we got to sit around and watch everyone else in the restaurant get their food before us, even though we had arrived first, with a reservation. 

Maybe I don't understand how restaurant seating works, but from a customer's point of view, it is very annoying to see multiple large parties without reservations be seated before your reservation will be accepted (and you're less than 10 minutes early). To us, it felt like the host staff was purposefully making us wait, to spite us. If that was not the case, they could have kindly explained their protocol.

To start, we shared the Queso Fundido. So indulgent! Yummy! If you like goat cheese, you will love this plate of bubbly-deliciousness. Next, I got the Chilaquilas. They were pretty spot on. The flavors were bold and deep - and all tied together well. We all loved our experience.

22506,2,1546732800000,"The park itself seems pretty okay. Nice soccer field area with hills that would be nice for an afternoon picnic. Unfortunately, like most reviews, the area is covered in cigarette butts. =\ not too appealing. I walk my dog around here and have discovered the off leash dog-park. Which I love/hate for a few reasons. 

1) The People. The few times I have come when it's ""busy"" the people aren't paying any attention to their pets. I've come by driving with my dog (she's too small to walk from home) and people let their dogs off leash in the parking lot to run to the park. Very very dangerous. So keep an eye out for someone's pup. 

2) Again, cigarette butts. There should be a designated spot for smoking. Not the entire dog park. There's butts everywhere. I don't want my dog eating your gross trash. 

3) Size. I don't mind the area size, again, my dog is small so it's more than enough room for her to run. But I wish they had a smaller dog section. While the signs say ""35lb and under"" and ""over 35lb"" people don't really adhere to it. Mostly smaller dogs come to the park, so when people let their huge dogs play with the little ones, it's unnerving. Even still, 35 lbs is a lot of dog beside a 5lb dog.",3

There were about 4 workers inside though and they were very quick and attentive to the customers in line. I got the salty caramel truffle in a pretzel cone (loooove pretzel cones!) and my husband got something chocolatey in a waffle cone (even though he asked for a pretzel cone and they messed up, he just didn't say anything).

What my girlfriend and I experienced was fantastic food, wonderful service and just as I remembered it, a great atmosphere.

I had a tasty margarita, just the classic.  We ordered the guacamole to compliment our chips and salsa; which by the way comes with two salsas, one that is chunky and sweet with a small hint of heat, the other seemed to be tomatillo based and was equally good.  The guacamole was just as I remembered, chunky and delicious.  My girlfriend tried the Enchiladas de pollo.  She loved the flavor of the smoked chicken.  I had Puerco en Chipotle, which is slow roasted pork in a tomatillo-chipotle sauce.  It was darn good.  I didn't eat to much of my sides because I had consumed so much guacamole and the pork was just too good!

We were there on a Saturday night about 1900 and were seated immediately on the patio.  Our server was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.

Overall fantastic, just as I remembered.  Sure you may have to park on the street (we did); no worries, it's a great place.

The clams tasted fresh and the pasta was garlicky and buttery. I also had the Caesar salad which had real bacon and the dressing was creamy. 

For dessert, my friends tried the tiramisu which looked kind of sloppy but was apparently very tasty.     One of my friends had wanted coffee but their machine was broken. The teas they offered were regular fare such as orange pekoe, earl grey, green tea and chamomile (the four o'clock brand).

Like others here, the prices aren't an issue - as Chris N said, if I want cheap, I'll go to Target. Bella's prices aren't out of line with city department stores or boutiques. 

What stops me from loving this place and shopping here frequently are two things: 1. the location. It's in the middle of a strip in an ugly area of town with nothing around it. So it's a destination - there's no walking there, or walking around to anything else once I'm there. I am not a ""lady who lunches"", and my so my time is at a premium. Going there is an effort on my part. If I'm not assured that I'll love the clothing, or I just simply don't have the time to browse through every item,  then what ends up happening is that I go downtown to Circles. If Circles doesn't have anything, at least I can head to Aroma, or Jane Addams.  Or, conversely, if I don't have much time, but I'm downtown, I can ""pop"" into Circles for 15 minutes and check out what's new. I used to be able to do some of that when they were at the shoppes of Knollwood, but I can't do either with their new location.

2. I've also noticed, tho I won't swear to it, that because they are a destination shop, the people who go in there all seem to know each other and the sales staff. It's a little ""clubby"" feeling. I always feel like an interloper because everyone seems to know everyone else.

I also really enjoyed Ciao, the restaurant sharing the same owners as Cibo that previously operated in the same space. This particular evening, I dined with 3 girlfriends.

I ordered the gnocchi, which I have previously had at both other locations. The tomato sauce had absolutely no taste. Another one of my friends also ordered a dish with the tomato sauce and agreed. We immediately notified the waitress. She offered to bring us chili oil. Never did she offer to let us order a new dish or to remake our meals. Instead she said ""I've been hearing complaints from other tables too."" The waitress also told my friend that her food might not taste good because of alterations (she had not even made any to the menu-item but not professional to argue with the customer). She also never offered to let us speak to a manager. Her attempted resolution was highly unprofessional and inadequate (especially if other tables had voiced a similar concern).

At the end of the meal, we asked to speak to the manager (we were hopeful that the waitress would have been told the manager to visit our table after 2/4 of us complained but clearly this was wishful thinking). We shared our experience with her and she said she would ""take care of it"". We assumed we all got a free meal as is generally the outcome when more than one person is unhappy with their meal. She didn't charge my friend and I for our meals. I thought it was so tacky that they charged the other two guests. Even though they were satisfied with their meals, our dissatisfaction and complaining impacted their dining experience. The manager was hardly apologetic. Before we were able to get 2/4 meals comped, she offered us dessert ... not really enough considering how awful the food was.

They better get their act together if other customers expressed a similar concern. Too bad for them ... I live a block away and wanted to like it.",3

33070,2,1548288000000,"You hear a lot of talk about ""world class"" stuff in Toronto, and sometimes that's just covering up for a feeling of inadequacy. But that's not the case with the TSO. They're outstanding, and every year play with much of the top talent in the international music scene.

For the last few years, the TSO has been helmed by local-boy-by-way-of-England Peter Oundjian, who's helped revitalize the ensemble. You can tell how genuinely enthusiastic he is when he's conducting, and I wouldn't be that surprised if that enthusiasm has boosted the TSO.

The TSO is also making admirable efforts to keep classical music alive for ""youngsters"" like me; they have a ""tsoundcheck"" program that allows access to cheap seats for the under-thirty crowd.

32967,3,1547251200000,"Walked in and tripped not once but twice on the uneven entrance. Oof! Bartender greeted us and sat us on the patio, with menus and went back to the bar to polish glasses or whatever they do when they aren't asking if they can get you a drink... we sat and took in the atmosphere, the ambiance, the décor, the view and about thirty other things while we waited and waited and waited for someone, anyone to drop by and say Hey! Six of those thirty other things were staff who never got close enough to call over without having to raise our voices or doing the annoying restaurant wave. So we waited some more. We turned it into a little game of How Long Do *you* Think.

Usually when you get a menu you can sort out what is on the cards and decide on your meal for the evening, drinks, whatever. Oh sure, you may have questions about some things, but in general the menu gives you the story. Not at Old School. I like barbecue and that was what I wanted. Brisket and some sides, maybe a couple of sauces. Nothing that you wont get at any place that BRAGS about their pit, which Old School does. So where on the menu can I find me some brisket? In a mess and maze of wordy condition, we finally find it under SIDES. WTF? BBQ is a side? 

Oh, and we were still waiting for someone to take a drink order. I figure I can ask about the brisket when that happens. Our wait person returns at a casual pace and we order two malted milkshakes, chocolate for me and strawberry for K. Off he goes. After another good opportunity to count the bricks in the wall, a different waiter approaches and deftly places a chocolate shake in front of me. He does the same for K, which is just wrong as she did not want chocolate. So K says that she ordered strawberry, and the waiter explains that our original waiter probably just double ordered the chocolate shakes by pressing the key twice on the screen, but that he will get it sorted out. It happens often enough that they know why it happens? Why not sort it out instead?

Our waiter appears and comes over with K`s shake and almost as an afterthought asks if we want food. I ask about getting brisket, and he explains that it is a side, I ask about getting it as a meal and he tells us he has to go check with the kitchen. Off he goes, and we wait some more. He returns and tells me I can order brisket and two sides for $15, which I do. K orders fried chicken. And then waiter is back to tell me that actually, I cannot have brisket and two sides for $15, the brisket is $15 and if I want sides they are extra. Okay, I have no problem with that except 1. The price for the brisket is nowhere on the menu and 2. I was told that Brisket and two sides would be $15. I ask how much, you tell me how much, I order. Make food, bring food, done deal. Not at Old School. Annoyed, I order a burger with fries.

We wait some more. The table behind us arrived, ordered and ate in the time it took to get our food. We would have asked about it but the staff were unable to make it all the way to our section of the patio. Not because it was crowded, or busy, or out of the way. They just seemed more interested in hanging out as far away from the customers as possible. Food arrives, and it is good. The burger is quite tasty, good texture to the beef and just slightly overcooked. The fries, however, tell a different tale. Did you ever go skiing in the 70's and get fries that came with that weird red spice shit that tasted exactly like weird red spice shit? Now I get what Old School means...

K's chicken is over-breaded and the paper placed on the tray disintegrates and becomes part of her meal. The coleslaw is good, though, and you do not have to ingest any part of the serving dishes along with it. She did get her shake, and they were good, although overly sweet and over priced by about $3.

This is getting long, but that is how our evening felt. Long. Drawn out. Tedious. We had to get up and go find someone to give us a bill, as our waiter had told us as he dropped our food that he had been there since 10AM (it was now 7PM) and was so tired he had to get home... so imagine our surprise when he was hanging out with the six staff by the cash, well concealed in the ''store'' section of the restaurant. None of whom seemed interested in helping us, so we asked the guy standing and looking at the cash register in what looked like horror and disinterest if we could please pay. He asked us for our bill, and K said, Well, no, no-one brought it which is why we were here, asking him for it. He gives us the wrong bill (he had three to choose from) and when we get the correct one it has a charge for brisket on it. He gets annoyed at having to take it off and I tell K I am going to be outside. Where I will remain for the rest of my days, as I will never set foot in Old School again.*

I was married here on 12/12/09 and of course we only had so much money to work with. I came across this place and it seem OK for the price. The package we got was $3,500 and when asked if we can reduce the price because we weren't using their flowers (bringing our own) and was hiring a second photographer (our package only included the photographer for the ceremony) they wouldn't. Saying ""It's a package"" 

Cake: As for my cake the 3 options that came with the package were kind of ugly I paid the extra $200 for a better cake. Pretty piping, flowers cascading down the side...I told them I wanted no flowers on the cake and that I would be bring in my topper. I brought in my topper as requested the day before and the day of my wedding when I arrived early to check everything out I go to the kitchen to look at my cake and it was HORRIBLE. It looked nothing like the photo they advertise, the black piping was running and it was all shaky. They didn't even put my topper on the cake, they said ""It was too heavy"" but if they had a Real Baker there they would know they need to put cardboard under the frosting to hold it. So they just left the top empty (instead of calling and asking/stating what my alternative would be) and placed the Topper next to the cake at the bottom on the table. We had them put flowers on the top to hide the empty. 

The staff: At times seem as if they didn't know what they were talking about! My package only included the photographer for the ceremony and some shots after. I hired a second photographer for the Getting ready part and reception. I asked them if there would be any problems w/ my photographer being there before the wedding started and they said ""No that is fine"". My second shooter even called and ask the Chapel as well they told her the same thing. The day of my wedding they are telling us she cant be here until the reception and when I corrected them; they told us ""Just have her out of here (bride's room) before their photographer gets there or he'll be mad.""  When I stressed my concerns with the cake it was as if they didn't even care (THEY HAD THEIR MONEY ALREADY ATTITUDE) the people were kind of snotty and it felt as if I was being rushed through everything. The DJ for the reception was a told Creep as well!!

Freshly made by the minute. The sesame bagel with regular cream cheese was plain and simple yet it served its purpose as bagel. The bagel was lighter, it had a crusty crunch to it and yield a great sesame flavor. The best part (at least to me) was their cream cheese. If you ever had New York's cream cheese, they're a lot more dense and heavy so once you taste Fairmount's cream cheese you can definitely tell the difference. Fairmount's cream cheese is so much lighter, felt like it was whipped which is not bad. By whipping, you're adding more air into the cream cheese, hence the texture will be a lot lighter.

Washington and stare at the city while we eat/drink for our special occasion.  Monday, my wife called and made reservations for Thursday at 7:30pm and requested a table by the windows.  She was told that it wasn't a problem but there might be a 5-10 minute wait for a window table even with a reservation.  That' was no problem.

Being the punctual person that I am, I was walking through the door at 7:30pm.  Told the hostess that we were there for our reservations.  This is where it gets bad.   We were told that the people who had reservations at 6:30pm still haven't arrived and that we no longer have the option for a window table.  She told us they were a whopping HOUR late for their reservation.  She explained that the group was from Philly and got lost and stuck in traffic.  Who in the hell continues to hold a reservation when the group is over an HOUR late?  My wife was pretty disappointed considering we made reservations four days prior.

As for the food, it was pretty mediocre.  Lets just say you're not going for the food.  You're going for the view.  I got the homemade crab cake dinner with a Caesar salad and steak fries.  My wife got the salmon dinner with a side salad and french fries.  My wife said the salmon was pretty decent.  They had to send my plate back because someone plated the wrong sides with my crab cakes.  For being about $30 a plate, I expected the food to be a lot better.

As stated before and by a lot of other people.  Don't set your expectations high on anything other than the view.  That's what you're going there for.  I want to send a shout out to the group from Philly who arrived an hour late for their reservation and messing up mine.",2
24964,3,1547251200000,"Der Beer Park befindet sich direkt am Paris Hotel & Casino - über dem Hexx. Man nimmt entweder außen die Treppe nach oben oder innen den Aufzug.

Wir waren am frühen Mittag (direkt zur Öffnung) dort. Die Bedienung (und auch das Personal am Empfang) hatte es wohl gar nicht eilig - wir mussten nämlich ziemlich warten. Es lief zwar viel Personal herum, z.B. um die Tische mit Soßenträgern einzudecken, aber wir wurden zunächst ignoriert - obwohl noch gar keine anderen Gäste da waren.
Wir bekamen dann einen Tisch zugewiesen und nach einer Weile kam dann tatsächlich auch eine Bedienung an unseren Tisch. Von da an gab es ""personaltechnisch"" nichts mehr zu meckern, denn unsere Bedienung war sehr nett und aufmerksam. Wir hatten einen Burger, einen Caesars Salat und ein Spezial-Angebot mit Brisket.
Anfangs saßen wir noch im Schatten, später wanderte dieser, so dass wir halb in der Sonne saßen. Tipp: Bei heißen Sonnenwetter möglichst nah am Gebäude und nicht zur Straße hin sitzen. 
Zur Kühlung wurde dann die Wasserdampfanlage angemacht - ich persönlich hasse diese Dinger, die es leider inzwischen an fast jeder Ecke am Strip gibt - aber das ist wohl Geschmackssache. Zum Glück haben wir davon an unserem Tisch nur wenig abbekommen. 

Wie man sich schon beim Namen denken kann - ist die Hauptspezialität vom Beer Park Bier. Auch wenn der ganze Laden mit Budweiser gebrandet ist, bekommt hier Biersorten aus aller Welt (auch aus Deutschland). 
Tipp: An der Theke kann man kostenlos einzelne Biersorten probieren - einfach nachfragen. Wir haben so jedenfalls eine neue leckere Biersorte gefunden (zufälligerweise sogar aus Las Vegas).

Das Essen kam im normalen Zeitrahmen. Wichtig ist: Wie schon erwähnt, sind Biere die Hauptspezialität - den Speisen kommt hier nur eine Nebenrolle zu.  Sie werden so serviert, dass man sie am Tisch mit allen teilen kann und es gibt wohl nur Plastikgeschirr.
Der Burger war saftig und mittelmäßig lecker - völlig okay, aber nichts besonderes. Für den Preis auf jeden Fall zu teuer.
Der Caesars Salat war lecker, allerdings mit zu wenig Dressing - ebenfalls zu teuer für den Preis.
Das Brisket-Spezial war lecker und wirklich reichlich - der Preis war angemessen.
Das Bier - sehr lecker - unverschämt teuer - ein Glas für 11$.

Der Ausblick auf den Strip geht auf die gegenüberliegenen Hotels. Die Fontänen vom Bellagio kann man nur sehen, wenn man sich ganz aussen an die Geländertische setzt - dann sitzt man tagsüber allerdings in der prallen Sonne.
Man kann hier viele Spiele spielen, die überall verteilt sind (z.B. Tischkicker, Jenga usw.). Außerdem - wie üblich in den meisten Bars/Restaurants - gibt es einige Fernseher - meist mit Sportsendungen. 

Wir hatten hier einen Groupon-Gutschein (16$ bezahlt für 40$-Wert an Speisen & Getränken). Es gab keine Probleme bei der Einlösung.
Nun zur Rechnung ... Es gibt in Las Vegas eine Handvoll Läden, die nehmen unverschämterweise eine ""Concession Fee"" in Höhe von 4,7%. Es wird zwar auf der Karte darauf hingewiesen - aber ziemlich klein in einer Ecke. Okay, wir wussten das vorher und hatten ja außerdem eine gute Ersparnis durch den Groupon-Gutschein. Trotzdem empfinden wir diese ""Concession Fee"" als unverschämt, vor allem, da die Preise hier eh schon gesalzen sind.

Fazit: Wir würden hier nicht mehr hingehen. Wir fanden das Essen als zu teuer - und nur zum Biertrinken ist es erst recht viel zu teuer.",2

The building is very chic and the place looked exactly like a place I wanted to visit later. So today my fiancé and I went in for lunch.  Let it first be mentioned that we checked the star rating here on Yelp...4 star...too bad we didn't read the reviews because this place was not worth the effort.  The design of the restaurant is great.  I guess I should start by saying this is not a real restaurant...this is more like a lounge with an extended menu.  Ordered the hummus, sliders, satay and pad Thai.  Hummus was not good...much better out of a jar at any supermarket.  Sliders were okay a little greasy looking.  Satay was cold...not on purpose...just not properly cooked or served.  The pad Thai was a disaster...normally we are intelligent enough to avoid ordering something like this in a mock fusion restaurant but the menu was so limited we didn't really have a choice...the noodles were so overlooked they were mushed and the dish was over spiced probably to overcompensate for the poor quality. We ordered the bread pudding to go...for the record...I love bread pudding...any bread pudding pretty much...this stuff was terrible...I literally spit it into my kitchen sink.  Beyond disappointed.

I've been here a couple times, but never wrote a review.  It was always for an event, so I didn't know if my experience was a genuine experience.  It is the epicenter, so expect a diverse crowd.  A general mix of what Charlotte and the surrounding area is, eclectic to say the least.

On to the food.  I was surprised, like REALLY surprised.  I expected normal bar food.  I think it might just be a current special, but they have these little potato cake things, kind of a latke meets hashbrowns maybe?  Obviously fresh made and then they cover them with a gravy and scallions.  Friggin delcious!  Thanks to a heads up from Nikki W.(not the CM one) I ordered up some buffalo dip with chicken that was a great way to get some wing flavor without all the mess.  I had a cute date and was trying to show some manners.

What really gave it the 5th star was the service though.  Although quite young, our server seemed to have an attentive smiling face seemingly no matter what else was going on.  Plus, the manager on duty, a dark haired, smiling, young lady even came over to ask how everything was.  Not something you normally see in a bar situation.

As far as the decor goes, there is a mechanical bull, what else could you ask for.  Lava lamps all over one of the bars?  Cowhide on the back of the barstools?  Does it all work?  Thats up to you I guess, but it gave me plenty to look at.

I don't know that this will be my first choice in bars in Charlotte, but it will always be there as an option, especially when entertaining out of towners.  There's a non-chain feel to the place that is hard to come by these days.",1

I had the vegetable platter from the appetizer menu (my staple first order when I try a new Mediterranean place) and he had the gyro plate. Fresh pita was warm and soft, out of this world best falafel I've ever tasted. My husband raved about the lamb. He literally said ""now I know why you say you could eat Mediterranean food every day."" Everything was delicious. Our server was friendly and everyone there made an effort to make us feel welcome. The prices are extremely reasonable and they offer an array of wines, beers, and shots as well. Will definitely come back!!!! Thank you!!",2

I look forward to receiving their daily lunch special email as it frequently lures me in. I have several favorites on the menu but really enjoy trying their creation of the day. They always have three unique items to choose from. The go to items in my book would be the salmon blt, chef salad or the French dip sandwich. None of these are your run off the mill variety. The portions are above average with top notch quality and fair prices. Fun and comfortable place to spend your lunch hour.",3

24094,1,1546819200000,"What a total disappointment.

We arrived at 6 pm. There are about 10 tables in the restaurant and we were among the first few since they had opened only at 5:30 pm. This is what we ordered:

Bay Scallop Tempura Skewers
Beef Short Ribs (both are ""tapas)
Gyoza Skewers
Ikura Nigiri
Bistro Cold Udon
Two bowls of rice
Lamb Chop
Hamachi Kama

It wasn't a huge order and mostly small plates. Here's the problem--after 90 minutes, yes one and half hours, we still hadn't received our order of lamb chop or hamachi kama! And the server was sadly unable to care, stating, ""Well, our menu does say it can take 45 minute to an hour to receive your order."" Ok, maybe--but again, it was 90 minutes and the other food came out so sporadically as if we were having a seven-course meal. [first the short ribs, then 10 minutes later, the ikura. Then 10 minutes later, the scallops and gyoza skewers and then the udon. Then we just WAITED and WAITED for the other dishes that never came.] Our server claimed the chef makes everything in the order that it's received. Huh? That doesn't make any sense. Again, maybe that's what he/she does--but (1) that's how fast-food restaurants cook, not ""bistros"" and (2) if that was the case, we should've have received our food much faster than the table next to us that arrived later, ordered more food (and drank an entire bottle of wine between the two of them) and left before we ever received the lamb chop or hamachi kama.

Sadly, we saw the chef/owner Yasu Hashino hanging around in plain clothes (guess he wasn't cooking tonight) at the sushi bar chatting it up with his regulars. Not one glance over at us, even when it was apparent we were unhappy and had told the hostess and server to just cancel the lamb chop and hamachi kama. 

Taste-wise, I'd say the food was decent but I've had much better in San Francisco and Honolulu. This place is just over-priced and over-hyped. The dashi with the cold udon was flavorless and the short ribs were too chewy. I would love to tell you how the hamachi kama was (one of my favorite Japanese dishes) but unfortunately we never go to try it. Also, the green tea is $2.50 per cup and NOT refillable. I guess in order to be a ""bistro"" you have to have fancy matcha and not even offer a refill of hot water. The server said it was an expensive tea and thus no refills. I asked if she had any ""less expensive"" green tea but alas no more tea for us. 

I'm unsure why this place has four stars. I can say that the terrible service and lack of concern for our failed dinner led to the final one star rating. I was really looking forward to a delicious Japanese dinner with my father and daughter. I suppose it might have earned 2 1/2 to 3 stars if we hadn't been treated so poorly. Our busser was quite attentive--I'd definitely give him a star. 

I do not live in town (not currently, but I did grow up here and lived for 30 years prior), so maybe since there are few quality Japanese restaurants in Phoenix, this one passes with 4 stars. Overall, I would say don't waste your money here--find a good Mexican seafood restaurant instead.",2

37315,2,1547856000000,"Me and my husband stopped by for a few hours on Friday night and had a total blast. We arrived at about 4:30 pm, and most tables were empty. There is no cover charge or fee - you only have to purchase something and then can sit there for as long as you want. There's no time limit for the table. We purchased a latte, a fruity tea (free water refills) and the Japanese popcorn. The prices on the coffees were quite reasonable, but I thought $3 for tea was pretty steep (haha). I didn't mind at all though, since there is no cover charge - they have to make money somehow!

We sat down at a booth with a TV. We first played a few board games, but then got the Wii hooked up and played Mario Kart (soooo fun). They have a great selection of board games, video game consoles and video games. The staff come to the table and set up the gaming console for you. We also played Mario Party, and had so much fun. I thought the price was REALLY reasonable for the amount of time we spent there and the amount of fun we had. We will definitely be back. 

A few things to note. One thing I really like about Snakes + Lattes that Riddle Room lacks, is someone coming around to explain the games to you or recommend a game. This isn't the end of the world, considering the difference in price, but just something to note. I also wish there was better selection of snacks. They have paninis, chips and popcorn and that's it. It would be nice if there were more easy food options. It was also quite cold by the end of our playing time since the front door was open. For the price though, these things aren't deal breakers for us.",2

The east 4th area itself is very cute and reminds me of being in a larger city. Greenhouse tavern, on the other hand, offers an appealing menu, but it's just too hard to enjoy. The food was way too salty. I saw it commented by other reviewers before I went, but I didn't realize how true it really was. I had the lamb burger and my friend had a steak. We shared poutine. Both of us felt like there wasn't enough water in the world to rehydrate us. If I could, I would bump this place up to 3.5 stars because the second time I went was quite enjoyable. We didn't order any food, just sat upstairs for drinks. The cocktails are inventive and fun. Reasonably priced as well.",1

27172,2,1547596800000,"I've waited a week to leave this review because I wanted some time to cool down from the experience. 
The ""Good"":
The only redeeming thing about my experience was the cucumber cocktail. I don't remember what it is called, but I would highly recommend it. It was somewhere between $12-14.
The ""Bad"":
Service - Terrible. The hostess was sitting there talking to someone on speakerphone and sucking down a to-go drink and munching on food with her fingers out of a to-go box. Once we got our food (I'll go into food later), the server disappeared. We sat there finished with our meal for 20min. My boyfriend had to get up and go and find him. He was just sitting there chatting with the kitchen staff. Also, the hostess TOTALLY saw us looking around for our server. She looked at us, looked the other direction, sucked down some of her drink and looked at us again, then looked back down at her phone. She did nothing. I seriously can't get over her attitude and disgusting sucking of that straw! We were also going to order another drink. But since it took so long to get service, we didn't want to stay there any longer. 
Food -  I heard good things about the food. We were not impressed. It was actually pretty bad. Our server suggested the sliders, so we ordered those. They were so so very dry. The buns were stale and it was just gross. We also ordered the nachos with beer cheese. I didn't like it at all. But my boyfriend thought it was alright, and definitely better than the sliders. Definitely not worth the money.
Beer - They don't have many selections of their own brews. The brew my boyfriend got was not impressive. 
OVERALL: I would only suggest going here for cocktails.",3
23340,2,1548633600000,"This review is tough for me, since I've been to Jamaica and LOVE reggae music. Went for a show on a Saturday night. Tickets were 15 bucks, which would seem cheap, however the sound system was so poor that there was constant feedback hurting people's ears. Hard to enjoy what you paid for. Also, DJ was really annoying. Playing annoying sounds and talking during bands playing. I hate that. 

The service....was something I had never seen before in my life. There was a bartender trying to work hard. It was somewhat busy and she was trying her best. There was another ""bartender"" sitting down. We didn't know what her roll was. She did occasionally stand up and open a beer for someone, but then would ask the 1 bartender that knew what to do questions, and slowing her down. I actually saw the head bartender trying to make her own drinks while pouring alcohol in the other ladies cup since she didn't know what to do. The head bartender was also running food. Even though there were only like 10 tables and a few waitresses. Just really unorthodox. Red Strips were 5 bucks. Over priced since most reggae shows sell those for 2 or 3 bucks. Over priced for such terrible service. 

I sooooo wanted to try the food!! I've heard it's great! From what little food I did see come out of the kitchen, it looked good! I asked waitress if they were still serving food and she basically said the wait was so long, it wouldn't be worth it. That is also a first for me. 
They have this beautiful patio area with a big bar that wasn't even being used. Would have alleviated the craziness inside.

Anyhow, today I am trying the french toast (see picture).  They serve you home-made bread, 2 large slices and it is not overly sweet.  They also belong to the Belly Bites reward program -- nice touch.

42344,1,1548547200000,"Very disappointed with my first (and only) visit to Local. Many things wrong:
*Server was friendly but her server skills were not good (very slow to return/did not clear plates/did not have skills to solve an issue)
*ordered appetizers; one came with our dinner; one came after dinner.When we pointed out that we did not receive it, server's comment was ""Oh! I see that"". When she returned to the table she said that the appetizer would be right up (again....after our dinner was done)
*3 of the 4 meals were cold (pizzas) Serve was not trained to solve the problem (""do you want the manager?"" was her solution) Manager was irritated that we were complaining. He went upstairs (did not take our food with him) and came back to tell us they were making new ones for us & that he would take 20% off of the cold food only?? Then he preceded to ask if we wanted our pizza heated up (didn't you just say they were making new ones?) For fear that it would take a long time again(initial order took a very long time to arrive in a restaurant that was not very busy)we said it would be ok to throw them back in the oven...which is really not legal for a restaurant to ask to do in the state of PA .They took almost as long to heat them up as they did to make them initially.
*While we were finishing dinner, a cook came downstairs and gave our table dirty looks the entire time he crossed the dining room (to the bar) and then all the way back to the steps. Another person brought food down to another table and gave a glaring look as well.
Overall very disappointing way to spend my birthday dinner out with family.",2

21323,2,1547424000000,"This review is for a recent sit-down meal (my first time at Five50).  Next time, I will try the pizza to go (which did look absolutely delicious.)
My best friend and I wanted to grab a small bite and beer at Aria.  We decided upon Five50.  For starters, it took a solid 10 minutes just to seat us.  I figured the place was packed, but once we entered the dining area, over half the tables were empty.  Not gonna lie, I was slightly hungover from Saturday night escapades, and was particularly thirsty.  It took a SOLID 15 minutes (yes, I looked at my clock) for any server to even acknowledge us! Once we were finally acknowledged, it took another 5 minutes to bring over a carafe of water.
I understand that there seemed to only be 3 servers...but again, the place was not that crowded.  The servers weren't in much of a rush either. 
The food itself was very, very good, as was its presentation.  I got the mac & cheese and my friend got the wings.  If I were rating Five50 solely based on food, I'd give it 4 stars.  The service definitely merits no more than 2 stars though.  While our waitress was friendly, the lack of attention and length of time it took to get our water, food, or really to ask for anything additional that we needed was just way beyond what it should have been.  I'm patient when I need to be (place is packed, servers running around)...but this didn't merit much patience (not crowded, servers chatting it up instead of checking on their guests).
As mentioned previously, I'll definitely give it another chance and try the pizza.  If I ever come back here for a sit-down meal though, I'll bring a bottle of water and anticipate delayed service.",2

Woooooow, that Mac and cheese! I like that it is in a resort hotel, so no rigid dress code, and they have entrees on the menu for 20$, so very affordable for a high end place. They cook everything out in the open and the chefs are truly amazing to be able to watch the multitasking and brilliant things they serve up. Also, their farm to fresh idea is really great.

39323,1,1548288000000,"I'll try and make this review short. First things first lets talk about what was great. I enjoyed the location, the hotel was in the middle of the strip, everything was in walking distance. If you plan to go to vegas, driving at night is a bad idea. The pool was very nice, but they had a charge fee for the weekends I believe, either that or it was because of a DJ party thing that happened on saturday while I was there. They gave me a discount since I am staying in the hotel, it was like $11. The pool, ALL of the poll was worth the $11 dollars. I believe there is a tiny section of the pool that is available for hotel guest without an extra charge. But all of the pool is necessary if you play on using it.

Now what I did not like was their check-in procedure. It seemed so out of order and disorganized. I have never been to vegas and experience a long line like that. They do have a machine ""express check-in/check-out"" I was tempted to use it, but I like to talk to a human and have my questions answered and be aware of any promotions going on that a machine can't tell me. When we eventually go to the front desk and checked in, he warned us about an additional fee for the pool, he advised us about the going green promotion they had. Basically we don't get any maid service for our whole stay, but we get $20 credit for specific areas in the hotel, such as food, gift shop, etc. We took it thinking we would be fine.

When we got the room 8-100, our main light switch wasn't working. It was broken and I did not want to  go back down and wait in that long line. For our 3 nights we had only 1 roll of toilet paper, we had no microwave, no coffee maker, no mini fridge, which seemed shocking for how much we paid. To charge my phone next to me, you would think there would be a night stand to lay my phone on, nope, there was none, my phone was charging on the floor. The bathroom door looked old, it was chipped a lot on the bottom. It seemed small, not much breathing room.
Also heads up wifi is free for ONLY 2 devices, after that you have to pay the extra.

When we checked out, we used the express check-out because that line was ridiculous. Our parking was going to be $30 bucks, but when you enter the machine gives you a card, you have to hold onto the parking card the whole trip. When you leave, insert the parking card, and it will charge you. BUT if you had booked a room at the hotel, you use your room key to void the fee. We tried 3 machines, we tried the 2 room keys. We called for assistance. They ended up CHARGING us for the parking when it SHOULD have been F R E E with the room.

NO

So, I wrongly assumed that they would be competent in their ability to clean clothing properly. The staff was very very friendly and did help me with their forms. I showed her a stain that needed to come out of a shirt and the attendant enthusiastically said it wouldn't be a problem to get the stain out. I also ask for flat press and no creases in  my pants, for medium starch, for  my wife's dress to be pressed, and my coat cleaned and pressed. They advertised they would text when the clothes were ready. 

I never got a text. The brand new pants had a crease down the middle and had a stain. The shirt I pointed out that needed a stain removed still had a stain. The shirts could stand on their own from the amount of starch. And my wife's dress was wrinkled from being crammed into the same bag as all of my clothes. So out of my 5 items they serviced only one item was satisfactory. This is wholly unacceptable.

33311,2,1547596800000,"Our favorite frozen yogurt place.

I love that:
1) It is yummy
2) It is self serve - you get what you want and you pay by the ounce
3) There are lots of awesome toppings
4) It is clean
5) The people are friendly
6) Reasonably priced
7) Frequent purchase cards rack up a discount really quick
8) It is yummy

I do not love that they use high fructose corn syrup.  When I inquired about this they said they only use enough to hold the yogurt - so it is not drippy.  I don't know HOW much that is...I am hoping it is not much.   I wish it was zero.

But I like Yogurtology so much for the other reasons that I still go regularly - in spite of the hfcs.

It is the one dessert option that our whole family really loves and gets excited about.",2

27555,2,1548720000000,"Let me first say that I spent hours looking for chimichangas in Phoenix at 730pm on a Friday.  Locating the lost City of Dorado may be an easier task, so I jumped for joy when I came across the menu for Los Taquitos.  They service chimis with various fillings, enchilada style upon request.  

The restaurant is easy to find from the freeway, and there is plenty of parking.  The walls are full of colorful murals, and the menu is extensive.  The cleanliness was questionable, but it didn't turn off our party from the chimichanga goodness that awaited us.  Orders are taken at the register, and the women we spoke to was helpful and pleasant.

I ordered the shrimp cocktail, my boyfriend ordered the chimi with sauce, guac, and sour cream. We shared the chips and salsa.  The red salsa is full of smokey chipotle deliciousness, but we were unable to secure a bottle of the green salsa.  The pico de gallo was bland, a solid 2/5.  My boyfriend enjoyed his carne asada chimi, but I thought the meat was burnt and could have used more oomph.  My shrimp cocktail was weird.  The shrimp were hot, the sauce was cold, it was a mess.  I don't recommend it. Overall I'd say it is asi-asi.",1

I heard while I was there that they normally pack 1500 people in there on a weekend (not sure how it would fit that many since it seems slightly small) so perhaps the bartenders were unhappy that they weren't going to be getting the amount of tips they are used to.

Definitely definitely try the (homemade) cookies-n-cream-esque gelato and the creamy (homemade) limoncello - both were tremendous!

A few months ago I was referred here by another animal hospital that I had called to see if they would take in an injured, wild bird that I found at the dog park. The bird got attacked by a big hunting dog and had lost a lot of feathers so it could no longer fly. It broke my heart to see the bird WALKING around the fenced in dog area so I picked it up and brought it home with me. I did a search for veterinarians that take in wild animals. The first place I called said that they don't do it and gave me the name of this place. I called and was able to bring in the bird right away. After the veterinarian (I didn't catch her name) performed a free exam, she said the bird didn't have any injuries, just loss of feathers, and would be okay to release back into the wild. I really appreciate a vet that actually cares about animals and not just about money. I've always taken my dog to a different vet a few miles up the road but plan on switching to this one when my dog needs her next exam or treatment.",2

So yes, there's just a sidedoor south of St Catherine that leads to a basement, and then there's black stairs down to a dark room with red couches and it's a tad worrisome at first. The chairs and tables remind me of a bar/cafe place I used to hang out at when I was around high school age (but legal, obvi) and I thought maaaan, I would hang out here all the time if I was a kid these days, and as a kid at heart I'll be back for sure. 

The fries were skinny and salty, the staff was totally nice and bilingual without even a hint of the snark I sometimes associate (to my error, clearly) with high level nerdom. There were 2 interesting beers on tap and lots of funny fruity cocktails with geek-referential names. The games are free so we could play some racing game (and by ""racing"" I do mean spinning endlessly in circles and driving into walls) and Mortal Kombat (which a friend had when I was a kid and brings out a not-entirely-attractive murderous glee in me) and then hang out with a bigger group and play Cards Against Humantity.

The place is authentic and has a good story behind it. Leave yourself enough time to walk the grounds and the adjoining community garden.

And it's expensive (which means you pay too much for it, not that it's high value). I think I had a bacon cheeseburger, fries and a serve-yourself-at-our-outside-in-the-heat-fountain drink, it it set me back like $14.",2

47103,3,1547769600000,"I stayed here for two nights the first week of April 2012.  Woot. Arizona weather really is the best. 

Overall, it was a nice place to stay. Purdy too. I bought a deal on Hotwire and wasn't sure what hotel I was booking until I paid, and it turned out to be this resort.  Overall, very satisfied for the price I paid.  However, I do not think I would pay $200+ a night here.  At that point, I would say it's not worth it.

The entrance is gorgeous and nicely updated. Trendy, modern, yet warm. Love the lit deer heads.  I want them.  It feels like a high class resort when you first go through the entrance.  Once you head to the rooms though, it does seem like an older resort.  However, our room was nicely decorated and very clean so no complaints in that area.

If you are missing your pets from home, be sure to ask for a pet fish during your stay! I asked for one, well, I had to ask twice because they forgot the first time... But soon I had a goldfish in my room which I named Basil.  (Due to me becoming inebriated on one too many cucumber basil martini's... Don't judge)

As for the room/parking, it's very easy to park extremely close to the entrance to the rooms which we liked.  It was easy to navigate in and out as the resort is fairly small.  The room itself, ours faced the parking area, which we didn't really care either way about.  It was close to the pool so that was good enough for us.  However, I will say the bed sucked.  When my husband turned, I too turned and bounced along with him.  They badly need to upgrade to better beds. While not uncomfortable per se, I don't enjoy feeling every teeny movement of my partners.

They had nice toiletries- C.O Bigelow.  I enjoyed those little aspects.

For an hour every evening they had free wine happy hour, which we did check out one of the evenings.  Hey, no one complains about Free Wine!!!  Nothing special, but it did the trick.

Hotel Bar: Had some kick ass cocktails.  Plenty of strength and tasty concoctions.

Biggest Bummer?  The pool area.  Don't get me wrong, it's pretty. First appearances are good.  There is plenty of shade from large palms and such and there's an area for kiddies with sand.  However, there is not enough chairs for the amount of guests.  And the guests that are there put towels on all the chairs even if they aren't around, which is not cool.  Suggestion to hotel:  Perhaps walk around every hour and remove towels if no one's been sitting there for awhile?  It's not fair for a select few to have a chair all day, while others are unable to lay by the pool at all.  And while there is plenty of shade, for me that was another downfall.  Almost too much shade.  It was hard to find areas to sun in compared to those covered by shade.  It made me majorly pissy.  Sun is why I came to AZ.

Overall, a great place close to downtown Scottsdale and a walk away from the mall. Perfect for those who want to spend time near the action.  If you can get a good deal here, it's worth the stay. Plus, they have a free shuttle if you want to go somewhere a few  miles from of the place.  (so you can drink and have a driver)",3

Thanks.

The hostess offered to comp me a drink.  Unfortunately, she evidently didn't tell anyone else, as my drink was still on my tab.  I'm on expense, as I'm here for work, so it really didn't matter enough to argue the point, but come on.  If you promise something, follow through.",3

I had the Grizz which had large portions and my family dabbled in pancakes and French toast. Zero complaints around the table. Their breakfast meats.. sausage, bacon and ham were all incredible. Sometimes the meats are a make or break side for breakfast places, but Black Bear has perfected them. This breakfast experience was probably the best service I have ever experienced at a restaurant.

The menu is large, diverse, though mildly pricey.  If you're looking for Thai on a ramen budget, I recommend Thai Basil on University Dr.  But if you've got $13 for an amazing Thai dinner, I suggest the Drunken Dragon noodles.  Everything I've had here has been flavorful.  

A note about spicy food:  As Thai restaurants go, this one is on the hotter end.  Though I typically order my food ""Thai Hot"" at other restaurants, I typically stick to ""Very Hot"" here because it's sooo hot.  Just a note of caution :)

The service is occasionally at a slower pace than I would like, but I attribute this mostly to their crowds of customers rather than inefficiency.

Perhaps the best reason to go to Malee's for your first Thai meal?  The staff are incredibly good at keeping your water glass full- a necessity when trying those spicy entrees.",2

44230,1,1546473600000,"Made it up to the summit of Thompson Peak, the 3rd highest peak in the McDowell's. One of the most difficult hikes I've ever made. 

Note that it is best to use the Dixie mine trailhead from fountain hills. Shea to Palisades, left on golden eagle road for about 2.5 miles and the trailhead and parking is on the left, just before a gated community. Can't miss it.

Take the Dixie mine trail for about 2 miles or so until you reach a junction that points Dixie mine to the right. You will want to go left and take the road that leads to the summit. This is where it gets very very steep and strenuous. It's one of the steepest roads I've ever trekked on. Needless to say those quads and gluts will be burning. The last 600-700 feet of climbing is absurd. It must be a 40% gradient. It's crazy. Once you reach the top the views are outstanding. 

You're looking at about 4 1/2 hours total and somewhere in the ballpark of 10 miles round trip. It's quite a challenge but very rewarding when reaching the top.",2

If you get the opportunity to come, the tamales (corn and shrimp) and his margaritas (if you like alcohol) are the two MUSTS. Both were really good. I usually don't like tamales (no offense, maybe I've only had bad ones) because they are always so dry, but this one was moist and full of flavor. The corn was the perfect accompaniment too. As for the margarita, you can custom-create your own from their list of tequilas or choose a concocted mix. I had the white peach margarita which was fantastic.

We had the chicken with sweet potato hash and the steak and egg. The first is very unique and very Bobby. It's a little spicy, and it is basically two huge mounds of chicken and hash mixed together. Very creative. The steak and egg was more traditional; you pretty much just make your own fajitas from guacamole, sour cream, egg, peppers, etc. Also good (although not spectacular) because of the fresh ingredients.

I can honestly say they have the atmosphere down and the service was indeed some of the best I have had ever, but the food was subpar. Maybe I ordered wrong, maybe I didn't understand the culinary vision, who knows. Ordered the pork belly tacos- thought they would be on a bun not an undercooked taco shell (seriously a best seller) but I don't get the allure. Difficult to eat with the huge chunks of watermelon, but good caramelization on the meat. The ramen was disgusting - not sure what that was. The nachos were a great idea- fried skins with pimento cheese and pickled okra - OMG get me a cardiologist because there is no way I can say no to that kind of seduction, except for when I could because the pimento cheese lacked seasoning. 

I don't think I will return for the food because to be honest for an innovative tapas place I expect better, but the cucumber mule was amazing especially when they modified it with Gin for me. 

Check it out, the vibe is awesome, but the chef should experiment with some other recipes and/or maybe I went on an off night.",2
30024,1,1546732800000,"Panera Bread ah yes, a wonderful modern day fast food café. Well I do happen to enjoy Panera Bread although it is an ironic modern depiction of what a Café is. They have some pretty tasty almost-homemade soups and sandwiches and some fantastic coffee. A nice bakery to keep your sweet tooth satisfied and your belly full. More specifically though. I despise this location.

I have been to this location a bunch of times (over 20 at least) and every time I go it seems the same kind of disappointing experience. A couple examples:

 First of all the first time I went here in my life I was still in high school and was here just doing some homework. Not one single table was clean so I cleaned it myself. I went to the front and ordered some soup, a coffee, and a water and got to work on some un-important  English paper that I would never remember. The second I opened my laptop to start working, an employee comes over and very rudely says ""how old are you? you can't sit here all night  doing homework."" Keep in mind I had only a few sips from my soup and coffee when she arrived in front of me. 

I look up and say excuse me? So she repeats herself. I said well I am a paying customer and you have free wifi, so if people are welcome to use free wifi and you have coffee and a bakery, what kind of place is this? She proceeded to say that they were a Fast-food Restaurant and that she didn't want to get stuck there after her shift to clean my table. I told her not one of these tables were cleaned when I sat down. She grunted and said ""yeah right"" and trotted away. So, having felt extremely disrespected; packed up my laptop and homework, left my full cup of coffee along with the water and full bowl of soup and walked to the front cash register where her, and her manager were standing. As I walk up I even hear her bitching to her manager about me sitting and doing homework. 

She notices me out of the corner of her eye and immediately stops talking and walks into the back. So I say, ""too late"". I tell the manager I want my money back for what she had just said to me while I was sitting down. I said I did not feel welcome and would like to take my money elsewhere. The manager agreed but only because I had walked up on them talking about me. I got my money back and said I left my entire meal at my table and left. I couldn't believe it.

Quickly 2 others, one for some reason one of the booths was just missing an entire bench. so their replacement was a random chair which I will try to put in the pictures section of this location. Also I just went here today and ordered and just got a very ""hurry up so I can do nothing"" response. No thank you just here is your change and move on.

Again I love Panera but this location is just awful, over crowded, rude employees, and just a lack of convenience to customers (i.e. fixing a booth, cleaning tables, etc.)",2
45533,1,1547942400000,"Of course we've all visited Best Buys tons; however, after repeated disappointing recent visits I feel compelled to write a review of my last annoying visit...

Upon entering, instead of being kindly greeted by the door/podium/obvious loss-prevention guy, I was verbally accosted when he immediately ordered me to hand over my laptop, so he could firmly place a pink sticker on it, before I could proceed any further. Wow...Ok...

So, finally got past security or whatever that was and finally found the Geek Squad customer service area to get my laptop's DVD drive repaired. Next, I was pointed over to the Geek Squad waiting area where two techs were helping two confused old people with their computer problems. No problem, I thought...Im the only one in line, this should go pretty quick...

30 MINUTES LATER!!! One of the techs frees up and I finally get some help. It should be noted, during my entire 30 minute wait a fat lazy manager-looking guy was pacing back and forth in the area, not taking notice of me patiently waiting forever, and instead looked completely confused, lost, and hungry...WTF Thanks so much for your kind help...

I get my laptop taken care of and I decided I want to go look at the cell phones, as my contract is due in 13 days. I can't wait!! :-) A plain looking pale blond comes over and unexcitedly asks if I need any help. I asked her a few basic questions to access her cell phone knowledge and to make her feel useful... 

Well, found out she was indeed, pretty useless, as she did not have a clue about Android operating systems and could not provide basic info regarding Samsung phones offered by any of the carriers. 

Then I asked her, what's the advantage of buying a Sprint phone from Best Buy, as opposed to from the Sprint store. She completely stumbled her way thru this basic core concept that she should be well trained and knowledgeable on as a sales associate. After being annoyed by this complete poor display of salesmanship, I was just about ready to leave...But unfortunately, not before she could try to just get one back at me... 

When I finally found the new Verizon Nexus phone, she  came by to ask me again if I had any questions, I said no I'm just gonna ck out the Nexus. She of course took a cheap shot and informed me it was demo all the while looking at me with disdain and smirking the whole time. 

Needless to say, this surpassed my breaking point and I simply left, not caring if I had the last word in our apparent tit-for-tat exchange....

I have an unusual boba order that I get at pretty much every place I go - avocado smoothie (with real avocado), NO sugar, extra boba.  Of all the boba places, Brew Tea Bar is the best. Their boba is super chewy and fresh. They blend their drinks super well even without sugar. The service is on point - the owner remembered my order perfectly even though I never come in. And if you don't like something they will remake it.

A couple minor complaints: The boba is a tad on the sweet side, but the chewiness makes up for it. I also wish they had more fresh fruit on the menu because I'm more a fan of those in smoothies than the powder. But overall this is my favorite boba place in the area.",2

When the GPS directed me here, I was kinda confused. The last time I had been to this area, the only Starbucks was inside the GE Market District. When Samantha (my GPS voice) told me to turn into this plaza, I got sorta giddy! Tucked off behind some construction and in a corner suite is this cute little Starbucks. When I say little, I mean little. It is definitely one of the smaller locations I have been to. Seating for about 30 maxed out and a smaller retail area as well.

We told him what we needed and while he was checking it out, I figured I'd make small talk over his fabulous Yelp reviews.

He said he asked what that meant and was told they would remove negative reviews if he paid for advertising. Now really, that is how many of these review sites do work, but the fact that this upset him so much; that his customers are entitled to full truth and the mere suggestion to the contrary offended his integrity,  was alarming and admirable. He was honest in his recommendations, not trying to upsell repairs or services and super knowledgeable, patient of all my curious questions.

I found this place by accident when I was filling up my gas tank and crying over the bill, especially since I have to get premium gas. OUCH!  As I was wiping the tears out of my eyes, I saw a beacon of hope just across the parking lot!  Was I really seeing a snowball joint just 25 feet away?!?! I rubbed my eyes and opened them again and it was still there, with a golden halo surrounding it and angels singing Hallelujah in the background!  No joke, it was a totally, magical moment for me!

Anyway, to my review....Polar Snow is a little travel trailer parked in the Chervon parking lot.  You might not see it from the street, but it is there!  They had about 30 flavors available on the day I was there.  They ranged from your regular flavors like banana, cherry, fruit punch to more exotic ones like Tiger's Blood, as well as special flavors the owners have created.  Definitely a flavor or 2 for anyone who pops by.  The also offer several sizes for really cheap!  The smallest was $2 and the largest was $5.  There were also add in options of sweet cream or ice cream for $.50.  Extra yummy goodness right there!

They also had something called the Polar Soda.  It is like an Italian Soda but even better!  I tried it with half vanilla half strawberry and I was in love!  I think what makes it so special is all of the sweet cream they add to the drink.  It was just awesome and I totally recommend it!  As for the snowball, I went with my all time favorite which is the Orange Dreamsicle.  That thing of beauty is an orange snowball covered in sweet cream.  You then mix it all up and you have a spoonful of heaven.  Awww, pure bliss!

The steamed fish is made fresh to order. But get here early in the day - and get it while you can -- once dinner time rolls around they normally run out of the live fish. You can order this as a soup or steamed. We prefer steamed. As soon as we sit down - we like to order the fish right away -- since they need to skin and gut the fish. Take a little bit to cook. So be patient, it's worth the wait. 

We also ordered dumplings - which is handmade and probably the best in town. The one we prefer is made of leeks. You get 15 dumplings in an order for only $7.95. 

The hot pot cauliflower is to die for. It's made with a fatty bacon - and the aroma it gives off is sooooo good!

The snow cabbage is a new item, but for a few bucks - definitely worth it - if you're looking for some veggies. 

The cucumber is always good! Served with peanuts and chili oil. 

The lamb is surprising good. Good Gamey taste, sliced super thin. A bit of kick to the taste buds. The spice in this dish is addicting. 

The green bean dish is marinated with vinegar and has an amazing sting to it. The crunch of the beans makes this dish a ""hard to stop eating"" dish. 

The chicken gizzard is a generous portion - for only $7. You also get beans with it too!

They also have buy 1 get 1 free milk or Thai tea! The boba is not to my liking - but the tea itself is pretty decent. 

The fish filet with sour cabbage soup is HUGE and only $8. If you're a fan of tamarind - you will love this soup! we order it almost everytime we come. The soup is enough to feed 4-6 people. 

Everything on the menu is cheap compared to the amount of the food you get! 

This is my new favorite restaurant and hoping it gets enough business to stay open.

40058,1,1548115200000,"My friend and I are vegetarian and thought Fresh was a great idea for a niceThursday lunch to celebrate his recent promotion. He got the 'Beach' bowl for $14, which was supposed to have fried zucchini and peppers, dried tomatoes, sprouts and avodado on a bed of brown rice. 

Now, if someone comes over your house and you're cooking for them, you don't just put a bunch of cut ingredients in a bowl and serve it, do you? No, you do something with it -- cut up the veggies, toss it, add some sort of spices or flavouring, etc. Instead they serve the saddest looking restaurant meal we had ever seen: just some uncut cooked veggies on a bed of very oily brown rice. Unappetizing to say the least.

I myself got the bbq veggie burger. It was uninspring, but nothing I can complain about too much -- basically just a normal veggie burger. I also asked if they could put a bit of red onion on my burger because I love red onion and noticed it didn't have it.

My friend then decides to order fries to fill himself up because his meal is so bad. Somehow, they also messed up the fries, which were still raw in the middle. We were quite fed up by this point and sent them back.

Finally, the bill comes and they've had the nerve to charge $2 for a bit of red onion on my burger. Apparently, $10 for a veg burger without fries wasn't enough, and the red onion counted as a 'side.' Earning loyal customers right there they are.

This was the final straw. We call the manager over and explain the list of complaints, with the point that after all that the last thing they should be charging for is $2 two raw red onion rings. She brusquely replies, ""Well if you didn't like your meal you should have told us and we'd take it off.  As for the onions, it's an extra and that's $2."" Two things about this. First off, we all get bad meals in restaurants, and very few of us send it back. It's just something that happens. Second of all, you shouldn't mess up fries no matter what. Third of all, any restaurant that wants customer loyalty should not charge their customers $2 for a bit of onion on a burger. And if they do, warn the customer when they order as a courtesy.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic, it was a great mix of a date night spot, but also a casual place to enjoy others company. The lighting was dim, great music, attentive staff, and the decor really gave the place a relaxed feel. My gf and I were sat at the end of the bar because all tables were already reserved. We had a great view of the kitchen, so we were able to see the chefs working hard to make delicious food. Unfortunately, I felt really cramped and uncomfortable with no room to scoot over because all of the other seats were taken at the bar. This review would be 4.5 if yelp allowed increments. Now for the food!

We ordered the ceviche, chicken fried lobster, and the PBR hot pot. The ceviche is one of the best I have ever tasted. The seafood tasted fresh and even better with the purée they made with the habaneros. It gave the dish a sweet and tangy taste. The ceviche came with sweet potato chips for a greatly paired crunchy element. 

My gf ordered the chicken fried lobster, the batter was light and the chicken was juicy. What really made it stand out was the sauce that accompanied it. 

The PBR hot pot I ordered was the dish that really stood out me. The broth! Wow, I was slurping every ounce of it. The perfectly cooked seafood and Bok choy took a back seat to the broth. Maybe it was the PBR, or maybe It was the smooth and salty taste of the broth; either way it was delicious. Make sure to order a side of rice with this!",1

What a horrible experience. Packed, lines for the buffet were 30mins+ because they seated people at specific times so intake seating was all at the same time. I would prefer Mandarin as opposed to this establishment. 
Horrid planned seating times but clever money saving. Had I not been there for another person's special occasion I would have left within seconds of entering the door. 
Food was disappointing, nothing stood out or was vaguely appetizing. After 1 partial plate of sushi and hot foods I opted to save myself any further annoyance and skip the rest. The desserts were enjoyed by those with me but once more it's was nothing outstanding.

Looking at the menu there's nothing bad to say. It's a simple selection of very basic dishes. Each one we had was wonderful in taste, texture and price. 

However, in short order; the appetizers and main entries were cold to luke warm, the ambiance was sterile to blasé, and the service service was below sub-par.

-Onion Rings
- Jewels on Toast- Ceasar with Crispy Chicken Skin

They were both fantastic. The dumplings were absolutely incredible.

For our dinner:

-My mom got the filet- medium rare- cooked perfectly
-I got the lamb chops- also cooked perfectly and the best chops I've ever had. 

We shared a side of the Mac and Cheese. I'm not a huge fan of bacon or 'smokey' flavors, so it wasn't my favorite, but my mom loved it.

Too much sweet and not enough to balance it out.    

Jose had said that they just changed that dish and it used to have a grilled bread as a side which would have been a better pairing.

As much as we really wanted to love this show, we just didn't. The absolute worst thing about it was the terrible sound quality. It makes it pretty hard to like something when you can't understand 90% of what the actors are saying/singing. While a good portion of this can be blamed on the crappy sound system in the theater, the actors certainly played their part in it as well. 

The actress who portrayed Cheryl (Ash's sister) was UNBEARABLE. Her high pitched, whiny, drawn out dialog became harder and harder to understand as the show went on. During the few times we were able to understand her, we just got an earful of the worst puns ever written. It got to the point where every time she showed up on the stage I was cringing in my seat just wishing for her to go away. 

Another disappointment was the execution of the ""Splatter Zone."" It was a very strange choice to have the blood spray coming from a couple of random guys off to the side of the stage who had nothing to do with the show. It would have been way more entertaining for everyone to see the blood coming from the action on stage. 

By the time intermission came around, we were both ready for the show to be over. Though we did stay until the end, it was a challenge not to fall asleep during the second half. This experience was a huge let down and I am thankful that we did not pay full price for these tickets.

MILK TEA: If you're looking for good HK-style milk tea, this place will not let you down. Tea is rich, at the same time the milk is thick. Syrup is integrated. I have no complaints.

Their quality is good, don't get me wrong, but portion sizes are small, and menu options are... unusual (not strange! but definitely not your usual standard HK-cafe choices!)

Only certain limited items on their lunch or dinner menu will come with a soup and drink - and I personally don't like the choices offered. Menu is kind of difficult to grasp, fonts are small and could be more organized. But all in all, most standard HK Chinese dishes are there, but pricey for what it's worth! You might as well go eat at a food court and you'll get greater quantity!",2

Being so close to the end of Fremont St by the stage, our room was very loud but, it's understandable down here. I'm really pleasantly surprised at how clean our room is! 

We ate dinner at hash house which is an absolute must - the basic is the best! For much cheaper than we usually pay at another hotel on Fremont street it is 100% worth it. The staff was fantastic, especially Ashley at the players club desk!!",2

46092,1,1546992000000,"So went in to the salon today ( first time ever) and got s mani pedi. Pedicure was decent except it took Forever and he water was super cold by the end of it and the guy did not understand what I wanted. I asked for a pink and white ombré. He told me that's not a thing for toes... k I've had it done before but maybe his skill level wasn't what it needed to be. Fine. So I told him to do pink and then glitter on the big toe at the base and fade it up. NOT what I got. I was already really annoyed at this point because it was taking forever and there wasn't a wait. I want to get my nails done and I asked for an acrylic overlay and then just a simple ombré. Don't know why this is so hard to understand so I showed her a picture. I ended up picking two nail polishes I liked more than the pink on my toes to make the ombré and she said it would work. All she did was paint them pink and then paint them white. I had to ask her to paint another layer of polish on because they were streaky and looked bad.  There's supposed to be a 10% new customer discount that I wasn't given and they have stamp cards you're supposed to get a punch for each visit - I also wasn't given one of those. I now have white nails with barley any acrylic and they're streaky and then my toes are a bubblegum pink with streaky glitter. All in all I'm pissed I just spent 55 dollars for my nails to look like I did them at home. Which is weird because other reviews have said their pedicures are 18- I paid 18 and I have no idea why my nails cost so much 
The whole point of me getting my nails and toes done at the same time is to match and they couldn't be any more different. I spent like 2 hours there and left feeling worse than when I went in. 

WILL NOT BE GOING BACK 
I do not recommend. I attached the picture I showed her and what my nails/ toes look li



Update : it's now been a full week and I removed the polish ( because it's chipped AF ) and just as I stated last time there wasn't enough acrylic applied and there are TONS of chips and almost all the nails are lifting. 
C'mon.. you can't be THAT bad?!? I work in an office and I've never had a problem with my nails lifting or ACRYLIC chipping. Like- how does that even happen!?

46092,2,1547164800000,"I agree with previous posts. Tons of potential, has some growing pains to work through.

Pros: pleasant staff. They are hard working and it was BUSY. Engaging, hardworking. No complaints. They also have a great outdoor scene with plenty of space. And HEATERS!! Overhead heaters that made it tolerable to sit outside when it was chilly. You win on that one. Lots of great beers, too. Good selection broken down on the draft list by types, which is helpful.

Cons: process. The wrong draft list was on our table. They have a number system for their beers, so a ""13"" was actually an ""18"" because an old list was floating out there. And because the person who got it drank about half before he said something, we were charged for the mistake. Food. It's just okay. Pretzels were so-so, nachos were just not good. They need to take more pride in presentation and a lot of that could be resolved.

It's a cool place and will likely be well attended for the area it's in. I'd go back in a while when they get into their groove.",2

It is also a good spot for after work. Had occasion to come on a Saturday evening to meet some friends. I was disappointed at the lack of clientele. There was a  two-piece band performing covers - decently I should add. Service was good. Food was good. I  just don't understand how this can be.

23832,1,1547164800000,"Overall, a good experience, but let me break it down for you:

THINGS THAT WERE AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED

-Staff. Arguably the best. Authentic, attentive, knowledgeable, they did their job with ease.
-Wine. Unreal selection. Variety of price ranges, with no scores below 85 (that I found). 
-Food. So... freaking... good. These guys have French cuisine nailed.

THINGS THAT WERE NOT AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED

-THE VIEW. This is really what I came here to talk about. Yes, there is indeed a lake in the sense that there is water and things can float on it. It's more of a pond. It has an apartment complex overlooking it. It's not authentic at all. Completely overblown.
-Romantic ambiance. The music was, eh. There were candles, I guess. There were a lot of events around us like weddings and receptions. But it was a small step above an average chain restaurant. I'd have to say in many cases I've seen chains do romance better. It's really just a place.
-Price. Be prepared to throw down, especially if you order drinks.

I feel like you can do better for the price. The place is in a strip mall. Even a place in Red Rock casino up the street is going to do better.",2

42766,3,1547596800000,"One of the few places that none of us had ever been to... the perfect recipe for success. At least this time it was. 

I hate deviled eggs. I like theirs. Deep fry anything I think I could at least try it... anything. I took one bite I was like this is yummy, and then I tasted the hard boiled egg, it's the texture really, but I highly recommend it to the deviled egg inclined.

Beer cheese and pretzels. It is hard to screw up a pretzel so, they nailed that. The beer cheese I had low expectations for. Just the perfect amount of beer flavor. Too many times I have had beer cheese that tastes like... just beer, not cheese at all. It was delightful.

Pork belly sandwich. I wish we would have got so much more of this. Delicious, tender belly. Tasty sauce and overall just a stellar experience without much expectation. 

THE VERDICT:
Go and get yourself some pork belly. The perfect amount of food for three people who weren't very hungry when they went, and it still tickled our stomach to the maximum. No leftovers and nothing was overly expensive. I don't know what the number 595 stands for... but you need it. Believe me. Okay... maybe not need.",2

There was plenty of room both in the dining room and in the pleasant patio.  My husband got the Home style Scramble and I had pancakes and bacon.

#1) Get reservations. 
#2) Go for lunch or breakfast
#3) ask questions before ordering the first thing that calls to you.

I went after having read the menu and Yelp reviews but * in spite of reading the yelp reviews. I'll admit my expectations were low and it was better than I expected but to say I'd go back... eh. probably not. there are too many restaurants in town to say I'd go back. But my bf loves B.Flay and he was happy so thats all that matters.

APPETIZER: Queso fundido.. How can you go wrong with creamy ovenhot cheese w/ chips? We both agreed this was the best thing and star of the night. If I had it to do over again I'd have ordered 2 apps for my dinner.and called it a night. 

ENTREE: I ordered the 16 spice chicken mole. Really good but it had the skin on it which I never eat skin on chicken - and peeled it off, which also peels of the great 16 spice chicken ..but the mole was good. 
My bf ordered the pork tenderloin which so did the lady sitting next to us - literally I could have hit my neighbor @ the nxt table in the ribs without leaning over. YEP it was that close. 

SIDES: my bfs plate came with some kind of tamale - dry. I ordered the pumpkin spice tamale as a side: dry w/ too much star of anise. thats all I could taste. IT all sounds good in theory, but its not. I dont recall what else my bf ordered as a side... guess u could say it was forgettable. 

No drinks or dessert and tab was $110. Nope.. could have had 2 awesome dinners elsewhere for that price, not including tip to the waitress who was great.  Felt kinda bad for the staff b/c they looked like ants in a farm - everyone doing something so dillitgently but there's so many- they must rely on tips that or thats why the prices are so high. 

As I left couldnt help but wish I'd gone to one of the other restaurants in the Forum Shops. Hell, even Cheesecake factory tasted better. 
But I give 3 stars - one for service, one for creativity for different tasting dishes. and 2 for ambiance. but I take away for having to practially sit in my neighbors chair with him (now I know who they watch on tv and who they are fans of in the NFL and why their daughter doesnt want to finish college) 

TIP#4)Oh yeah and if you dont make ur reservation (must cancel by 3PM) and if u dont make it or dont cancel its $50 a person !!

TIP#5)if you are not a member of the caesars palace points thing - you have to give ur credit card info to even make that reservation so they can charge accordingly.  So its just as pricy to go as it is not to go.",1

I was picked up in the car I would eventually be renting. I would have thought the driver stole the car, the way he was driving it, running yellow lights and throwing it into corners. 

I had to drive the car out of town that night and there was only 1/4 tank of fuel in it. How hard is it to fill up the damn tank before someone rents it? They said to bring it back with a 1/4 tank.

I was skeptical at first as I've never done mobile auto detailing before, let alone via a coupon. 
Louie was super nice when he came up to my workplace. He told me it would be about an hour and a half. 

A little primer: My car has a black interior. The most I do is vacuum the inside every month. 
I'll probably wipe the inside every time a black president gets elected. 
So the console, dash, etc was extremely dusty. 
Wiping it with a damp microfiber cloth didn't do too much for me. 

After Louie was done with it, my car looked brand new. 
The outside, including the tires and rims, were sparkling clean. 
I'm surprised they were able to get it that clean using a water-less solution. 
The inside was even more impressive. Everything looked like it came straight from the dealership, and the shampoo of the seats and floor left a great, clean smell.
The most impressive thing? They were able to get every single crevice inside!
I immediately brought a couple of my co-workers outside to inspect. 
One wiped my rim with his finger, no joke, Mary Poppins style. Clean.

one of my friends has dietary restrictions and needs to have gluten-free items. When I had called to make the dinner reservation, I had asked and the hostess said, yes, we do have gluten-free items that are not just salads. Just let the server know when you come in.

excited to find another gluten-free place in town, my friends and I show up for the reservation. Upon arrival, the server was really nice and friendly. When we had asked about the gluten-free options, the answer was unfortunately as we do not cook our foods separately, the only gluten-free items are salads. Which was a disppointment to us, as we had specifically asked if there were gluten-free items that weren't salads on the menu.

So we decided to just order a couple of apps and drinks as we have been sitting there for quite some time, and it wasn't the server's fault that there wasn't any gluten-free items (we felt bad to just get up and leave).

I'm not huge on fast food but when the family request to stop hey what can I do? Fall into temptation and order something light.. Drive-thru is always my first choice because I am lazy and hate going inside, only way that happens is if I had something wrong with my order. Tonight that wasn't the case thank GOD! Young girl who was taking orders was very pleasant and had great customer service skills I'm sure Ronald McDonald would be proud lol. Our order was requested to be made fresh as I know that in fast food if you don't request it fresh there is a highly possible chance you will get something that's been sitting in that tray for who knows how long. Learned my lesson too many times so FRESH is the way to go!. In this case we were asked to park as they were still preparing. Order came out within about 7 minutes everything was correct!

I was quite impressed with the staff's knowledge of their menu and efficiency especially since they just opened not so long ago. They were all very friendly too. I ordered the seafood tomato cream udon and picked the chicken and fish tempura as my sides.  By the time I got my drink (Free drink if you check in on YELP) and picked a place to sit, my udon was ready.  It came in a huge bowl, so it didn't look like a lot of udon inside.  But to my surprise, I couldn't even finish it all and had leftovers to take home.  The udon was freshly made and tasted so good.  The tempura was equally as tasty.  The menu items are reasonably priced.  I used to have to go out to LA to have some good udon.  I am so glad that they have this type of restaurant in Vegas now.

Definitely try the bacon jam biscuits with the quail egg - easily the best thing I've ever eaten in Phoenix, a true gem.

The flat breads were decent.  Also had the BBQ ribs and homemade tots - all of which were tasty in small quantities, which is exactly what tapas are meant to be.

The atmosphere is a bit hotel-ish and overly modern hipster.  Even the wait staff is overly-casual in attire, although they were all quite friendly and attentive.

25583,3,1546473600000,"PLEASE TAKE NOTE!! All Glass Nickle Pizza joints are different. This location is by far my favorite, the East Side being my least. The folks on Atwood Avenue need to take note. If it was just one bad experience Id feel different, but it was 3 in a row at Atwood and management didn't back me up. Anyways, Ive had 3 GREAT deliveries from this location in a row, prompting this review. So here goes:

Service - Excellent! The lady on the phone was very polite and efficient, she quoted 45 minutes for a sandwich and appetizer. Quick conversation  and order was finished with credit card in under 3 minutes. Food only took 25 minutes, delivery guy was very polite and equally efficient. Food was hot. No complaints! Was about a 5 mile drive. 10/10

Food Quality - Once again excellent! I had the chicken cordon bleu hot sandwich and deep fried raviolli. Both items were hot and delicious. My only complaint is not enough honey mustard on sandwich, made it a little dry. Next time ill ask for extra. 9/10

Price - My main complaint with Glass Nickle. At least the food and service were great. I paid $17 with tip for both items. A little steep for lunch. Although the portion of fried raviollis was enough, i would have rather had a smaller portion and sandwich for $10 before tip. No sides or chips come with the sandwich, they used too but oh well. 4/10

Overall - 23/30 - 4 stars. If it were a little cheaper it would be 5 easy.

Note - The pizza is also fantastic, the crust could use a little work but thats all my personal taste. This was more a service review.",2

He was sure nice enough, but kept coming back to clarify our orders, we had to go get our own napkins/silverware because he gave us our food but not with the necessary silverware, and he was very slow to come back to check on us and refill our drinks.  Worst of all, he brought AC's salad without the deviled eggs and didn't explain that they were out of cooked eggs until after we brought it to his attention.  He apologized and seemed sincere, but the service left a lot to be desired.

Service was attentive and friendly, but would've liked to have been asked if we were done with our dishes and drinks before they so efficiently stealthed by to take them away before we were done.

We ordered the apple fritters, too, and our 5-year-old couldn't stop licking the sugar off his fingers.  

The building is really interesting, and I like the variety of seating options (outside, inside, high-top, booth, etc...).  And I know this might be a weird thing to comment on, but the bathrooms are worth a mention.  They're very retro, with Barbie & G.I. Joe dolls encased in the walls.  There's a T.V. playing old 50's shows, too.  In the bathroom.  Yep.

The pool area blows...so over packed and just full of people sleeping or frying on beach towels on the cement. We did not last long here, and convinced our friends to come back to our pool area (MGM Grand), which is just 100 times nicer, entertaining (lazy river, waterfalls etc) and spacious.

The casino floor is pretty cool though and for that it will not get 2 stars. This place wreaks of old school Vegas, and the rat pack were regulars here. The dining options looked good, but we did not par take.

They do have low prices for rooms, so if you see a deal...book it and enjoy a decent hotel in a great spot on the strip.",3

The first time I got a Banh Mi Thit Nuong and the second time I got the Com Thit Nuong. The first two times I thought the food was decent, especially with their Thit Nuong and the fish sauce that came with the rice. However, after the third time they stepped up their game. The third time I went here the owner has been so kind to let us stay here a little longer after our long road trip. I tried their Bun Bo Hue and it was phenomenal. I grew up eating Vietnamese food all of the time and I've always preferred home cooked meals then going out to Vietnamese restaurants. I was impressed with the flavors in the Bun Bo Hue, however it did had a little kick. If you don't like spicy, I highly not recommend this. I came back to get the Com Thit Nuong and their fish sauce tasted so much better this time. I can't wait to try some other items they have in their menu!",2

The spice range, and the way they're packaged = 5 stars.

The prices? Well.. they're a bit more pricey compared to where else I can purchase them (namely organic grocery stores).

I also am not really keen on not being able to look at the spices or give them a sniff to see if they're old or not.

That said, I LOVE the layout of the shop, it smells like heaven when you walk in, you can find obscure spices for the most part, and the shelf for salt made my heart flutter.",2

La Gourmandine is a delightful little bakery with a cute space and delicious, beautifully crafted pastries and cakes.  Everything I have tried here is awesome, but being obsessed with chocolate, I especially love their Pan Au Chocolat and the Opera and Chocolate-mousse-based pastry cakes.

The absolute best thing about La Gourmandine, though, is their BREAD.  Holy smokes, best french baguette I have ever had in Pittsburgh (and maybe anywhere in the US) -- admittedly, I'm not a french baguette connoisseur, but I do have taste buds!

Although I have yet to try many of the things at Jean-Marc's, including a croissant comparison across the two bakeries, I will say that my one experience with bread at Jean-Marc's does not hold a candle to La Gourmandine's baguette.

Their sandwiches are also delicious.  The other day, I accidentally schlepped down Butler to have one of their amazing sandwiches for lunch while they were on vacation, and I'm not sure I've ever been so disappointed upon arriving at a closed food venue before.

Everything they sell is quite reasonably priced.  I am appreciating that much more now that another bakery (Gaby et Jules) with much higher prices has opened.  On Saturday and Sunday mornings, expect reasonably long lines (up until about 11:30am or so).",2

It's a cute place that offers Brazilian food.  The lunch menu is a bit limited but for a person like me that gets overwhelmed by too many choices that was just fine for me.  The servers were all very pleasant and extremely polite - I was impressed.

I ordered the bean soup (forgot the name but it comes in a glass and not a bowl) and the cod croquettes.  My friend ordered the french toast.  My cod were extremely salty....so much so I couldn't finish it.  The soup was ok but a tiny bit bland.  It had black beans in it with some steamed kale and you are given an orange slice to eat afterwards as a palate cleanser.  However my friend raved about her french toast which more looked like croissant toast with some chocolate drizzled on - she licked the plate clean!  

They seem to serve traditional Brazilian food here so I am curious to try some of their other offerings (dinner menu).",2

For anyone that is new to this sort of thing, their menu has a mixture of sodas and add-ons that make a unique tasting drink. They also offer things like Red Bull, and snacks like cookies. I got the Busta Limes, which was sweet, bubbly, and just perfect, as well as a sugar cookie, topped with buttercream (?) frosting. As a sugar fiend, I was definitely pleased, and if I ever have a bad day, I know where I am heading. Definitely don't make it a habit, cause this place screams diabetes",2

My parents used to take me to splash in the water fountain and roll down the grassy hills while listening to Sunday afternoon concerts here. I went on picnic dates with my boyfriend here. I was proposed to here. I had my wedding pictures here. I've been to countless festivals here. Okay, you get it.

If the weather is nice, there's no event going on, and it's a weekend, expect there to be at least fifteen photographers leading newly engaged couples, families, wedding entourages, and gussied up pregnant ladies through all your favorite Civic Center spots. Last weekend, I had to wait for three photographers to slowly make their way through my favorite fountain before I finally got the opportunity to splash around like an obviously full grown adult. Don't you judge me.

The grass is always green and so perfect for relaxing in and staring at the clouds. Or go sit under a tree and do some people watching, my favorite pastime! And when you're done relaxing, go get a beer on the patio of Old Town Tavern or a margarita at Distrito and do some more people watching. Oh wait, that's still relaxing. Maybe go get a book from the Civic Center library? Hey, that's still relaxing! Shoot.

It was an awkward time to be grabbing dinner, so that's at least part of the reason. I just got takeout, so I can't speak about the dining service at all, though the front counter lady was nice and pleasant. 

The ribs were good- moist and flavorful,  the smoked turkey was good- not too dry and a good turkey flavor, the Memphis Sweet BBQ sauce was good, the Au Gratin potatoes were good but too salty, and the applesauce tasted like pureed applesauce from a jar but with bigger chunks of apple inside. 

For what I ordered, the price was similar to Hickory River and Black Dog, though Black Dog (for at least some of their items) uses locally sourced ingredients, which I like. The ribs were similar in size to Hickory River though smaller than Black Dog though the flavor was good. 

I wouldn't have compared this place to Black Dog because it's sort of a different thing, but with prices being similar, you might as well go to the one you like best. We live in Savoy, so for us, the convenience might outweigh my preferences at times. 

I used the word ""good"" many times to describe the food because I found it to be just that. It fulfilled my BBQ craving adequately. As far as it being mind blowing or amazing, I wouldn't say that, but it does what it's supposed to do and satisfies.",3

49977,3,1547856000000,"For a post V-day boys break, my two friends and I went to Saffron for body scrubs. Yes, you can scrub at home but why not let someone else to do it for you for half the price spas on the strip cost. I had the ginger bread scrub. The smell was heavenly to me (I like bakery smells).  From the beginning to the end, I felt comfortable. The lady (I forgot her name) was gentle yet effective. After the scrub, I took a shower. My skin felt so good. I did notice they do not use ""spa"" soaps but for the cost I didn't mind. They did provide a thick lotion to complement the scrub after the shower. I would go back again.",3
37219,2,1548633600000,"I ordered fish and chips. Two bites into my fish, I realize the middle of the fillet was raw. I sent it back, and I was polite about it. It's not the server's fault. My food was replaced no problem, however I'm a bit upset that I was still charged full price for my meal.  I feel that, when food is undercooked and sent back, it should be complimentary. I will not be returning to this restaurant because of my bill and no apologizes made for the undercooked fish.",2
