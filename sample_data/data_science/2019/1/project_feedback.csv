7,3,1547337600000,"OMG...... Let's start with the desserts first. Heaven!!!! Warm peanut butter cup is to die for and a must try. The salted caramel is amazing as well and full of flavor and worth the awards. We indulged and had be chocolate cake as well and it was rich and good but a little dry for a molten. Let's pause on all that for a minute. 
Ok going back to the food. We had the butchers plate which had some great choices on the charcuterie and then followed it up with dinner. For the table of three we had the fried chicken and biscuit, the sweet potato tortellini and the short rib stew. All three were good and well flavored. I could have taken a little more spice but it was seasoned well. Drinks special we had the polish and the old fashioned and both were on points 
Overall a great pick for dtown Phoenix with good service and a great fun atmosphere. Highly recommend",2

Second time I've been here and it's so gross! 
This is close to my new house so I hope they fix it before I find another grocery store. I have always liked fru's but I'd rather not be nauseous while grocery shopping.",2
17,2,1546819200000,"It's an easy decision to drive from Summerlin to Bronze Cafe at The Center when you know there's such DELICIOUS food to be had.  My husband and I love the Tree of Life and Roasted Veggie Sandwiches, accompanied by a watermelon chia drink, and topped off with either (or both) the vegan cheesecake and vegan strawberry cookies.  Our son loves the LGBTQ sandwich.  All the sides are yummy as well.  I can't wait to try the rest of the vegan options on the menu.  Again, totally worth the drive!",2
19,3,1548547200000,"Soooo, my wife and I typically go to fro yo places. We decided to stop out an old fav tonight and wow we were not disappointed. My ice cream took me back to when I was younger and my grandma would take me here. I am a huge fam of chocolate and peanut butter, really who isn't? I got the dark chocolate with Reese's peanut butter cups and a scoop of peanut butter. It was on fleek! They have a ton of different choices of ice cream to satisfy you taste buds. An assortment of toppings from snickers to gummy bears. The customer service was excellent very polite and didn't get angry when I asked for samples of all hahaha.",2

20,2,1548028800000,"last week we gave this a try and were not disappointed..the decor and open feeling of the resturant and  kitchen. very attentive staff (lots of them) which was nice. drinks were good i had a"" pain killer"" which brought me back to my days on St john's island..nice ...had appitizers  grits and shirners sausage, and zuccunni pancakes.  our table had several entrees and due to other posts about the mussels i warned my friends what i had read ..but someone ordered them and to overwhelming reviews from the table they were very good. green chile stew good but small portion for a entree. chicken with mustard sauce was excellend. desserts ..not a smores fan but everyone else liked them also the peachs and cream was nice cool and refreshing end to a great dinner.  so give it a try ..we had a great meal and a good time..",1

22,1,1547942400000,"Came here for dinner at 6pm on a Saturday night as it was close by to the Phoenix Concert Theatre. From the outside, it is hard to spot as it is on the lower story - you have to walk down a flight of stairs and there is a black curtain that covers the door. It's a cozy restaurant with seating for around 25 people, but we were seated right away as it wasn't too packed yet. 

I ordered the Jerk Chicken Pasta, while my friend ordered the Jerk Chicken Dinner, and we were so impressed. Generous portions of chicken (which tasted amazing), and the pasta was a creamy, buttery, cheesy sauce - so delicious. The bill came to around $15/person (including tax/tip), and it was definitely worth it, we were so full. 

The waitress we had was very friendly, but she left halfway through our meal and service was slower once she was gone with only 2 servers remaining ( it took a while to get the bill).

Will definitely be back to try out their brunch menu!",2
22,2,1547596800000,"The food is okay. Typical chain fare. The problem we have in EVERY Olive Garden is the way they pace the service of the meal. I do not like getting my entrée 3 minutes after being served my soup/salad. I want to be able to enjoy my soup without the entrée getting cold. When I remember, I have asked the wait staff to hold off on the entrée and they'll do it. 
It is apparently the way they operate to quickly turn the table. Unfortunately it makes us feel rushed to get out of the place. 
Not good.",2
29,1,1547596800000,"I've been hesitant to try Pasta Bar since they first opened.  We've been to Turf half a dozen times and usually it is the price-point that keeps me from wandering to the back of the complex and trying Pasta Bar.  I finally got my mother to take us out so that I didn't have to pay for it.  

Pasta Bar seems to have the worst location of the three restaurants in the complex.  There is no patio, no windows, and no personality.  It is too bad because Italian places are always begging for style.  A mirror, a few paintings, some duct work, and a nicely-crafted bar sort of make up the entire ambiance of  PB.

The place was dead when we got there.  It was Saturday afternoon and Turf seemed to be pretty busy.  The waitress was helpful and informative when we got in and we looked over the lunch menu.  They had a lunch special where you picked lemonade or tea, got a salad, and a different type of cavatelli.  I had lemonade and the pesto pasta.  

The lemonade was the most sour thing I had ever drank.  In fact, I think it was made of liquefied lemon Warheads.  No amount of sugar was going to make this drinkable.  It was pretty disappointing.  

As far as the breadstick thing goes, they were fine.  I think I would rather them bring out a basket of breadsticks instead of them sitting on the table like a package of chopsticks.  They taste fine.

My pasta really wasn't that great.  The pesto was nice and light, which was a bit surprising.  It tasted good but could have had more garlic.  The pasta, however, was undercooked and rubbery.  I love non-flour pasta and I will almost always order gnocci or cavatelli if they are available and this was simply not that great.  It was fine but could have been better.

The salad was actually worse than the salad that comes with the Fez Burger.  I didn't think such a thing was possible, but Pasta Bar has figured out how to make it.  They apparently take an entire stalk of celery and chop it up and throw it in with 5 pieces of lettuce and an orange tomato.  The celery taste was so overwhelming that I couldn't possible eat more than two bites of it.  That's fine, I don't go to a pasta place for the salad, but I would have been fine with a traditional salad.

In all, the lunch special for $12 is a fine deal.  The pasta is decent.  My mother had the other cavatelli (with the pomodoro sauce).  It was much better than mine.  I can't give this place a bad review but I would probably not go back.  With so many other food options next door or just down the rail/street, it is hard to see myself going back.",2
29,2,1548201600000,"Sarah was our server, sweet as the dessert on their menu & took good care of all 5 of us! Sugar bowl reminds me of the old fashioned ice cream parlors I've only seen on black and white tv. They have burgers & sandwiches, not just dessert as I had imagined driving by all these years.Of course this girl had dessert, the Desireme Banana Split, yes still living in sweats and pajama jeans or Thanksgiving pants as our server coined them! Worth it, right down to the last drop of marshmellow sauce!!! There unfortunately was an issue with my Patty melt, I'm not one to complain but the thing was still mooing, they were swift to correct the issue(at no charge)and exchanged it for a quieter, more cooked version! We all enjoyed dessert, dinner & even games in their arcade, it was a fabulous family night out!",1
31,1,1547251200000,"We found this place not busy at 6:30 on a Friday evening so good for us to get a seat but one wonders their busy time - maybe later for drinking. 

The guacamole appetizer was the best part of the meal as the fish tacos below par.  

There is no pretense here about being upscale.  It seems set up to be a neighborhood bar mainly for drinking with the food to have something to do between drinks.",2
32,3,1546646400000,"Nice hotel, friendly staff. Stayed at the GO room. Nice view. The only issue is that people don't respect the non-smoking section. You smokers suck!!",2
33,3,1548547200000,"Made reservations for an early dinner. Our table was ready for us when we got here. The service was great with all members of the wait staff really attentive and polite. The waitress offered good recommendations and we started with the calamari appetizer. The calamari was so light and tasty. We ordered rolls and a shashimi plate. The sushi is extremely fresh. To end the meal, I definitely recommend the strawberry soufflé. It was perfect. Well worth a trip to Mandalay Bay!",2
35,1,1548460800000,"I couldn't resist and finally stepped into Sasaki to try their famed daifuku. Normally I am only a fan when it is the ice cream kind, straight from the freezer, but there was so much talk about them being amazing, I had to try it for myself... and it did not disappoint!

They are now $2.60 each. I tried houjicha, black sesame, matcha and strawberry. I am already a huge red bean fan, and with the matcha, it was just divine. Houjicha and black sesame are my favourite macaron flavours and they are also very good in the daifuku. I wish the strawberry one reminded me of the yummy ones in Japan, but even though it didn't, it was still refreshing. Of course if there was chestnut flavour today, that would have been a no brainer. Would have picked it up in a heartbeat!

The shop is located in J-Town's supermarket - at the far end (opposite of the cafe).

Give Sasaki Fine Pastry a try today, you'll be glad you did! :)",2
37,2,1548288000000,Awesome place.  Great margaritas.  Delicious rib eye tacos and the mariachi is worth coming back to visit,3
38,2,1546473600000,"Loftti has modern and also classic decoration that goes really well. Every teas are in high quality and the prices are very reasonable. Try the earlgray milk tea, its the best milk tea i ever had in my life.",2
40,1,1548633600000,this is true Cleveland. No visit to the city would be complete without a Steve's Gyro. it's located inside the Westside market in Ohio City. I always get the regular but the jumbos available. These things are huge and delicious. always a line and expect to wait but totally worth it.,2
44,2,1546992000000,"The gyro might be huge but huge isn't always a good thing.  The pita bread is delicious however everything else is subpar. You can't really mess up tomatoes and onions but the meat was super dry, almost to the point of eating beef jerky dry. The tatziki sauce was bland, if you're going to call it your ""signature cucumber sauce"" it better be something good.  It tasted like plain Greek yogurt, no spices at all.  For an $8 price tag it delivers with $2 flavor. A huge dissapointment.",2
49,3,1547078400000,"I still love Hingetown. I think its such a cool little stretch of Cleveland. Some of my favorite places are here including Urban Orchid floral, Cleveland Tea Revival and Beet Jar, though I frequent most of the businesses here and have unique love for them all. They're all owned by passionate, cool locals who believe in what they do.

But mostly, this update is just to show appreciation for a few things I often forget about Hingetown- how dog-friendly every business is, the beautifully manicured living wall, and the fact that the Transformer Station (a satellite CMA location) even exists here. I mean, where else can you pet tons of good doggos, see world class art and grab lunch? Since the last time I wrote this, new businesses like Larder Delicatessen, Saucy Brew Works and Title Kickboxing have opened. I can tell the people behind Hingetown are really trying to continuously add and improve. Still 5-stars in 2018!",2

64,2,1548288000000,"The one is solely for their complete lack of regard for food allergies. My husband and I went to dinner last night and he informed our waitress that he is allergic to both tree nuts and peanuts. We go to order dessert and he picks the bread pudding for us to share (we have had nut free bread pudding at lots of other restaurants). When it gets there I take a bite and panic as I realize there are chunks of nuts in the bread. Luckily, my husband had only eaten some whipped cream from the plate at this point. As the waitress walks by, I flag her down and ask if there are nuts in the dish. She says no, as if she knew for sure. I insist- so she checks, and indeed there are nuts in the bread pudding. She asks my husband if he wants something else, which he declines. We pay our bill and I make him tip her even though our evening could have been spent in the emergency room or worse thanks to her cavalier attitude. (which frankly I'm now regretting since I don't think she still realizes how serious this could have been) I tell the manager on the way out, he notes that the waitress asked him if the dessert contained nuts but it must have been after the fact. Like that makes this somehow better...He offers my husband a Benadryl, and gives a half of an apology. I would expect such a place would have understood and taken food allergies much more seriously. I'm just glad there were actual nuts in the dish as opposed to nut flour or extract which I wouldn't have been able to detect since our waitress clearly did no checking before she served us food.
*note-we paid for the dessert, the waitress and the manager made no suggestion about comping it",2

Stopped in or rather decided to ride 20 miles to enjoy one of my favs. I had the country burrito and a donut. Now time to head back home and enjoy the scenery. Peace

Tried the wing ding dang burrito. It was good but what would you expect. My is still the country. I thinks it's the maple that has me hooked.",2
73,1,1548633600000,"I've ordered delivery from this place, and I've also been inside the restaurant a few times and have met with the owner. They get 5 stars right off the bat for the simple fact that they deliver Mexican food to my house. That's a rarity in this town in and of itself, but the fact that the food was good was a bonus. 

People get really picky about their Mexican food here - as they should. Arizona is lousy with Mexican food restaurants. I'm not going to go so far as to say it's the best I've ever had (I've had a lot of Mexican food from a lot of different places), but I will say that it's delicious and consistent. I mean, some of the best places to go get authentic Mexican food in the Valley are dirty little hole in the wall joints that you might be scared to go into. This place is clean and nice and quite a bit more upscale than that. 

I wouldn't say the food here is inauthentic either. It's plenty authentic... that word means different things to different people anyway. Some think it means a similar experience to when they visited Rocky Point, and others will cite examples from when they visited Oaxaca or Cabo or Mazatlan, and yet others will compare your favorite place to a chain they like. Who knows. Good food is good food. 

My experiences with the staff, management, and owner have been outstanding as well, and I will probably be eating here a lot.",2

82,2,1548547200000,"I came here for a few months because it's close to work and I was offered the tour which took about 10 minutes. I would totally recommend the tour because you get to see all the features of the gym. 

I have to say, prices ain't cheap here. Corporate plans are around $75 a month and individual plans are something like $120? Don't quote me on that, I can't recall exact pricing but something in the hungreds. 

Here are the pros and cons

PROS
- quiet
- not a lot of people especially in the afternoon and evenings so no lineups
- clean and not smelly
- wet and dry sauna, whirlpool, pool
- tennis (extra)
- good selection of machines
- towel service, toiletries, hair dryers, magazines
- cafe in gym serving smoothies, drinks and hot food (pretty good!)
- convenient, TTC accessible

CONS
- pricey
- limited group exercise classes, not as frequent as other gyms

There you have it. If you're looking for a gym and the pros attract you, get a tour. The membership coordinators are all super friendly.",2
82,3,1547856000000,"What an ingenious service! As someone who likes to save a little money when I can but hates the hassle of trying to locate on Craigslist or raiding the local liquor store for free boxes, renting boxes was the perfect solution.  I scheduled a delivery just days before I needed it and Jimmy was prompt in delivering boxes to me during my first requested time slot.  The boxes were all in great shape  and the perfect sizes, and no doubt made my move much smoother. Pick-up was very easy, with Jimmy once again picking them up during my first requested time slot.  I loved that I was able to do my part in reducing wasted materials while absolutely saving money.  Would highly recommend this to anyone and will be using again in the future",1

I thought something was a little fishy at my 1st appointment there was a ""price list"" on the bathroom wall with the same prices that I had paid for my Groupon, which was supposed to be 50%+ off the regular prices. The aesthetician told me I should call Groupon and get a refund then just buy a new package at their office (turns out I SHOULD have taken her advice!!) that seemed very odd to me since I had already paid for 3 seperate packages of 6 treatments... Never the less, I had to reschedule my November appoimentment and they couldn't get me back in until JANUARY!? I received a voicemail from MSC the night before my scheduled appointment telling me that my Groupon had expired and they will not be seeing me the following day! I called back immediately and got a message saying they were closed, I left them a message and read them the terms of the Groupon I had purchased and told them to call me back. I showed up for that appoimentment and they refused to honor my Groupon even thought it was good for 1 follow up treatment within 1 year of the last treatment. The receptionist was very rude and condesending. I will NEVER be going back to this office again. Do not trust this place to honor their part of the deal once they receive your money!",1

Love that they change up the flavors every now and then. The seasonal oatmeal raisin and pumpkin flavors are amazing. They let you control all your toppings (NOT like that other place).

Overcooked steak: I asked for medium. I got almost well done. This was disappointing. Even left a few pieces behind....  
French onion soup dumplings: Served at room temp (barely warm), so the cheese wasn't  ooey or gooey. 
Short rib Mac and Cheese: the mac and cheese tasted good but there were tiniest morsels of short rib that you could barely see or taste. 

Ambience--not nearly as glamorous or stunning as the one LES. Not even close.  Also, the free champagne bar is outside of the restaurant, which is kind of weird, logistically speaking. Even weirder than a bar in a bathroom!     

Drinks--Cocktail list is almost identical to the one in the LES. Drinks here are pricey and strong. Sadly, I couldn't finish my second drink, but since we are in Vegas they poured it into a ""to go"" cup for me. 
 
Service-- the bartender was efficient and the server was extra bubbly. It's unfortunate the food was so bad.  

Final verdict: I came here hoping I would have the same great experience as the The B&E in NY but the Lower East Side location is better than the Vegas location in all aspects.",2

When I spoke to the representative, she told me that she didn't have my appointment in the system and instead of taking responsibility, she blamed it on a computer glitch. I asked her to cancel the work order as I will not be giving such an unprofessional company any money.",2

Walking into the store it always smells super sweet and delicious, plus the staff is always friendly. Thanks again!",2
227,2,1546300800000,"This place feels more like a factory than a store really. When you walk in, almost everyone are busy working, mixing, steaming in the kitchen behind the counter. They typically ignore you unless you start the conversation or picked up some of their items and stood in front of the counter for awhile with hopeful look on your face that someone will eventually talk to you. Service and atmosphere in the store are not something that will make you want to stay there any longer.

HOWEVER, they make AWESOME fresh Bak Tong Goh (literally translated white sugar cake) as mentioned in the review below. That's not the only reason why I would go there, they also sell fresh tofu pudding (tofu hua or taufu fa) in a tub (500g?), which is something I regularly get whenever I'm in the area. Do request for the syrup, or you can add maple syrup/honey on top of it when you get home.  In the summer, I like a get a tub of cold tofu pudding and eat it in the park with my friend.

The only thing to take note is that they do overcharge you. One tub of tofu pudding is $2, with syrup (a small container) it's $2.50. It's still consider as really cheap, but 25% increase in price just for a small container of syrup.. ? 

I have yet to try a lot of their products, which I will eventually cos they do look really yummy. A lot of Asian Supermarket actually do carry a lot of their products which would usually be in the bakery section. Don't discount them just because of the appearance of the store or the staffs, in my world, nothing beat FRESH.",2

What I really think is neat is the coffee shop and the wine bar share the same space so everyone is happy... the coffee drinkers and the beer/ wine crowd. 
I happened to be both.  We were treated to an inspiring conversation by the owner Oliver Stone who has a miracle life changing story to share.  He also recommended a wine (Purple Heart) which I had never tried but loved. My friend had a latte and a pumpkin scone which was delicious. (Yes, I know she ordered it but I ate it!)

Our snacks were some deviled eggs that I'd read were delish & they were. So we're 3 for 3. Good staff, app & drink. We will be back for brunch. The pancakes sound amazing. I mentioned to the bartender that wanted to try the popcorn & asked him if he liked it himself. Like how spicey is it etc. He said it's a perfect mix you really should try it on your next visit.

The food is generally pretty good. I like that they have veg options so I don't have to majorly modify anything just to order. Today I had the power greens salad. It was really good. The dressing was really salty, but I like salty so I loved it. My meat eating friend ordered the veggie burger and said it was delicious. I had some of her fries and they were so-so...tasted like run of the mill, from a bag, previously frozen fries.

We got the free wine when we checked in. It was ok...not great but also not awful.

So here's my issue w this place...the staff is just rude. Last time I was there we came at night and missed the ""wait to be seated"" sign. We sat ourselves on the balcony. The waiter came over, told us the table wasn't clean/ready, and then told us they saved that particular table because of the view. Basically we weren't good enough to sit there. We left. 

This time the bartender offered us a high top or the bar and then basically told us we couldn't have a table because they were saved for parties of 3 or more. Our party of 2 sat at the bar. Later we saw 2 guys get seated at a 4 top table. Whoopsie

Frankly, I am not often impressed with the steaks at Morton's, Ruth's Chris, or places like BLT as I am able to grill more delicious steaks at home when I buy prime grade cuts.
The atmosphere and service were wonderful, and it was convenient to have a nice place like this at the hotel where we were staying.

I ordered the Gin Blossom, which seemed promising, but was made by amateur bartenders painstakingly following a recipe, heavy on the peach schnapps. $10 for a glass I left on the table 3/4 full.

The dealers were great, very friendly and helpful. I was still pretty new to the game of craps when we went but they had no problem showing me the game, helping me out, and joking around. Really quick drink service too. 
The 5 o'clock somewhere bar was great. They have a ""reverse happy hour"" which was really cool. We had trouble adjusting to the time zone change (we're from the east coast) so we'd wake up every morning at 4 or 5am! We'd just head down to the bar, get some $5 margaritas during happy hour, and play some craps before the table got too busy. It was great! 
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the lack of the type of table games I like. It looked like they had plenty of blackjack tables, but only 1 roulette table and 1 craps table. There were a few times when I wanted to play but couldn't because the ONE table was full. 
Still, it was a great time. We'll be back to Vegas in May 2013 for our honeymoon and plan to stay at the Flamingo so we can spend more time at the Margaritaville casino and 5 o'clock somewhere bar!  :)",3

She checked for us (about 1 hour after ordering) and only said that our ticket was next.

After receiving our food, I found a hair on the bowl that had my side of fruit in it. I asked for the sever if it could be replaced and he didn't exactly listen as he came back moments later with the same bowl (hair still visible) but with new fruit instead.

The meat was thin, dry and overdone, and the toppings did little to help that - hardly worthy of restaurant prices. Others in my party had a similar experience with the salmon.

I was really worried as to how it was going to taste. The flavoring comes in syringes and I thought it was going to be crazy sweet but it wasn't at all. 

There's different toppings you can add in, you can take as many as you want- keep in mind their $0.50 each. For milk teas they have a soy milk option but I would have been so darn impressed if they had a 2% lactose milk option. I would have definitely gotten a milk tea instead had this been the case. 

My drink tasted super fresh and was really flavorful. I would say it was the best bubble tea I've had. Picking the flavorings is a bit of a gamble though because your literally picking flavors you've never tasted before and hoping their gonna go together and taste good.

And since I usually pick wherever has the least TVs within view to sit, be it bar, hightop, booth, or table, walking into this maze of LCD flusters me and I stand there wide-eyed trying to settle on somewhere while the hostess's holding the menus and eyeballing me. I mean I've only been twice but it's happened both times. Like a deer in the ESPNlights. Baaa.

So ya - if you want to watch the game and scarf a seriously gut-busting burger, have ats. Beer selection is goodish, tho they seem to be struggling having their entire list ready to tap. Staff seems capable and somewhat nerdy, plus plus. Mixed sweet/regular tots, yay. Onion tangles, meh. Don't get the cheese fries if you don't like cheez whiz. 

Do get the hungover cyclist if you're into spectacleburger - even if you aren't the food porn type you're gonna wanna take a picture. The most bizarre I've had thus far would have to be the cross country - complete mess flavor n texture-wise, but totally enjoyable.

506,2,1546819200000,"Everything I read about Holler & Dash being Cracker Barrel's attempt at appealing to millenials was 100% true. From the menu being filled with words like ""pepper jam"", ""goat cheese"" and (of course) avocado to its clever, creative names like ""hollerback"" sauce and ""Everyday I'm brusslin'"", this is an effort to appeal to millenials. 

The atmosphere was more of the same and was probably my favorite part of the experience.

For the food: everthing we had was ok, nothing was really impressive. I definitely appreciate what they were trying for but it seemed to fall a bit short. Several menu items seemed like they were trying to throw in buzzwords that the millenials would like to hear and things seemed to have a lot going on. The biscuits were on the dry side and $10.50 for a biscuit + a side left me pretty hungry.

First off the bread. Cold! Butter, ice cold. The small round french-type bread that was so chewy my jaw was sore. The second bread was a pretzel like bread shaped like a baguette, it was ok. 

I ordered the chicken and it was served with mashed potatoes and a little bit of green beans. It was good, but nothing to write home about. I tasted the chili rubbed skirt steak and it was also good, but still not blowing me away.  

Service was pretty slow. The brownie dessert was nothing special, but it was complimentary since we were celebrating a birthday.

Then 15 mins go by before she is available to take our food.  We ordered appetizers and dinner.  It was 25 mins before the wings came and then the kicker was the wings were barely warm.  We were so hungry we inhaled them.  The medium was quite warm and the terriyaki was ok.  Our food took another 20 (Yes, 10pm) our dinners came.  The Margherita pizza and the M.J.

When she picked up the car she was charged almost $190.

I called the next day and spoke with the service writer who says my girlfriend did request a full diagnostic service and implied that's what she was charged for. Then she put on someone named Kathy who my girlfriend had spoken to before bringing the car in who then proceeded to tell me that $190 is the standard price for the freon top off!

We naively thought the buffet line would be reasonable during the weekend. Oops... 0_0

These poor folks are the closest restaurant that will do during lunch or early dinner (as I call ""linner""). 

They're scrutinized big time since we cannot enter the Bacchanal. Because of that I chose to review them much later. 

Now w/all that being said, I think it's par to give them 3 stars.

I agree w/most concerning the prices. There's nothing special about their food except for their convenience. 

The food was edible but if you're starving, anything dead will do. My beef chow foon (same as drunken noodle) tasted as it should and his kung pao chicken was flavored properly. We looked at each other and said ""3 stars"". 

Memorable bites were from the green onion pancakes but I'm partial to fried carbs.

Last night I arrived to Casbah around 9:15. The kitchen closes at 10:00 so we were fine. The male at the host stand seemed pretty irritated that we were just arriving but it wasn't like I was walking in at 9:55. We opted to sit inside because it was a little chilly. He the two of us down at a table against the wall in the very back. It was tiny and cramped and not too mention very poor lighting. Almost felt like I was punished to that table? So I asked our server to be moved to another table in the restaurant. 

We served some bread and sea salt butter. In my opinion, the bread was nothing special. I had a few bites and didn't finish much just because I wanted to save room for the more important dishes. We were also served some type of Greek yogurt for the bread but that combination didn't sound appetizing to me. 

I ordered a 3 cheese selection option as an appetizer. I regret it a little bit now just because I was served the same bread. I added the prosciutto for an extra $4 and it was very good. I picked the first 3 cheeses on the menu (forget exactly what they were). I would have like the server to tell me which cheese was which, but I enjoyed them nonetheless. 

In addition I also had the Charred Spanish rock octopus which was the highlight of the entire meal. I highly recommend it. 

I had the Casbah (signature, as I was told) double-cut pork chop. This cut was very large and I ended up taking most of it to go. The rice was phenomenal, especially the rice that was under the meat. It had absorbed the flavors from the meat. 

Finally, I decided on the pistachio cannoli. I had a tough time deciding between that and the chocolate pot de creme. The flavor seemed to be a little off and I think i would have like the filling to be a bit sweeter.  I also opted for the Greek dessert wine pairing, which they only able to serve me half a glass because they ran out. It ended up being free, so I didn't mind. 

My server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to explain things very clearly. However, I HATE when servers go take a smoke break and then leave my table smelling like an ashtray. Off putting as I was eating my cannoli dessert.

549,2,1548547200000,"I had previously got my 2013 mustang from Peoria ford last year and had recently traded in for a brand new 2017. I had called ahead asking if they had a ecoboost mustang with the performance pack. I was told they did have quite a few on the lot but by the time I got down there after driving 50 miles there and driving around in the car with my sales rep for an hour looking for it.  I find out they have none. So We settle on a base 2017 Ecoboost Everything was going smooth we had worked out a deal or at least I thought. I was told when talking in finance everything was going to be fine he didn't see an issue with my deal except I might need another 1000$ down. Now by the time I got home and inspected the car after having it detailed. Since I didn't really have a chance since the car behind me was trying to leave, I noticed that the gas cap was missing paint like it was scratched off. Come to find out they said they didn't do that and they couldn't help me but referred me to the paint shop they use. A few days later I had received a call saying that they would need 2000$ down and everything was approved if I could bring that in. I set up a time Friday morning to come down and just a day or so before they told me they needed 4000$. There excuse was that they were selling the car to cheap. After saying I am going to bring the car back because there was no way I would have that by Friday,  I was called back saying that 2000 was fine now after making arrangements to bring my car back. In which I still came in and gave my 2000$ extra. Come to find out, the car I traded in 3 weeks ago. I still had a payment come out of my account for a car I no longer have because they didn't pay it off yet. Once I called I was told they were paying it off this week and I had to take it up with either the bank or my finance company.  I've always had a good experience with Peoria ford but this specific time wasn't the best which is unfortunate I've always recommended people to them but it seems getting this car all they tried to do was get as much money out of me as possible. Fast forward to a month later and going on 2 weeks ago I placed an order for parts for my car. I was told if it was in stock it would take 3 days and if not it would take 5 for them to be shipped.  4 days after I placed my order they didn't even order my parts. Now Come to find out they're saying hopefully it should be here sometime next week. Would have been nice to know it was going to take 2-3 weeks before I decided to go through a dealership that's an hour away from me anyways. Now I know to buy my own parts because I'll get them much sooner ordering directly from roush or a different roush dealer. On top of that every time I would talk to someone I was told I would be called back with some info regarding my order. I never was. I had to call on multiple occasions just to find anything out. One thing I have to say that I love about Peoria ford. If they can't get you approved nobody can. That's actually why I've got my last two cars here. I wouldn't make an hour trip when I have multiple dealerships closer to me. UPDATE. 1 month still no parts in decided to cancel my order and go elsewhere.",2

There's live music sometimes and the location is great. I like that it has its own parking lot. Parking could get annoying in Scottsdale. 

The cons: 
If you're into wine, red or white. There are only 2 options. The red is a grenache blend. Not sure about the white. The pretzel was bland and somewhat hard. The cheese dip was okay. The prices are comparable to most other restaurants and I'm not sure the quality is comparable.  

I was excited when this place opened because I thought, great something like Lux in CenPho, a coffee house that serves wine. Lux is def bigger. I guess it is nice sometimes to get away from the crowd and be somewhere not so packed. Def a good place to hang out or meet for a quick ""get to know you"" date.

The fries themselves weren't cooked as much as I thought they should've been, and there wasn't too much sauce other than what the ribs provided.

630,2,1546732800000,"Heed the advice of the reviewers for this clinic. I thought it was just a fluke of a bad experience or just a busy day for the office for some people, but the service is terrible at heart.

I went here as a new patient on 12/21/17 and this is one of those get in and get out type of doctors office. The office staff SHOULD find another job since patient care and experience seems to be their least of their concern, and more concerned about their emotion well being. Front staff ignores people, office is unorganized and in disarray with people standing while trying to figure out which of the 2 windows to go to. What makes it worse is the genius sign in sheet location is taped in front of a window where people are getting helped at. As it was my first time there, the girl who handled my papers mentioned a rude remark when I didn't give her my ID when she clearly said that she needs my insurance card and nothing else.

As for the inside the doctors office, expect to your say what your problem is in 1 sentence and don't get any concerned feedback or questions returned. The nurses are there to guide you like a cow at a farm, pre check up, and leave you in a room. The doctor named Knirk, (i think) was okay. She is nice and performed all the necessary physical exams, left a ""short"" session question for concerns unlike the nurses, and covered most of the grounds that I had concerns with in her initial examination and my history.
 
Outside the doctors office via phone calls, is where another frustration starts with the office staff. Got a question? Be prepared to get hung up on, sent to the answering machine, or ignored before even introducing yourself. What ticks me off is they actually answer then send you to a brick wall. They clearly would ignore you after hearing a voice they don't want to deal with.

Would give this place a 0/0 but I give it a 0.5/5 stars only because of the decent doctor in there. There is no point for a doctor who has near useless and rude office staff.",2

I ordered Fish n'chips (beer battered halibut fillet served with fries, homemade coleslaw and creamy tartar sauce).  It was okay, not great. Considering it was $14, there could have been more fish (it was mostly batter).

Gord ordered Rogue chicken wings (1 lb of herb marinated chicken wings tossed in your choice of mild, medium, hot, suicide, bbq, honey garlic or sweet chili sauce - he got sweet chili sauce) and onion rings.

The bartender had told me that the wings were breaded so I didn't order any (I'm not a fan of battered wings). I wish I had because Gord's wings were better than my fish. It's like they were Shake 'n Baked then deep fried.The onion rings were really good.

I've had Mexican Food in the best restaurants in Mexico City, & hands down Padre's lives up to it's reputation of being one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. The food is spicy but not so hot that you have to drink gallons of libations just to put the fire out...

I will definitely go back!",2

667,2,1547510400000,"So this place is definitely everything I've heard. I can certainly see why it has all these high ratings. I want to give it a 5 but unfortunately my signature biscuit today was a 4. It certainly wasn't bad at all. It just didn't meet my expectations based on the ingredients and what I saw on the menu.

Speaking of the menu, it's great! I love simple menus. Even more so, I love simple menus with a lot options and creative and eclectic food choices.
Right off the bat when walked in I saw several similarities to Rise biscuits and bakery but I was immediately way more excited about their menu.

Their specialty is biscuits so the obviously have a lot of buscuit options. When it comes to biscuit options I would say they have three different types. 1. The simple type: A biscuit with jam, jelly, etc. 2. The breakfast type: A buscuit with eggs, cheese and your choice of meat and 3. The signature type: This is where it gets exciting and interesting. These options have better meat choices like fried chicken, pork tenderloin, fancier cheeses, etc. as well as some unique accompaniments. 

I got the kickback chicken which has Fried chicken, goat cheese, green onion, and sweet pepper jelly. It was preety good but not as mind-blowing as it sounds on paper hence the aforementioned 4 rating. I am excited to go back and try the pork tenderloin biscuit however. It's called the pork Rambler and it has Fried pork tenderloin, blackberry butter, and fried onion. straws. They also have great sides and I got the charred corn, mozzarella and lime salad however the biscuit sandwiches are so huge that I didn't even need it.

All in all, a lot of great menu options so I'm excited to go back and try them again for brunch. Maybe next time they'll get a 5!",2

There was no one at the front when we came in and the bartender didn't even look up.  Had to wait to be seated.  

There were only a few people in the restaurant and now I know why.  The chips were oily and cold.  The salsa was bland.  

I ordered the chicken tacos and the meat tasted weird and it had not been salted before cooking.  Very bland and grease came off the taco when I picked it up (and it was in a soft corn tortilla, not fried).  The refried beans were gluey and had NO FLAVOR.  The spanish rice was ok.

The grilled cheese my daughter go was ridiculous.  Velvetta between 2 pieces of Texas toast.  And served with cold fries.

No refills on my drink without having to ask, but my husbands' glass was constantly kept full.

In short, high price, low payout.

Will not be returning.",3

It's a must to ask about the daily specials for dinner and dessert. They always have something homemade to choose from. Here, it's simply fresh, authentic Italian cuisine. You can't ask for more than that in today's resto scene. BUT you must ask to have your pizza pie cut (and make it very clear to your waiter) or you will be cutting it yourself.  When you eat here, you feel fresh afterwards- not heavy.

Idea: they really need to go with the Dyson Airblade. The washrooms are quite slick, yet they installed the most oldschool, ugly hand dryers. It just doesn't fit lol",2

697,2,1547942400000,"Love that this place is child friendly and has little portions for the smaller children. 
This is a great option for a lazy dinner night that is Great for the whole family!
I personally enjoy the chips, salsa and queso for an appetizer.  Typically I have always had fresh chips that are warm and with the case so it feels like it melts in your mouth. Super delicious! The queso has some peppers in it but it's not overly powerful or spicy. You could certainly tweak it to make it more spicy with the salsa provided. I prefer to have it the way it is since my children often enjoy it too.
Besides the casual atmosphere and to go option, this place is perfect for children because they offer mini quesadillas AT NO COST for the little ones. This includes an orange slice. If your children are like mine and eat like a bird then this may be more than enough for them to eat as the herb meal, however it's also a great appetizer for the kids that I think is a great addition to their meal. The fact that an orange slice is included makes me happy because it is adding another very important food group to the meal or snack; instead of just a greasy quesadilla. I will add that the quesadilla is not at all greasy but pretty delicious!!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
Not just for families but great for people who work nearby and looking for a tasty lunch/dinner.",2

The price for the clean but average place is a bit high. The reason I am giving it 4 star is 1- because the food was good although a bit expensive 2- They are in my hood and I really want a sushi place in walking distance so they better make it. we had basics like shrimp tempura, shushi , sashimi and maki. They were all fresh and in good size and shape. I believe they should adjust the price and people will come in for their few times a week sushi fixture.",2

There is nothing ""precious"" about Skillets-- it looks like a chain and has a typical breakfast/lunch menu that you'd find anywhere else.  Their biscuits were worth the price of admission. I could list a whole bunch of complaints about this place, but in the end their food filled me up and was well cooked, if just a little ""boring"" tasting.  All things considered, I would go there again.

Service was quick and very friendly (to the point of overwhelming).  I had my carry out order in just a few minutes.  Very nice people, they offered me coffee even though I was carrying out an order.",2

714,1,1547078400000,"After seeing the advertisement on a cab driving past us, we decided to look into this show. We are glad we did.  (Especially since Yelp had a 50% off ticket special!)  

We bought the VIP tickets to ensure good seats.  While I'm sure sitting anywhere I the small theatre would have been fine too.  The theatre seats about 150 people. Before the show a waitress will come to take any drink orders.  Looked like cash only though.

The show was fantastic. The host of the show was great.  He kept us laughing.  The ""skits"" were entertaining. Although the best was the guy from America's Got Talent, ""Turf"". He was amazing!  Too bad they don't have him more involved in the show! 

At one point they handed out Jello shots to the audience.  Nice touch.  

Lots of audience participation in this show. It didn't matter where you sat. 

After the show a few of the actors were outside for photo opportunities.  (Before you go in they take your picture in front of the Zombie Burlesque sign. Available after the show for purchase.)

We would definitely recommend this show to others.  And possibly go and see it again next time we are in Vegas!",2

The noodles were fine as were the brisket slices. The slices of tai arrived well done already and were on the tough side.

Standard bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos, and lime as garnishes.

738,3,1548547200000,"Our second night in Vegas was a much anticipated reservation at Bouchon. We arrived at scheduled reservation and were seated immediately.

The service was not what we'd expected of a fine dining establishment associated with Chef Thomas Keller.

The waiter was appropriate in greeting us and defining menu, he was appropriate in taking our order. Problem, we never saw him again.

The meal was delivered by restaurant staff. We had to communicate thru restaurant staff for the Wine Master service(sommelier title  unknown ), he was appropriate with paring and serving wine, still no waiter.

There was a gentlemen across the dining room, we made eye contact, he approached the table, he knew we were unhappy. I asked what happened to the waiter, he pointed across the dining room indicating he was busy with another table. We were speechless with this response.

There was no reason to debate at this time. We asked for the check, he indicated he could help us with that. Still no waiter....

The lack of training we observed from our experience at Bouchon was not acceptable.

Upon exiting the restaurant we were approached by a female employee""she wanted to make it right"". A little to late, the core staff is weak at this establishment.

I will be sending a note to the corporate office of Chef Keller informing him of this situation.

Cost wise, it wasn't bad.  But i came out alone, while hungry and greedy, so I ordered beer, appetizer and a meal for just myself.  I could've easily shared it with another person.  The total was $32. 

Appetizer sampler.  OMG. Picked three and got a potato thing (forgot the name) came out like a quesadilla (potato fried in a tortilla)... it was good but a bit bland, definitely load it with one of the delicious chutneys!!  And the beef dumplings... so much like a ravioli, but NOT like ravioli... and the chicken soomosa.  HOLY COW!  It's like an empanada crossed with a Chinese dumpling, but it's its own amazing thing!  Definitely worth it! 

For my main dish I chose the Afghani meatballs.  Amazing!!!! Peppery spicy without being over bearing in an amazing gravy.  I put it over the plain white rice. Sooooooo good! 

The Naan was DELISH! 

The service was amazing.  The waitress was kind and patient and helped me order.  She was attentive without being overwhelming and pleasure to have help me. 

I can't wait for my next trip out here (will be about 3 months) so I can come back.  I will definitely be thinking of his place while I'm home in SoCal.",2
750,3,1548892800000,"Went here on a Saturday night and the place had a really good vibe. 

First, this place is really big. It has bars everywhere, along with a dance floor and probably the best live band I've heard in awhile (Dancing Naked). The shared lead was this beautiful woman named Elise (sp?) whose voice was so amazing that it mesmerized! She was only filling in, but fortunately we found out she was in a Motown show at PH (V Theater) so we're headed over there to see her next!

As for THIS place, though, I couldn't find a single thing wrong with it. We had great seats, everyone, EVERYONE was having a great time. The drinks were delicious, they have high end liquor and make dazzling drinks and the waitstaff was incredibly quick, they had fabulous attitudes and made you feel like you were their best friends!

Cocktails: I had the traditional Mesa margarita on the rocks, it was a bit tart but very well made and delicious. My husband decided to get the mint julep. Strong but a gem! 

Appetizers: Goat Cheese Queso! You die and go to cheese, poblano heaven. 

Bread basket: even the bread basket was outstanding. Southwestern flavors at their best, showcased in the best form possible, bread. 

Entree 1: the New York strip steak, medium rare. One of the best seasoned, flavorful cuts of meat I've had. 

Entree 2: my husband had the 16 spice chicken, I couldn't believe how Bobby accomplished to incorporate 16 spices yet have them develop in a lovely way without being overbearing. This came with our favorite, the cilantro pesto mashed potatoes. 

Sides: my steak did not have a side, this is where the cilantro pesto mashed potatoes complimented it very well. 

The roasted corn: I didn't realize this was seasonal, but every time I have this I'm actually upset that I don't have 3 stomachs to be able to finish and eat way too much of it.

Server: she was so sweet and made our dinner a lovely experience

Bottom line, I love this restaurant way too much. It is consistent and well priced, relaxed but still formal. Perfect dinner experience.",2

They also have an interesting and exciting mix of hand crafted cocktails. It has a comfortable modern setting with a nice long bar and expansive patio that faces Central. 

We stopped in for happy hour the other day and were pleasantly surprised with the prices and variety of cocktails and eats. We started with the beets, they came with cucumber, pickeled ginger, bean curd and a lemongrass vinaigrette. It was beautifully plated, but the amount of soy was so overwhelming it was difficult to eat(and the beets weren't completely ripe). For the noodle bowl we tried the roasted pork, it came with bacon, mustard greens, bean sprouts, shitake mushrooms and a soft egg. It was delicious. I had to try the steamed buns and went for the squid sausage that the bartender recommended. It was amazing and I loved the aioli it was dressed in.

920,3,1547596800000,"I had read a little about this place and was pretty curious to check it out. We are pretty much novices to this style of asian cuisine but here is what we go and our impressions:

Pork Belly Sliders - well when I think of sliders I expect them to be really small. The portion was pretty big the issue was we just did not like the spices used to flavor it. It may be just something that you have to like to appreciate - for instance, I really just am not a fan of cilantro and there was a good bit of it on there as well as other spices we did not care for. 

Wonton dry Noodles - Like others have mentioned - I was expecting a lot more noodle options - perhaps they will be expanding the option but you stick the word noodles in the name of your place and I expect to see more than four options. That said, this was the best thing we ate. The noodles were lovely and I loved the wonton dumplings. I was actually thinking about them the next day and really cannot wait to go back and get more!

Scallion pancakes - I have had these at a number of places and really love them. These were not my favorite. In fact, I prefer the ones across the street at rose tree cafe. My husband, however, really enjoyed them. 

Would I go back? totally and plan to!",1

The samosas were good, filled with potatoes and peas and tasted very fresh. 

The tandoori platter was filled with meat and salad. The salad was old brown iceberg lettuce, with big chunks of raw onion, not impressed with that! 

The chicken Bryianni is my fav and it's amazing! Get it every time! Medium heat is enough for me. 

Service wasn't great, was waiting for water for a long time. Decor doesn't make sense and is not very welcoming. 

Overall, good food, bad service!",2
930,1,1547683200000,"A bubble tea place with a unique concept and theme. The Labothery is a DIY bubble tea store with a science lab theme. The flavored syrups coming in syringes, the powders in vials, and the sinkers in petri dishes. Pick all of those out, and employees dressed in lab coats will assemble your drink for you.

The employees can help you if it's your first time. When you arrive, the first step is to grab a metal tray. Then, you can pick from powder or syrups for your drink flavor. If you pick out a syrup, then you don't need to pick out any additional sweeteners. The employees suggest that you pick out two flavors. However, be aware that each syringe adds $1 to your total drink price. Next, you pick out a sinker from a display case. They offer a lot of different options: regular boba, crystal boba, popping boba, jelly, aloe vera, and red bean. You can add more than one sinker to your drink, but each costs 50¢. Once that's done you tell the cashier whether you want the drink as a slushie or tea, and if you choose tea, then you pick from black, green, and oolong. Finally, you can sit back and watch your drink get assembled. 

I got a lychee and peach syrup green tea with aloe vera, while my boyfriend got a mango and kumquat oolong tea with green apple jelly. Since my boyfriend doesn't like overly sweet drinks, we asked if we could get it half sweet, and the cashier was happy to note that on our drinks.

Both of our drinks came out perfect, and we really enjoyed it. However, I can see how things can go badly if you're not smart with your choices, so that might be the reason for some of these negative reviews. If you're in the Toronto area, then I would definitely recommend giving this place a try for the experience.",2

Service was good.  We built our own pasta dish, which was a nice option.  Their meatballs are enormous.  Nice seasoning, good sauce.  We also had an order of calamari, and they still cook that perfectly.  It's always tender, never chewy.

984,3,1546560000000,"Since I was in middle school, I patronized the 24 Fitness at West Sahara and Cimarron.  I loved that gym: large, well maintained, friendly staff and people.  So when the announcement came that it was closing down in July of last year, I took the news with a loud, resounding and somewhat manly ""NOOOOOOO!!!!""  Not quite like Darth Vader's at the end of episode III, but still booming.  BUT!  They were remodeling this location and all who had gone to the West Sahara gym could now go to this one at no additional cost.  Despite being further away from my house, I went anyway to check it out.

First impression, ""Holy crap this place is hoooge!  And has plushy lounge chairs!""  Granted, I am the type of guy who could lift weights in a shack and be happy, but it was a nice touch for people either chilling after a workout or waiting for your more motivated spouse/partner/relative/friend to finish their workout.  Second thing I noticed walking to the locker room: towels!  Wow, they must be spoiling us now!  Large cycling room with painted skies and mountains where it feels more outdoorsy than other cycle rooms with look more like raves.  Basketball court is small, with only two hoops rather than the usual six, but since I am 5'6"" and don't quite have the jumping ability of Spud Webb yet, I don't really use the court.

Locker Rooms:  CARPET!  Excuse the caps lock, but this is the first time I have ever been to a gym where the floor was not either concrete or tile.  Lockers a big and wide, with a ledge in front so you have a lot of room to put your stuff down while you change (unlike other 24's I have gone too with cramped lockers and barely any benches).  Showers with foggy doors so you have pretty good privacy, and a very large aquatic area.  

Climbing the stairs to the workout floor, you have tons of workout space.  Cardio machines are in the area closed to the stairs, with weights on the other side of the floor.  Machines and benches are well spaced out and there are a ton of machines, so even when the gym is busy it never feels cramped or crowded.  Cardio machines are high tech, either having a personal TV so you can watch whatever you want, or sockets for you iPod or other personal electronics.  Lots of weights as well, though I personally prefer free weights over machines.

There is also a ""Personal Training Area"" where trainers work with their clients, but is open to everyone.  It's basically a plyometric and functional fitness area, with rope, medicine balls, kettle balls and stools for jumping.  So if you're looking into a more explosive type of training, this is a good area to do that, and you might even witness yours truly tripping and faceplanting from a mistimed jump, as what happens once every couple weeks.  

Only complaint I have about the floor, and it is a rather large annoyance for me unfortunately, is that the dumbbells are almost never in the right rack for the right weight.  In other words, I once found a set of 125 lb dumbbells on the rack for 40's, and so on and so on.  It sounds like at first that this only happens for a couple of pairs of weights, but it is quite a problem here, and the weights are often disorganized.  This escalates because when someone is done with their weights, and go to put the weights away and find other weights where his are supposed to go, they will often put it somewhere else, creating a chain reaction.  I try my best to organize to the best of my ability,  but sometimes I am forced to put the weights anywhere since I either can't get to the right rack, or the weights there are too heavy for me.  

In conclusion, I was on the fence between giving this place a 4 or 5, making my ""official"" score a 4.5.  I went with five, because this place is practically perfect except for the organization problem with the free weights.  This is a an excellent gym, however, and is the best 24 I have ever been to.

PROS
Large and new workout floor
Towels available for use
Clean and roomy locker room
Large and advanced aquatic area.
Personal Training Area for plyometrics
Friendly and courteous staff.

CONS
Small basketball court
Disorganized dumbbells in the free weights area.

985,3,1548720000000,"Stopped in for a steak dinner and i assumed it would be great because of the price $45 (for just the steak no sides) first and this is Bobby Flays restaurant. Well i was wrong i would have rather ate at Fat Burger and saved my money. 

I ordered the New York and it was ok nothing special i also ordered the $8 sides the corn which was great and the twice baked potato that was terrible i didn't even finish it there was horseradish mixed in it and some orange sauce across the top which really threw me off. 

My man ordered the pork loin and it sucked the sauces that they put on the meat is all you can taste and it made it nasty the same thing with the filet mignon. The cioppino was in a green cilantro sauce and all you get is a little bowl.

992,3,1548115200000,"I used Priceline to book our trip to Vegas this past weekend and got the Trump Hotel for $93/night. At first I was disappointed, but since we like to try different hotels in Vegas, we saw this as a cool opportunity. Thank goodness we went in with a good attitude!

The area between the highway and the hotel is....interesting to say the least. Who knew Vegas had an erotic museum?? As previous reviews have stated, it's valet parking only. I don't mind that, but trying to get the car on Monday morning when we were leaving was a bit frustrating. We tried calling down when we were getting ready to leave to have the car pulled around so that it would be waiting for us, but when we called, we were told they couldn't bring it around until we were downstairs. Seriously?? The explanation given to my husband was that we had to physically hand the valet ticket in before they would go get the car. I thought it was a really lame excuse, but luckily it took only about 10 minutes for us to get our car.

Check-in was very quick and friendly. Yes, there is a $15 per day resort fee, but it pays for the parking, use of the pool, and use of the fitness center. The rooms are spacious, but not as impressive as those at the Palazzo. The bathroom is actually the best part about the room - very large shower and a nice jacuzzi tub. There is a TV in the mirror as well. I'll admit that on Sunday morning, I soaked in the tub and watched basketball - it was awesome. Our view completely sucked but that's what we get for using Priceline I bet (don't be jealous but we had views of the highway and the Stratosphere).

We don't mind walking, so the fact we were off the Strip didn't bother us. It's about a five minute walk to the Wynn and about 30 minutes to Bally's and Planet Hollywood which are in the center of the Strip. If you want to go to the Strip and have fun, but come back to a quiet hotel with no casino where you don't have to walk a huge distance to get to the room elevators, the Trump is not a bad place to stay. We're glad we tried it out, but we prefer other hotels in LV.",2

1001,2,1548288000000,"LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE!

Can you tell I really love this place? If you haven't guessed already, I do.

I had heard many things about RCC through Charlotte blogs and other social media, so once I noticed a Groupon for this place I finally had the perfect excuse to go visit. The groupon included a brewery tour, two glasses of cider, and two logo glasses (FYI, the brewery tours are free for anyone). We enjoyed the brewery tour and learned a whole lot more about cider than I thought already knew. After we ordered a flight just to get an idea of everything we had. The Cherry Trolls cider really is as good as everyone says. Nice and fresh with a sweet ending. The jalapeno/pineapple one had a surprising amount of jalapeno flavor in it, yet without the heat. The blackberry one was good without a lot of sweetness to it, which was wonderful as well. The coffee one just wasn't for me, but if you love coffee you'll definitely enjoy it.

After our flight we went back up to order our drinks. I ordered the earl grey and while it sounds strange to use tea in a cider it was absolutely fantastic. If you're a tea drinker you'll enjoy it as much as I did. Fair warning, you might want someone else to drive you there that isn't planning on drinking. Before I knew it I was more tipsy than I planned on being. I drank everything way too fast. Then again everything was so delicious it's hard to take your time drinking.

I'm very much a wine person and not at all a beer person. For once it was nice to enjoy the brewery scene without being the person not drinking. The service was top notch and the atmosphere was very casual and welcoming. I'm planning on visiting again soon, there's still a lot of ciders I wasn't able to try.",2

For shared appetizer we like the rough cut tuna nachos (basically a poke), queso fundido, and for something different the smoked salmon quesadilla.  Bread basket is a treat with both sweet and savory muffins, scones, biscuits, and bread. For entrees we usually stick to hot dishes - spicy chicken sweet potato hash, chilequiles, salmon. Grits and the bacon are favorite sides. I'd say skip the tenderloin sandwich (cold deli style), and the salads unless that's what you are in the mood for. Steak and eggs is a make your own taco dish which is huge, more than enough for one person. Salmon is another great treat! Also note that you can only get the churros at dinner time for dessert.",2

My husband did the build your own pasta and got chicken alfredo. I got the chicken parm sandwich and both were delicious. 
Kayla was attentive and also told us about the free refills on my husbands pasta. 
Since it was our first time there, Kayla gave us a free cookie too!! She really made our visit! The food was good, but since we already had a bad ""taste"" in our mouth (because of always having to go somewhere else because of a 45+ minute wait) if we had just had mediocre service, we probably wouldn't have came back.

I really enjoyed my experience here! The service was friendly and efficient. There was no pressure to order wine or a drink if we didn't want to or an appetizer for that matter, which I appreciate.

I ordered the margharita pizza; a great way to judge a pizza restaurant as it's the simplest of pizzas. The tomato sauce on the pizza was delicious and I loved the taste of the crust because of the wood-burning oven. However, I did find the middle of the pizza a little soggy probably because the dough was so thin and it's not as good once it cools down. I knew we were going to order the nutella dessert pizza to share (I had never tried one before), so I ate 2/3 of my pizza (could've easily finished it) and took the rest to go. 

The nutella pizza was the star here. Perfectly cooked, the nutella melted in my mouth and I wanted to eat the whole thing but restricted myself to 2 slices. I would go back just for that. Having spent less than $25 with taxes and tips, I don't find it crazy expensive though I didn't order any drinks or appetizers.

I met my family here for lunch this week and wasn't super-impressed by anything in particular, but wasn't disappointed either. 

Let's start with what I did like: 

- They have a decent amount of lunch options. I would suggest taking a look at their half salad with soup or sandwich options. My sister and mother tried the ham and cheese panini with a chop salad. Both looked pretty tasty, but then again, when isn't melted cheese with ham good? My uncle tired the chicken parm sandwich and although he didn't say much, his plate was clean! 

- Chop Salad: pretty decent size and dressed salad for a ""half-size."" We all swapped out the blue cheese crumbles, since for some reason no one in my family likes it--and it was still good. Nothing super special, but good. 

- Gnocchi with Italian sausage: Lately I've been letting myself indulge on whatever I want and this vodka sauce dish was pretty tasty. The gnocchi didn't taste homemade, but it was still good. The sauce was pretty tasty too. Overall it didn't knock my socks off, but it was a decent, chain restaurant dish. 

- Service: There was only maybe one hiccup, but otherwise, our server was really nice. She seemed a little frazzled, but was always smiling and very helpful.

I didn't like: 

- SUPER large lunch menu: Too many options for lunch, which makes me think not a lot of what they serve is all that fresh. They could cut that menu in half and still have too many options. This isn't dinner time. 

- HUGE, but shallow plates: Our table was hella-cramped with just three people and when my pasta dish came out, there was no room for this plate the size of my torso. Still, the guy helping our server made me feel like it was my job to figure out where we were going to put it. Nope. The portion was also a bit too large for lunch, and because the plate was so huge and shallow, my gnocchi got ice cold in mere minutes. Toss those plates, please. Figure out a better, more appealing way to serve your pasta.

- It's really dark, you guys! I'm only 29 and I felt like I needed reading glasses... at lunch time. 

- Chain-y... It just feels and tastes really chain restaurant... because, well.. it is! But I've also been to some chains that fooled me. I think Maggiano's could step their game up a lot. When we asked our server  about the tomato bisque, so told us the kitchen just put their alfredo sauce in tomato soup. Maybe I'm the only one, but that threw me off... big time. Not only does it sound like a short-cut a restaurant shouldn't be taking (considering how easy it is to make homemade tomato soup), but when they're cutting corners that I wouldn't even cut when I'm cooking at home, that's a big no-no for me. 

- No lunch-sized pasta portions, unless you want to do buy one, get one to take home thing... which, I didn't.",2

Not a fan of the ""tender"" steak or chicken. Veggies are good, it's a shame they cost extra if you want them included.

We recently went to see ""The Great Gatsby"", ten minutes into the movie two different parties arrived with their one and two year olds in tow.  One crawled up and down the stairs, wandered through the seating and baby talked for much of the movie, while the other small child talked, fussed, cried and sang the alphabet during the death scene of J Gatsby.  The mother and her friend found this to be funny and charming, with no real efforts to quiet him made at any of the numerous disruptions.  I spoke with employees midway through the movie but they did nothing more then watch during the three or four minutes they were in the theater. When speaking to a manager after, he admitted they are afraid of denying parents with disruptive children the opportunity to see a movie because of the problems they have been known to cause.  While I understand his dilemma,this effectively translates into making thoughtless parents happy at the expense of all of the other paying patrons who came to enjoy a classic film.  While I am certain other theaters have this problem as well, it seems to be pervasive at this one.  Perhaps an answer to this problem is to have all movie goers pay, even the very young ones.  This may encourage some of these parents to find a babysitter of use the childcare available at this theater.

I thought I am the only one who had a TERRIBLE experience with his UNPROFESSIONAL STAFFS INCLUDING THE OFFICE MANAGER. It was the worst experienced I had since I started wearing eyeglasses and contact lens.
I seldom make any reviews and comments. But this time I think I need to write something about their POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.
I started visiting their clinic last February of this year, I already noticed that the front desk staff are not Blessed about what RESPECT and VALUE is all about. I did not feel that customer service from the very beginning. I was there to get a prescription for my contact lens. I tried contacts for a week, Dr. Ohriner said that he will have his staff call me for follow ups on my trial contact lens. Well, no one called me and I had to call them and make a my follow up appointment. I received my new contact lens prescription Feb 13. I was issued a MULTIFOCAL Alcon Dailies for $44 only good for 2 weeks but after a week I felt uncomfortable with the new contact lens.So, I went back for a new appointment and I tried new contact lens on the day of my appointment. March 26, when my prescription was changed and NEW CONTACTS (HIGH) where ordered the same day. April 4 when I picked up the new contacts and to find out that they ordered WRONG CONTACT LENS. SO, they promised that they will have it mailed overnight. April 9, I called their office because I never received any from the mail. This lady said that they had the COMPANY directly mailed the contact to my address. These people are saying different story and the fact that they are not really doing their job because they do not know to do completely do it. April 18, still nothing from the mail so I went to their office and spoke with the OFFICE MANAGER, I was telling her what happened and seems she doesn't care or listen but instead asked my name. But I still told her what happened and I requested a REFUND. And, honestly no CUSTOMER SERVICE QUALITY, I never heard anything from her mouth, she just went to the computer, asked for my CARD and refunded my money, just like that. I hope Dr. Ohriner would read this and reach his attention because his employeed are making his business look really very bad, so unfortunate on his part . Dr. Ohriner is very nice  and smart but  totally the opposite of his employees.
I never had any problem with previous OD CONRAD LOCHNER III and at Red Rock Eye Care.And I can make good recommendations for them.

We replaced almost all of the flooring in our 2900 square foot home. This was a big project and I am so glad we trusted it to Flooring America of Chandler.

The staff in the showroom took the time to help me find the perfect tile and they worked hard to make sure it was available to be installed on exactly the days I needed.  Dale gave great advice at each step and the installation team was professional, trustworthy, and extremely hard working.  Together they turned around our entire house in less than a week--though we expected the project to take much, much longer.  Dale even went out of his way to order replacement molding for our wood floors, even though this was not part of the original project.

We asked if we could please sit away from it and she was okay with that, I think? lol My husband ordered the chicken curry with mild spice and it was okay.

1317,1,1548633600000,"Nightmare!

I went last night with my friends for my birthday:  We waited for over two hours for our table (since they would not take reservations). The original offer for a table (after waiting for an hour already) was to split our party into the two separate rooms of the restaurant at twe very distant tables. The server that offered this was not only curt, but her words were ""it makes it really hard on us"" to seat our party. Personally, having worked in the industry for ten years, i would NEVER say something to this affect to a paying customer!  When we were finally seated, there were only a chips and salsa appetizer for almost fifteen minutes before our order was ever taken. When our food was finally delivered, two of the persons in the group were not served. Their food was not delivered to the table until everyone else was finished with our over cooked and very dry tacos. This was something that was never acknowledged as a short coming on the restaurants behalf. At the risk of sounding cheap, there was never an offer to comp their plates, or compensate in any matter.  When it came time to deliver the bill, the server had no idea who had what. The bills were jumbled, and as a matter of fact some of them were even PAID TWICE (considering one of our party felt sympathetic to the futile efforts of the staff and stayed behind as the rest of the party left and later found out the tab had actually been paid) !!! Fortunately for the server, he was paid AND TIPED double for at least one of the tabs for his less than mediocre efforts. I will NEVER return to this restaurant, and recommend anyone with more than three, or four people in their party not confuse and overwhelm the staff by their presence. 

Horrible service, food and poor attitudes!",1
1322,2,1548460800000,"What is not great to say about Tobias' Automotive Specialists.  Let me start from the beginning:  

My wife and I were not seeing eye to eye on my career choice.  Being a former analytical therapist, and recently realizing that I wanted to be an actor, my wife forced me out of my house and made me live in my car.  Luckily, it was a newer GMC diesel truck, so there was plenty of room.  Here is where Tobias' Automotive Specialists came to help.  

I was adding some BlueDef Exhaust Fluid to my truck and I spilled it all over myself.  My brother in law was nearby and asked me if I was OK.  Admitting to him that I was afraid I just blue myself, he asked what I was trying to do.  I explained to him the situation with my wife, and that in an effort to save money I had tried to practice working on my car.  Unfortunately during this practice I had prematurely blown my wad on car parts, and now had a bit of a mess on my hands; as I had essentially ruined my truck by practicing on it.

My brother in law then told me about Tobias' Automotive Specialists.  They worked with me from day one to repair my truck.  Being a struggling actor who had yet to take one in the can as far as gigs go, they gave me a fair price on all of the repairs on my truck.  I was so pleased with their service that I packed their sweet pink mouths with ice cream after I picked up my truck!!!

Thank you Tobias' Automotive Specialists!!! You really are a queen in my book!",2

Drinks menu was decent, got a malbec which was quite good, a few italian and other beers, nothing too surprising.  Complimentary warm fresh bread was a highlight - we were hungry!

Bruschetta was middling.  Of the 4 pieces, 3 were crispy and soft, almost perfect, but one was soggy from tomatoes.  The house salad was very good and nice that there were 3 size options.  Linguine tutto marre ringed by mussels when it arrived, had a nice flavor with mushroom and light garlic sauce, but skimped a bit on the quantity of seafood.  Porcini and truffle cappellacci (mushroom stuffed raviolis) were tasty.  But both entrees were heavy on the salt, pushing our boundaries as salt-lovers.  Passed on dessert but did taste test the chocolate cake, which was huge and good enough.  

Around the table the portions were gigantic; there was plenty to take home.  The service was attentive, thoughtful, and friendly.  The atmosphere sitting in the bar was festive but allowed us to still talk to one another without shouting.  It was a nice night; having higher quality food and more creative options would have made it nicer.  This was a solid dining experience but nothing to get excited about.",3

The tortas (Mexican sandwiches) are 6-7 and they have a handful of other Mexican staples but still accommodating the whitewashed options you find at Philly b' s.

Probably one of the nicest restaurants in LV! Even though I don't eat meat, I thought it was really cool how they bring the meat on a cart and slice it all right in front of you!

1390,1,1547337600000,"I fully agree with reviewers who call the food bland, and overall, I think there are much better dining options for the money in the vicinity.  I have tried a number of items on the menu here and found them to be all underwhelming, despite the fact that their average entree costs nearly $20.

For example, the hanger steak has come out under-seasoned and chewy, the braised short ribs tasting no better than ones you can easily make at home -- again despite being roughly $20 or more each.  The starters that I have had were also very uninspiring, such as the hummus which is, at best, on par with store-bought hummus.  For a restaurant at this price point, it is simply not worth the money.

For ""cheap"" eats in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh, I prefer options like BRGR or Dinette.  At either of those locations, entrees are less expensive while much more consistent and flavorful.",2

1) Caesar salad: It's like any other Caesar salad but you can taste a hint of anchovies in this one.  The romaine they used was fresh & crisp and the sauce wasn't overwhelming.  There was also a good amount of ""tartness"" to the sauce. 

2) Oyster Rockefeller: I've eaten this dish twice.  You get 3 in one order and it is delicious!  Bacon makes everything great and their oyster is a fair size as well.  Their sauce is also just right - not too salty, not too bland. 

3) Crab cakes: I probably am just not a fan of horseradish but I found the taste of the horseradish way too overpowering in this crab cake.  I wasn't a fan of those but from other Yelpers here, it seems like it's a pretty popular dish so it may just be me. 

4) Tuna tartare: The tuna is fresh but the tartare was just okay.  It wasn't horrible but I wouldn't say it's the best tartare I've had.  The sauce was a bit too bland for my liking. 

5) Lobster bisque: I've gone to their store before and tried their canned version they have in store and it was horrible so I was a little scared to try this one.  However, I am glad I did!  The lobster bisque here is not too salty and not too bland.  There is a very strong lobster taste and there are even chunks of lobster in there.  I was one happy gal drinking that soup!

6) Seafood mixed grill: This plate really isn't that small.  It has one whole piece of salmon filet, 3 scallops, and 3 tiger shrimps.  I am not a scallop eater but the other two fish were very fresh and delicious.  I wish the tiger shrimp was a little more buttery.  Apparently the scallops are made to perfection - not overdone but not chewy and raw.  It comes with a quinoa & mixed grilled vegetable side but if you want mashed potatoes, they can do that instead. 

7) Grilled butterfield seabream: This is DELICIOUS.  For those of you who are not afraid of bones in fish, you MUST try this one.  I can go on and on and on about this dish but I definitely will be getting this again.  The sea bream is extremely fresh and you can taste the fish but it's no an overpowering type of taste.  It is indeed buttery and sprinkled with some lemon juice, it was one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had. 

Overall, my experience at Diana's thus far has been great.  I've only gone to the restaurant twice but both times, the service has been good and the food has been good as well.  I'd definitely be going back.",2

The best sausage I may have ever had (mind you I live in the sausage capital of N America, Chicago). 

Try the Kranjska with grilled onions and jalapeños and add the deli mustard. The crunchy bun along with the smoky sausage and the savory sweet/hot onions, peppers and mustard make for a fantastic combo. The fries are great too-get the tomato curry if you like spice (which clearly I do).

Five Guys Famous Burgers and Fries.

I first encountered Five Guys in Atlanta, so it's fitting that it's my crossover review... and man, is Cleveland lucky that they've arrived!  I was so happy to walk through the door of the new location at the Strongsville mall.  

These Guys are amazing.  The menu is simple: you can order a regular burger or cheeseburger (2 patties) or a ""little"" burger or cheeseburger, all available with bacon, if desired.  That's it.  From there, you order your toppings (which are FREE, no matter WHAT you choose), and perhaps grab a drink and some fries.

Perhaps?  Let me rephrase that: you BEST get some fries, because they're REAL fries, not those over-processed sticks you get from fast food places.  They're also cooked in peanut oil, so kudos for no cholesterol.  You can get the regular, Five Guys style fries, or Cajun fries, which I have yet to try but will surely sample on my next visit.  Which might be in about five minutes, because I'm making myself hungry.  Never too early for a burger, right?

Ah, back to the burgers.

Five Guys' motto is ""Fresh, never frozen"", and man, you can taste it.  The burgers are juicy and full of flavor, and the toppings are fresh and plentiful.  Mouth-watering, I tell ya.  NOTE: you are GOING to get messy with all the juicy-condiment-fantasticness, so just accept it and enjoy.  Trust me, it's worth it.

The restaurant is as laid-back as the menu, just a simple setup of chairs at tables and counters with a red-and-white-checked decor.  Kind of an old-school burger joint feel without foraying into throwback 50's kitschy-ness.  (Though I'm not knocking a true 50's diner, don't get me wrong - but that's another review.)

Basically, with the satisfying flavors, reasonable prices, and simple but comfy atmosphere, I never want to eat fast food burgers again - give me Five Guys Burgers and Fries any day!  Welcome to Cleveland!

The sauces are pretty tasty but I have no idea what's actually in them because there's no descriptions of them. The dirty sauce kind of seemed like a thick garlicky aioli, more like a spread than a sauce.

We decided to have a dim sum lunch here on a Sunday with relatives -10 people at this table! 

Their dim sum was actually pricey. Do they have specials? We visited here at 11am and left at around 1-2pm... so it was a long lunch but we probably caught the ""morning prices"" because they were expensive!! The prices were, in my opinion, more towards the ""premium dim sum"" side but the food was only average. 

I also thought their menu was quite short! Yes they have the typical shrimp dumplings, pork siu mai, and even the abalone soup dumpling (which was a joke! The abalone was so tiny, I wish they'd just skip it!!). When I go for dim sum at other restaurants, I am able to happily check off at least 10 items... but at Diamond Banquet Hall, for some reason I checked off only 2.. and I handed the menu off to relatives. Maybe I didn't understand the fancy names? Maybe I didn't like that the dishes I'd order were mostly under ""L"" or ""XL""? *

MEH. I'm giving this 2 stars because the food wasn't terrible... it was just average. But I wouldn't visit again on my own***

1465,2,1548720000000,"This place has the worst entrance policy ever! We came here last Saturday and were disgusted by the way the staff at Maya treat their patrons. There was a long line which we patiently waited in for approximately 45 minutes in 100 degree weather only to be told, once we got to the front, that they were only letting people in who bought bottle service.  I guess we should have realized in advance when we kept seeing people in front leave the line, but it's hard to tell what's going on in front when you're in the back.  Someone (who actually made it inside) was leaving the club and walked by the line and told us the inside was empty! It was evident that they were only allowing in those who had bottle service reservations and groups of girls only.  So if you come here without reserving a table or with a guy in your group, chances are, you are not going to be allowed in without at least having to wait a significant amount of time and in some cases, maybe not at all.  Maya is so overt about their gender discrimination that it is outrageous. 

 Maya needs to put its EGO in check because if you continue to treat your potential clients this way, they will never become actual clients or repeat clients because your actions are so deplorable.   I've been to so many clubs and have never had such a bad experience, not even in Vegas.  At least in Vegas, the lines are long , but they move relatively fast and once you make it to the front, you are ALLOWED in.  What's the point of having an entrance fee ($10)  if your policy is to only let in people who purchase bottle service or are females?!   If that's your policy, then at least have the common courtesy to let people in line know so they don't melt in the 100 degree heat. Clearly, you want to give the impression that the club is so popular that there are lines out the door.  Hopefully, people will read all of these negative reviews about your ""exclusive"" club and realize that the lines are just a facade to try and entice club-goers to visit Maya. According to multiple reviews, while it looks busy on the outside, the inside is ""dead."" Irregardless of its popularity, Maya has left such a horrible impression that I am going to take my business (and referrals) elsewhere-to places that demonstrate their appreciation for the client, which Maya clearly DOES NOT! You really should be ashamed of your conduct thus far.",2
1468,1,1548374400000,"This is my third time staying here, and once again, it was great. When I arrived, I got a Vintage room, and it was definitely old school. It was very spacious and looked out at the old rooftop. I think the thermostat was broken because I cranked it up to 85, turned it on high, and it was still pretty cold. Opened the windows to let in some air to warm it up a bit. 
Had dinner at Pizza Lotto and it was good new York style pizza; very good customer service. Also had lunch at the Subway; no complaints. They are pretty stingy about checking your phone at the table games--had to stand up away from the table just to check on a dinner reservation. As it has been well documented, there are several old school secrets in the hotel--one of them happens to be in the Vintage level. The one labeled room with a door key is #234 on the 2nd floor of the Vintage level area. All the other rooms are four digits long and have the card key system installed. This room is not open to the public but is still in use. Chalk this up to another interesting aspect of the El Cortez. Can't wait to go back!",2

Our bartender was really quick with the drinks and really knowledgeable about the area.  I didn't know that this place didn't serve food so when we asked for a menu we weren't given an attitude.  What we got was some really nice input about some of the food options around the place.

1482,2,1546819200000,"I have been to SideBar a few times now and have enjoyed myself each time. It is a kind of tucked away place on 7th Ave and McDowell. If you can believe it, it is located on top of a Pei Wei. When you go it does feel like you are in on some sort of secret. 

The parking for this place is ample. Although, the walk to and from the bar can be a little treacherous as there has been puddles on the way back every time. At least one person goes shin deep each time. 

The ambiance is a very cool, hip one. There are plenty of couches and chairs, along with some larger tables. The bar area has several high tops. Seating at the bar is available also. The seats are just at a premium. There is music playing all the time, but it is not so loud that you can't have a conversation with the few people sitting around you. 

I have only had beer, so I am unsure of the mixed drink prices. There beer selection is pretty extensive. Being a skunky beer lover, I usual go with Stella or Pilsner Urquell. I you haven't had this Czech beer I highly recommend it. Its name means ""First Pilsner"" in Czech. learned that on an episode of ""Three Sheets"". They have your standard domestics and a lot of domestic micro brews. Something for everyone I imagine.

We waited approx 40 minutes. The place was about half empty. So I walked in to check why we haven't been seated yet. The young girl came back with the reason that we had a lot of people not respond to their text messages and it would be another ten minutes. You gotta be kidding me! The staff is too young and they should have some guidance. If there was a manager watching what was happening they should have stepped in. We left. We have eaten here before.

1489,2,1546732800000,"I have been going to this location for 7 years.  We live just 1.5 miles away and have always come to this location. I go this this location about 3 times per week because I crazy about Chipotle; I even won the catering for the summer rewards. anyways; I went yesterday and ordered a bowl. they quickly finished up my bowl because I usually get the same thing. Cari(employee) was wrapping a huge burrito but she was having a little bit of trouble which happens sometimes since some people try to pack the burrito too much. I understand, so I looked over and there was a guy who  ""bags the food"" and the woman who cashes out; they are both just watching Cari as she struggles to wrap this astronomical burrito. so, since my bowl is done i just move around the person in front of me and have the two employees who are just staring doing nothing and ask them to ring me up as there are is a line building up. Cari, with a strong tone of voice, says that i cannot cut this customer and that i need to wait for him. i said ""excuse me"" she says you can't short cut him, he is next. the other two employees said nothing and just didn't ring me up. they didn't want to help me and i just waited for her to finish up the burrito wrapping extravaganza.  she kept trying to explain why i had to wait instead of focusing on the customer at hand; the customer had no problem with me cutting but Cari kept trying to explain why i had to wait; i finally told her that i didn't want to talk to her any more and asked for her name. after they cashed out the customer with the fattest burrito I'd ever seen; then they rung me up and never apologized for anything. i felt that they were rude and did not handle this situation well. i am disappointed in how this location is run lately and wanted to share my comments. i don't know if i will return. :(",2
1497,3,1547251200000,"Let's be honest, shopping at Marc's is awful. But alas, I still find myself there because it's really close to work and the you can't beat the prices. Marc's is just so damn cheap which is good because I'm pretty damn cheap too. There usually isn't anything wrong with the quality of their groceries and I get a kick out of browsing the close-outs, but there is just something about the Marc's shopping experience that makes me crazy. 

First of all, if you go to the store for 10 things there is a good chance they will only carry about 6 of them. They have the most inconsistent inventory ever. They employ a lot of High School kids.... I'll just leave it at that when describing the customer service. But the absolute worst part is check out. Previously mentioned under-age employees can't ring up their own alcohol so you often have to wait for a manager to come scan it for them. They accept cash, check, EBT and Discover... which means slow moving lines and more manager-approval wait time. Not to mention there always seems to be approximately 3 lanes open during peak hours. And what the hell is up with their bags??? I usually try to be a good citizen and bring my own reusable bags but when I happen to forget them their bags are so thin that they usually have to double or triple them up. How is that cost saving? Search me.

In sum, Marcs--the necessary evil for the cheapskate shopper like me. I will continue to moan and groan but I will enjoy saving money on the basics.",2
1500,3,1546300800000,"Duff's Famous Wings is located on the north side of College between Euclid and Manning in Little Italy.

Duff's is a legend back in Buffalo and this place pays homage to the original back in Amherst not very far from where I've bought numerous sets of tires at Dunn Tire.  I've never been to the original though, never and as far as Buffalo goes I've only been to the Anchor original once.  My impression of the Anchor was that is wasn't that great.  Perhaps my expectations were higher because of the name but really nothing stood out as superb regardless of them being the original or not.

Duff's I've seen win against the Anchor on Food Wars so since each has their following I figure I should try Duff's.  We have numerous locations for both Anchor and Duff's in the GTA so although this isn't the original I'm guessing they go by the same standards and recipes.

We went to the place on a Thursday (March 22) and I have to say the place was packed, packed and noisy, very noisy.  I found ourselves having to almost scream to talk.  I was amazed how noisy it was inside.  I get it though it's a sports bar with wings and beer.  That is like a magnet for sports loving men like me.  Honestly I just wanted to eat there and try their chicken.  My friend Monica was taking us out for an early birthday dinner for me and it was a short walk from their place.

My wife ordered lemon pepper and I had asked for the hot.  The menu says something to the effect that mild is medium, medium is hot and hot is very hot.  That's sort of a subjective statement but I suppose if you're going by what others out there consider to be mild, medium and hot I guess that's one way to measure.  I still went with their hot but not death or the even hotter because I want to gauge how it is first.  I'm necessarily looking for the hottest wings although I like a hot bite from time to time.  

The hot wasn't really hot for me but it definitely had a decent sting to it.  I could have gone hotter but it wasn't really necessary.  I liked the flavor and the chicken.  The drums portions of the wings were large but the flats portions seems almost disproportionate to the size of the drums.  I'd expect bigger flats with larger drums on split wings.  I could be mistaken but it was my observation.  I've eaten a lot of fried chicken in my life to know.  I'm guessing roaster wings but again, larger drums to flats but it could have just been our batch.  Being large and by the pound don't expect more than a bowl for a pound which is about 8 large pieces.  The wings were naked, and sauced quite well.  The sauce was not conservative by any means on the hot wings.  The tang and smell was great, not too much of a vinegar tang but a saucy sting.  

Gauging the hot being the way it was I'm happy I didn't order medium because I think their hot for me is in the Goldilocks zone.  I like my wings just about what they served as hot.  Any hotter would have been fine but the flavor was great.  

Along with the wings they give generous servings of both dill and blue cheese along with veg to dip. We also had their fried pickles and mac and cheese bites.  Both were good but the star of this place is their wings.  Big, meaty sauced and tasty.  I had one honey garlic to try and it was also good.  I'd be interested to try other flavors.  The dry ones like what my wife had (lemon pepper) were also very good.  Usually when I eat a lot of wings I like to have a variety of both sauced and dry.

The appetizers were good, the wings were better than just good.  The roasters alone is something you won't see as commonly used and while Duff's may be famous I can safely say they're much more satisfying and in my overall opinion they're just better than what the Anchor has to offer.

The only downside to this place is that it can be rather loud.  I'm assuming it would be even worse during a Leafs game or some other hometown game.",2
1502,2,1548028800000,"Guess this place just has a fun play around vibe. I'm comparing it to a place I used to go to that had games & food but was a hot spot to hang out at night! Took my 10 year old boy cousin and he had a LOT of fun!! From racing/shooting games to the ticket games! But the prizes were kinda ticketed too high for what my cousin could get on $20. Maybe kinda lower some of the prize ticket amounts an it would be good for the kids to want to come back. But this time around..was good! 
Went on a Thursday night. It was in the summer so it was very full with both kids and adults having fun. But my experience wasn't anything to brag about. I'm a huge games playing girl (went to fun factory - hawaii growing up) but gameworks was soooo nothing to love. Like I have no desire to go back..even if I had nothing to do. The layout was horrible. The food sitting area felt bigger then the games area! I think there was only 2 games that I wanted to play that was working. All the others were ""out of service"". Gameworks has only been open maybe a week when I went..why were the games broken? The whole design just felt like it was just put there..no thought put into the interior design.

Secondly, when asked for my signature when I first arrived I asked what for since I've never been asked to sign in the past. He said it's just something new they do. Come to find out, it's so that they can up charge you behind your back but have your signature to validate it. I will NEVER return.

During our date, this was our last spot. I guess it's true when they say ""SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST"" because this was definitely an out of this city experience.

When you find the bar and walk in, it looks a little intimidating, but DON'T BE FOOLED! As soon as we walked in, I fell in love with everything in there! The bar is inspired by Prague's Strahov Monastery Library, and is absolutely gorgeous! The wall is made of bookshelves with actual books (somewhat like the Library Bar in Los Angeles), the sofas and seats make me feel as if I have left Las Vegas for the night, and the drinks were all so unique, and ones you wouldn't find at your local Las Vegas nightclub.

I tried The Lady Sylvia because I'm a nerd, but it is now one of my favorite drinks! It has a citrus taste to it, and will make you feel like dancing!! =)

NOTE: This place is a smoke-free environment though, so smoke outside before you come inside!

He did not examine my knee himself.

2.  I picked two sides instead of an entree:  mac and cheese (with pancetta) and chilled bean salad.  Both superb and actually, a great pairing.
He had the pork hash (?)  Also fantastic.

A soak in the ultra deep bath tub sounds dope, or a rinse in the shower with water pouring from the ceiling.

Maybe head downstairs to the small, sultry lounge for a cocktail or two.

I think it's really awesome that they have free slushies and water for folks who are waiting.  How accommodating!   I also really liked their decor...like their retro Korean movie posters and advertisements.  They had a cool vintage TV in the men's room I just had to check out and I noticed they have free toothbrushes and mouthwash.  Yeah I went into the men's room.  I'm a rebel like that.  

The five of us were seated at a small, round table and we had utensils and banchan all ready for us.   Our host for the evening  wasn't the friendliest and there was a severe language barrier.  One person in our party was accidentally seated in front of the grill controls and she nudged him out of the way.  I thought that was kinda rude...she should have asked him to move.  She wasn't able to answer most questions about the banchan and outright ignored some questions.  She needs a massage or a vacation or something...relax a little bit, lady!

She absolutely knows what shes doing.  Not only is her work fantastic but she is also such a warm hearted person. She listens to you and makes the effort to get to know you as a person which is a great thing to do with your clients. She knows how to carry a conversation. She makes you feel very comfortable.

1722,2,1546646400000,"I love Brocach ever since I discovered their corned beef and cabbage.  It's the best corned beef I've ever had.  Deliciously tender with streaks of melt in your mouth fatty goodness throughout.  It's paired with mashed potatoes and cabbage, and topped with slices of fried carrots.  The cabbage is cooked soft but not mushy.  The carrot slices give the dish a crunch.  It's their best dish, in my opinion, and I've certainly turned a couple of people who were previously meh to corned beef to realizing it's the best thing ever once they tried Brocach's version.  

The other thing I love about Brocach is the way they make my drink.  I often order a whiskey highball with ginger beer, splash of bitters, and lots of lemon.  Because I'm not particularly specific when I order this drink, it's different at every bar.  But no matter where I go, Brocach makes the best version of this drink.  I don't know if it's because of their whiskey (I ask for rail whiskey), their ginger beer, or their bitters, but this is definitely my favorite drink ever.  

Ooo, and their lounge fries are decadent and a little dangerous.  I always have to make sure there are several people to share them with or I end up eating way too much of it all by myself.  It's fries covered in cheese, bits of bacon, tomatoes, drizzled in some barbeque sauce and other delicious goodness.  It's so bad for me but too tasty for me to care.",2

Strike 1. Atmosphere isn't just lacking, it's downright awkward and uncomfortable. The old hibachi hoods are still over tables that no ""exhibition cooking"" happens at. Exhaust hoods, these ones at least, are not design elements and should not still be hanging here. The booths were so uncomfortably arranged we had to switch seats because the table was so far from the booth we could not comfortably reach the table. 

Then chips and salsa, the staple of all Mexican restaurants. Next strike. The salsa was generic like from a jar and the chips were the ultra thick kind with no flavor, yuck.  Speaking of no flavor, the food was bland, beyond bland and I felt over priced for what it was. Sadly even my diet Coke was gross.

Definitely will not be back. 

If you're heading here from Charlotte go the extra mile to Casa Rita's and if you came from Monroe or Matthews, turn around...a way better Mexican meal awaits you down the road.  By the way, I am in NO way associated with Casa Rita's, just a big fan of theirs.  

Oh and the sanitation score is from the old Korean restaurant, I thought that was a little weird.",2
1740,3,1546905600000,"I'm sad even writing this, because we used to go here religiously. I believe they went through some obvious changes, not sure if new ownership or management but it definitely changed in a bad way. Let me just explain in points.

1) Walked in at around 9:15pm. Was greeted by a worker, told us she can still seat us (whatever that means). I looked at the hours on their door, and it said they closed at 11! I'm my mind, okay, we have time.

2) We sat down, and the same lady AGAIN mentions, ""DONT TOUCH the knob (duh). We close at 11, so make sure you get the food, and hurry"" SOMETHING like that, I couldn't quite understand her. Keep in mind, it's not 11 yet.

3) We get our food, and she comes back yet again to ask if we are okay... And AGAIN MENTIONS that they are closing soon!! Talk about pressure! 

4) Another lady comes and this one is better. She somewhat apologizes for the other lady telling us to hurry and tells us we can eat until it closes. Thanks lady! She then gives us more rice like we asked for and puts it on our table because they're starting to put everything away.... At 10:15pm??

5) Not okay, they're mopping, cleaning, and putting food away WHILE we are eating. I couldn't help but NOT enjoy the rest of my time eating while also checking the time because I felt like we were the ones disrespecting the time.

6) overall, NOT enjoyable like how we used
To enjoy it there. They don't even give ice cream (like how it was before). They even raised the price. For what?! If anything, if the service is going to be WAY lower, lower the price SUPER lower! Food lower quality, and unsanitary. Not worth it anymore, sorry to say. I'm sorry to say that I don't think we will be coming here anymore

I finally went in and check it out this afternoon, since I have no time for a sit down lunch and takeout seems like a much better idea.

When I entered the store, I was greeted warmly.. but I really have no idea what should I get and what tastes good! I think eat in an Indian restaurant once in my whole life time.

Thanks for the lady at the counter being so helpful. Answering all my questions! Since none of the items are labelled.
 
""What is that?"" ""What is this?""
""It is spicy?"" ""It is sweet?""
""What's inside?""
""How does it taste like?""

Even when she told me what that is, I am still not sure.... 
She was really nice offer to let me tast the yellow looking rice (which is really spicy fried rice with chicken) and a pastry like mini donut thing that is salty...(I still not sure what that is) If I can taste everything  :)!

Anyway, I decide with Biryani (chicken fried rice), 1 chicken curries and 2 Vaaipan (brown baseball looking thing, she told me is sweet with banana inside). The meal also comes with a tomato salad full of chilli pepper, yeah!!!

I have to tell you the food is really good. Spicy enough that I don't need to add anymore hot sauce. But the smell is really strange, the whole office ask me what I am having for lunch!

But I'm warning you now if you don't have the time to spare then go somewhere else. So kinka opens for lunch at 11:30 I got there at 12 and was seated promptly. My friend and I ordered soon after. She got the ramen and I got the kaisen don (sushi on rice). Surprisingly her ramen was the last order that day. I don't quite understand how that can be when the restaurant just opened and it wasn't even full. But anyways we waited 45 mins and we finally got something, her ramen. Presentation was as it should be and portion was big compared to others. I didn't try it so can't say much on taste. Then I waited 10 mins still no sushi on rice in sight. I spoke to the waiter he said kitchen is backed up. Then I waited another 10 mins and told the waiter I'm done. Cancel my order because it doesn't make sense why mine would take this long to make and by this time my friend was pretty much done her meal. Their reasoning: lunch hours is new so they're still working on it (well tell people so they can decide if they want to commit an hour wait for food), her ramen was faster because someone else ordered it and left because it was taking too long (other people walked out) last I can't cancel it because they're ""making it"" (which at this point I know it wasn't true). So I  watched them and I saw the head chef make eye contact with my table and walk into the kitchen and then i knew he was making it. And finally after more than an hour my food came. I must say it is not worth an hour wait but it was still delicious. Which is why I still give them 3 stars. If I could I would give 2.5 stars because to me service is a big part of my dining experience. And they did not deliver in service. The sushi on rice had some salmon, tuna, surf clam and a giant sweet shrimp on top of perfectly cooked rice. It was really good but I just wish I didn't have to wait over an hour for it.",3
1793,3,1548460800000,"Where do we begin with a testimonial for Lisa Buzelli? With nothing but positive feedback, it is hard to know where to start.

My husband and I are absolutely thrilled with the service we received from Lisa. We started working with her about 9 months ago (our first thought with a move to the Las Vegas area) and she, from the beginning, has been ever so helpful. My husband is active duty military and with this we had a lot of back and forth with trying to accomplish our goal to get to Las Vegas. Lisa was always very patient....and even when we had to take a break from house hunting due to our military situation and uncertainty about whether or not we would actually make it out to Vegas, she checked up on us. Lisa wanted us to know that if we ever had questions or concerns that she would be available to us. Lisa never left us in the dark. She was there for us and she cared about finding us our dream home and dream location.

In a market that is being bought up by investors, it is difficult to find a first dream home in a dream location. You fall in love with many, but many come unavailable. Not to be discouraged- Lisa works hard, and she cares. She cares about her clients. Specifically, she cares about our family and she cared that we find a safe location fit for our lifestyle. We found many homes we loved, but Lisa helped guide us to a location that best suited us. With us living out of state during the house hunting process we needed a realtor to get to know us and go that extra mile. We did not know the area and we had no idea where was safe and where in Las Vegas would suite our needs as a family. Lisa got to know us. She wanted to find us our perfect place.

We are now happy and we are now home owners. More than just handing us our dream home, Lisa has gone above and beyond for us. We are currently still out of state, and have needed help with putting final touches into the home buying process and she surpassed what her job description would entail. No need for fine details...but I can assure that she has done more for us than what any other realtor would ever dream of doing. We have been blessed. Lisa found us our perfect home in one try. The home we purchased was the only home we saw in person when we came to Las Vegas to house hunt. She got it. She got US. We took it. This was our first home buying experience. We could not have asked for a greater one. We feel absolutely blessed that Lisa was introduced into our lives as our realtor and now friend.

We hope that this testimony can give any sort of insight as to who Lisa is and how much she cares for her clients. We are more than pleased and extremely blessed.

1809,3,1548201600000,"Like most children who were raised by native Portuguese parents can attest to - our dietary upbringing traditionally consisted of staple food items including fresh paposecos, queijo São Jorge, sumol and pasteis de nata. 

Pasteis de nata were the host dessert of every family gathering. Tucked closely beside your Tia Maria's arroz doce that she swears is better than your Tia Conceicao's (who of course, is within ear shot), are these sweet, deliciously perfect egg tarts. You're glad everyone is too focused on the slew of insults being thrown at one Tia to another because this gives you *just* enough time to shove a tart into your mouth and run off with another in your hand before anyone notices.

Tia Maria and Tia Conceicao still aren't speaking to each other a decade later making family get-togethers a rare commodity, so now when you need to quell the hankering for pasteis de nata, you gotta find a bakery. 

Which brings us to Pombalense Bakery. Tucked in a seemingly inconspicuous plaza with a prime real estate spot in the corner, Pombalense is the answer to my craving when I have the time first thing in the morning to pop in to fill the void. 

Pombalense has that distinctly homey smell of fresh baked bread and espresso that greets you immediately when you step inside. To your right, is a coffee bar. In the middle is where a wrap-around counter hosts baked goods, a hot table, and the cash register. One side of the bakery is lined with bread racks, and a small fridge housing Sumol, Laranjada, Perrier, etcetera -  the other side, shelves full of Portuguese ingredient essentials. 

Whether you like them slightly burned, or light in colour, the pasteis de nata at Pombalense are typical of what you expect from any bakery - perfectly balanced, not too sweet, and definitely not too eggy. I'm 50% sure that most bakeries order them from the same supplier in Toronto, which guarantees some consistency. (And for the love of all that is good and right in the world, do not buy pasteis de nata from the grocery store; it's convenient, but it's not the same.)

This place is pretty quiet during the week first thing in the morning, but I can't speak to what it's like on a Sunday morning after church. 

Pombalense provides exactly what I expect from a Portuguese bakery - fresh bread, Portuguese pop, and these little tarts of heaven.",2
1815,3,1548892800000,"Great food.  We saw the write up in CP and went to give it a try.  It looks like they are mostly doing take-out, even though there are several tables to eat in.  We did take out but will probably eat in next time.

Very clean inside and staff was friendly.  We sampled most of the menu.  Ribs were fall off the bone and the sauce was very tasty (I did the mild).  The fried chicken wings were crisp and tasty, too.  We did Mac n cheese, baked beans, potato salad and collards and all were delicious.  My husband loved the corn bread muffins.

All in all, this place is legit and we will be sure to return.  Great addition to Brookline!",2
1817,3,1548288000000,"I imagine this place stays in business because is convenient for students and parents, since the schools are directly across the street. However, the presentation and delivery is very poor. 

We ate at the tables outside, so I expected trays, instead we got A bag. Individual bagS would have been perfect, because we could have used them to eat on. But they chose to THROW our whole order into one (small) bag! We had three orders! 2 veggie burgers, chicken strips and 3 orders of fries. And when I say throw, I mean throw....The chicken strips were on the bottom of the bag, the fries were not in a container- all 3 orders just dumped on top of the chicken strips- and the 2 burgers sat on top! We had to dig through the fries (which were not good), to get to the chicken strips... who does that??

The only reason I'm giving 2 stars, is because the veggie burgers were half-way decent (with the limited toppings offered).... or was I just hungry??

With the number of burger places around today, Char burger needs to start paying attention to the details that make a difference.",2
1819,1,1547942400000,"A great selection all around, and very reasonably priced. 

You can spend a good deal of time in here. Nicely organized, a lot arranged by color, you can approach the store in a few different ways. Sometimes it's ""I need a new blue dress"" or sometimes it's just ""I need a top"", maybe it's just ""I feel like buying something awesome""... any way the store caters to you. There is also a men's section, a children's section, kitchen/housewares, formal dresses, and plenty of jewelry, accessories, and shoes!

I usually don't find anything that is prices ridiculous high. I know I'm paying for better quality items than just any thrift store, and the prices reflect how ready to wear the items are, but that's about it. There is always the bargain trunk in the back!",2

The room itself was comfortable but the sheets were starchy. The bed was perfect, the hotel was quiet, and the breakfast was great. There was a huge selection of food and they did a great job of keeping it stocked. The only issue was that we couldn't bring our food back to the room while we got better.

In the end, we loved this hotel and we would totally stay here again in the future.",2
1841,3,1547596800000,"So my first experiences were fine. Despite a dental assistant bad nothing me when he thought i couldn't hear him.  Talking about me like i was stupid.  I'm not stupid,  just broke,  and 4 pregnancies have sucked the life out of my teeth.  I had a couple of extractions and a bridge with no issues.   Then i had a riot canal and crown done.  A couple of months later it got infected. I went in ad a walk in emergency.  They did an xray and the dr gave me antibiotics and a referral to an endodontist.  Hadn't had the time or money to get to the endodontist yet when the tooth gets infected ahain.  This time feels MUCH worse.  I called,  they said they couldn't call in antibiotics without seeing me.  I found a sitter, waited for a long while in the waiting room in agony.  When i was taken back the dental assistant (who in fairness was very nice) said the dentist i usually see want there.  The dentist on duty didn't come see me,  no xrays were taken. They wrote a prescription for antibiotics and ibuprofen and sent me packing.  I started it Monday is now Wednesday and i can barely speak without pain.  I Haven't slept since Saturday,  ibuprofen does nothing and I'm in tears by the end of the day. What kind of dental office sends someone home like that? Without even really checking them out? So my overall review is 2 because the first visits were fine.  But now that there's a problem it's like i don't exist.  I won't be enjoying thanksgiving with my family tomorrow.  Thanks risas. Guess we'll find out if you stand behind your 100%money back guarantee,  cause i didnt pay $2400 for a tour canal and crown to still be in this much pain on repeat and not be able to get any help.",2

1853,1,1548806400000,"This place is a classic ""don't be fooled by the outside"" place. Located across from CPCC in an unassuming strip mall with a tiny parking lot, this little gem is just waiting to make your date more interesting, your mouth do a little dance and your wallet skip a beat!

I always go for lunch here because it's $5.99-$6.99 for the same size portions as dinner (dinner is around $10-$12). I always get the spicy chicken dish and await the fun. 

To those who don't know (I didn't before I went here!), Ethiopian food doesn't come with utensils, instead it's plated on this spongy bread which you break off and use to pick up the food. It's amazing and like I mentioned above, a great place to take a date. Most people have probably never been to a place like this and it's an experience AND a meal which I like.

The meal comes on a large plate with the spongy bread and on top of it is a garden salad with a light Italian dressing, a pureed dish of some sort that's amazing, and the protein you've chosen with onions, spices and a sauce. Sometimes you'll get veggies and potatoes too, depending on what you order. I like it spicy and I always think they give a perfect amount of heat. Simple food that really speaks for itself is what you'll get here, but the portions are great so you'll never walk out hungry!

I've never tried dessert here, but I'd be willing to it if I ever had enough room left over! They do have soda in cans and beers in bottles. I believe this is a family owned place (husband/wife), as I have been going since I was 17 (I'm 24 now) and the wife has always been the waitress and is sometimes pregnant and sometimes not! :)

They offer their lunch specials...even on weekends, which was great.  All you can eat soup and salad bar comes with the lunch specials too!  I ordered the pad see ew with tofu, medium spicy, and the bf got the fried rice with tofu, hot.  Then we headed to the soup and salad bar.  The salad was not your typical iceberg lettuce, but a great mix of kale and cabbage, and maybe some lettuce too.  There were cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, red onion and green onions to add to your liking and a peanut dressing that was super yummy!  The soup was a vegetable soup that was broth with diced veggies in it.  I was barely 2 bites into my salad when our entrees arrived!  I snuck a taste of my noodles, before finishing my salad and soup, and then devoured my pad see ew.  It was just wonderful!  Perfect heat level for me, not oily and super flavorful!

He had his boat re upholstered and had nothing but great things to say about the quality of work and reasonable price. I couldn't agree with him more. The cushions turned out BEAUTIFUL. They were very helpful in picking out the perfect fabric. They came out just like the sample of the old ones being replaced. They were done in a very reasonable time. I couldn't be happier with how they turned out. I would highly recommend Mendoza to anyone in the search of any upholstery needs. Don't waste your time shopping around. Mendoza won't disappoint you.

1899,1,1547251200000,"I honestly have no idea how this place has a 4 star review. Though to be fair I've only been there once and perhaps it was just a really bad off-day for them. 

I work in the area and have tried most of the restaurants nearby, but have always avoided Loving Hut just based on the hideous signage and the menu. One day I decided to go for lunch because I have been wrong about places before that appear ""bad"" and thought this might be the case as well - nope. 

I do have to commend them for their service. The staff was super nice and welcoming and always checking in to ensure we were satisfied, but that's about the only plus I can give them. 

The food is just horrible. There are a lot of Asian dishes on the menu and honestly they were just plain bad. Like, worse than Manchu Wok bad. I can tolerate Manchu Wok - I absolutely cannot recommend the food here. 

If you like bad food/can't tell the difference then by all means support this business - they have a lot of heart. But if you care, or have working tastebuds, just do yourself a favour and go to Chinatown or something.",1

I ran in today to get some last minute ingredients for Rosh Hashonah dinner, and I was in and out pretty quickly.  They don't have the best selection when it comes to muffin mixes, so I had to go to Safeway for that, but other than that, Sunflower rocks!

1936,1,1547251200000,"Terrible customer service all around.

I just moved and needed a new washer and dryer for my new house. Lowes had a nice looking pair on sale for Memorial Day with high reviews and according to the website only this one particular Lowes in Ocotillio had them in stock. According to the website they had 10.

I arrived to Lowes and proceeded to appliance department. Could not find anyone around to help me and I could not find the washer/dryer pair that was in the ad. Finally another employee had the appliance person paged and he came over. I told him what pair I was looking for and he said no they never have that model in stock and don't even carry them. He said the website is wrong and was showing the warehouse inventory back east.

He seemed to have a pretty bad attitude and just said O Well. He didn't seem to enjoy his job very much. 

I then spent then next hour and a half looking at almost every pair they had on the floor and almost every single one was not available. Why have washer and dryers on the floor if you don't have inventory? 

Finally found a model they had available and arranged for delivery on Sunday between 4-5. 5:30 comes and the driver calls me and says he is running behind he will be there at 6pm. Well no washer and dryer at 6pm but another phone call at 6:45. Finally shows up at 7:30 and brings them in. However now he wont install them because the dryer vent has a 90 degree curve in it. Says its against company rules. This is the way the house was built and its this way from the home builder. 

You spend close to 2k on something you should get better customer service at the store and from the delivery drivers. Should have went to Home Depot.",2

Sure, they have fries, but why not order fries with bacon and cheese on them, plus ranch dressing on the side (You should, by the way - those are the pub fries and they are delicious). You could order a plain hot dog, but why do that when you have a choice of five different kinds of frank, and toppings like the Chihuahua: avocado, salsa, cheese and jalapeno? Plus, your dog (even if it's a turkey dog like mine) might arrive at the table with a little char on it; that to me is the peak of hot dog flavor.

I feel like a restaurant that serves cheese sauce like a food group should have a warning label on the door, but with their sense of humor, the label would say ""Warning: the food inside is damn delicious and best consumed with a great beer.""",2

I ordered the pita gyro. It was a little plain but I could work with it. I was hungry and ate it. I'll give that 2.5 stars. My coworkers ordered burgers and they looked like dry, frozen patties. None of them enjoyed the burgers. I also ordered a small side salad. It was basically iceberg lettuce with dressing. Plain and boring.

I've had both the thin and original crust, and I much prefer their thin (which is cut into Chicago squares, btw, while the original is slices).

I came for the afternoon tea and it was an excellent experience.  It costs about $26 but once in a while it is worth the splurge.

The waiter brings out a variety of teas at the beginning to allow you to sniff them and decide on which one you want.  They have a pretty good selection and it is hard to choose just one.  In the end I opted for something traditional like Earl Gray which hit the spot.

Foodwise they bring out a variety of traditional tea foods like finger sandwiches, scones and pastries.  The cucumber watercress sandwich was quite good and the scones were divine.  They were served still warm and had a fluffy interior but a crisp exterior.  Pastrywise the strawberry tart was pretty good.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the crust but the pastry cream and strawberries made up for it.  I also quite enjoyed the macarons.",2

These folks do a good job at emulating that sentiment.  

Otherwise, Dunkin is Dunkin.  As a corporation, they are doing a good job at branding and introducing relevant items within their market.  As a location, they are doing a good job at following through with the product.  The coffee is good and I was happy to see Egg Bagels in this town but I am still an eternal fan of the Boston Creme.

2024,2,1546905600000,"Time visited : Monday afternoon at 2pm. 
Atmosphere: modern-casual meets elegant. 
Cleanliness: tables and chairs/benches are kept clean. disposable chopsticks! 
Constructive criticism: The Wakami salad should be a larger portion, and the Salmon Sashimi should be cut larger too. I wish there was steamed egg on the menu. Their Bulgogi dish should have more beef. Their Sweet & Sour sauce is very sour and is definitely not the typical sauce you see at other Asian restaurants.
Cuisine: Japanese.
Facilities: I did not use their facilities. 
Food: All You Can Eat (AYCE) - Dinner Menu! I ordered 10pcs of Salmon Sashimi (good), 1 dish of Bulgogi (good flavor), 1 dish of Sweet & Sour chicken (dressing was too sour - rancid, but chicken was good), 2 pcs of Cheese Wonton (excellent), 1 Red Dragon Roll (great).
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: Will return, but not frequently due to distance from home. Will recommend to others because their food is tasty although is small portioned.
Parking: Private. 
Portion Sizes: small to fair. 
Price: fair to ok. I paid $28 with tip for one person dinner menu (because of the sashimi). Lunch for Adult $13.95 - Lunch for Senior $12.95, Lunch for Kids ages 7-10 $9.95, Lunch for Child ages 3-6 $5.95,  Dinner for adult $21.95, Dinner for Senior $19.95, Dinner for Kids ages 7-10 $14.95, Dinner for Child ages (3-6) $7.95.  Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays: Dinner (Adult) $22.95, Dinner (Senior) $20.95, dinner price for Kids and Children will remain the same
Service: I was immediately greeted when I walked in. I sat myself after given the option to select any open seat. Service is prompt, friendly. Not so knowledgeable of their own items available. Having to ask other servers what is inside their rolls.  
Selection: Wide variety. .

2042,1,1547078400000,"Holy mediocre food, Batman!

I usually wait about 24-48 hours before reviewing a restaurant, but I had to get this one in right away. 

Tonight was our second attempt eating here. The first time, we were laughed out of the joint because of our disbelief of a two hour table turn at 9pm on a Saturday night. Allow me to save you money and 2-3 hours of your life, DO NOT EAT HERE. Reasons are listed below. 

The margaritas are terrible. Really?  You want to charge me $8-$9 for a margarita from a plastic jug with close to bottom tier tequila?  I consider myself a margarita connoisseur. Charging anyone said amount of money for something that isn't made to order is a crime and an embarrassment. I couldn't taste anything that resembled an alcoholic drink due to all of the sugar. Thanks in advance for the hangover and stomachache tomorrow. The owner should be ashamed. 

Point two - you tell me there is a two hour wait for a table and then magically 3 open tables appear in twenty minutes. Joke.... Sounds like you are trying to make this place sound more in demand than it should be. 

Just to break up the negative - the goat cheese guacamole was pretty good. Chips, not so much. 

Tamale - this make me rage in anger typing this. After having this hyped up by the waiter, we got this as one of our entrees. Mistake number 25. We could have made this at home. The tamale portion of the meal was atrocious. Just because you throw a can of corn in the masa does not mean the tamale will come out moist and delicious. The tamale was crumbly and dry. The short rib on top had some good flavors. Too bad my wife and I both had to spit out chucks of fat into our napkins. Poor poor poor dish. If you are going to charge me $17 for something that cost $6 for you to make, it better be executed perfectly. 

Steak tacos - the steak was cooked well. I love hanger steak but I was not blown away. However this portion of the dinner was decent. Except for you serving me Mission brand tortillas that were heated in a microwave. At least throw them on a flat top if you aren't going to make them yourselves. Which you should be doing considering the prices on the menu. 
 
In general the sauces and salsas were all pretty good!

Rather than ordering another terrible margarita I opted for a Pacifico to close my meal. In all honesty, I've had better margaritas at a state fair. I thought about ordering a flight of margaritas, but then I saw all 8 of those come from plastic gallon jugs as well. 

Our waiter was decent until we got to the end of the meal. He threw us a sales pitch for us to visit, what I assume is their sister restaurant, SOHO for brunch. Pass. My wife then made a comment about a drink at a Michael Symon restaurant to which the waiter rebutted that Cleveland restaurants all do the ""Michael Symon"" thing, but he just gets all the credit.

Whatever. Won't be back. Maybe next time I'll hit up a Michael Symon joint rather than be a patron of a place trying to profit off the ""hipness"" of Ohio City, Cleveland.",2
2043,3,1547683200000,"I just moved to a new location in Scottsdale and found auto detective to be the closest to me at 7 miles away.  The hardest thing was getting an appointment, I just kept missing the techs call.  

Once I got over in the morning, I saw that it was smaller shop, but everyone there was in good spirit very friendly and I'm not a morning person. 

I brought my own part, and the tech told me that they couldn't warranty it.  Honestly I don't blame them, I had warranty from the manufacturer in any case for the part, but at least he was up front about it and they still installed it.  

The tech gave me a quote of 2 hrs to replace my front air strut on my X5.  And you know what, that's what the price was when he got done, no Frits, that's what it was. 

My air suspension has four corner leveling, it took about 30 minutes of driving and moving the suspension up and down. The computer was able to adjust leveling and my front end was level again. 

They did a great job, nothing was broke under the wheel well, and they gave me back my core part to send back to the manufacturer. 

I'm definitely taking my SUV back for any part or work It might need done.",2
2045,2,1548201600000,"I order ""large beef ribs"" to go (about $16)....which comes with two sides to be chosen from a list of sides that are listed on the menu at $1.99 each. 

I want sweet potato fries which is not on the list of sides that comes with the order and is listed on the menu at $2.99. 

So I do quick math in my head, and ask the barman if I can trade the two $1.99 sides for one $2.99 side. I figure with a net gain of $.99 to the house, it would be an easy call. The barman politely says 'can't do it.'

So I call one of the management staff over; his name is Rob. I tell him what I want to do. He says 'can't do it'. 

I point out it's a trade in his favor. He says 'still can't do it'. 

I say 'but you're going to have an unhappy customer'. He says again 'can't do it'.

I should have walked out then and there, but I was starving, so I took the order with the two ""fascist"" sides.

I can only assume by my experience that this restaurant doesn't want my business...and I am more than happy to oblige.

""More than happy to oblige""...those are five words the management at Adam's Ribs would do well to learn.",2

We came in for dinner and the food wasn't even Cracker Barrel quality it was cold but after a 8 hour drive we just ate it. I ordered a peach cobbler to go which was literally 4 peaches and a dime sized piece of crust. My husband went inside to ask a cashier was this a normal serving size and the cashier directed him to the manager. My husband asked the manager the same question and he said yes before my husband could get the question out then quickly turned away as if my husband was bothering him and was not the least bit apologetic. How rude! Then my husband requested to speak with the manager again because he didn't get the chance to really speak with him regarding the serving size of the peach cobbler. Needless to say the at that particular location the serving size for peach cobbler is barely enough for a toddler, which cost $4. This is more than likely the reason this locations food is less than edible because the staff has to work with such a sour apple for a boss. I can't imagine if he treats paying customers this way how is he treating his staff? So whoever you are Mr. Manager please take off your moon shoes and astronaut costume come back down to earth!",2

A problem that I had with Szechwan Palace in the past was that despite the price of around $10.00 for a plate (entrée) the portions were small and kind of stingy. But today, was very different. The portions were large and everyone at our table of 5 was able to eat with contentment from all five of our orders; the flavor was really good in my opinion. Rice here is free which is a must for a spicy place. 
Lastly, I'd like to say that I really enjoy ice water. Some places seem to be so stingy with their water. Today, four glasses. Awesome.

The variety on the menu is nice, and so are the prices. I suggest avoiding the bread/pastry items and instead get things that don't look like they could possibly be dry. Some of the non-pastries are very good. (And the pastries too... sometimes.)

With it being windy and cold there was no way that I was doing it myself so I thought I'd give this place a shot. I get there at 11 am this morning (Saturday) and there was no wait. After a quick look I did the $25 Wash and Detail, which included the console along with floors and such. 

After I got through the car wash I was immediately waived into an open bay for detailing/cleaning. The guy was super friendly (wish I had noticed his name) and grabbed all the trash out of my door when I mentioned that it needed throwing out. I went straight into the gas station to get some coffee and wait for them to work. 

I know it's their ""shtick"" but it was nice to have someone open the door when I got there. The people were super friendly and I have to say the coffee was REALLY good. I was impressed with how clean the gas station and bathrooms were as well. I'd have to say that I waited 10 minutes before they came in to get me. 

I was so pleased with the job they did on my car I told myself when I drove away I just had to write them a review. Seriously, that was the best $31 (wash + tip) that I've spent in awhile. I will definitely be making this  my go to spot when I need my car cleaned",2

To date, they are still the only place locally I have found that has a roll with raw jalapeno, one of my favorites in sushi. Honestly, they'd probably get knocked down a star if it weren't for that one delightfully spicy roll. 

I've not been for dollar sushi days on Monday, but it sounds like a great way to try new rolls. 

Their lunch buffet is pretty good. They have a limited amount of sushi and what they do have is pretty safe: california rolls/fried rolls. They also have curry and salad on the buffet. It's a little pricier at over $10/person, but the food is good. Definitely worth a shot if you're interested in checking out some safer food options. For me, I want all things spicy!

However, I don't think even the most tastebud-less of Geeks would really love these Gyros. They're more expensive than almost any in Cleveland, which is a city of very cheap Gyros and mini Gyros (most towns don't offer mini Gyros but the best places in Cleveland do, often for under $5). So already we got off on a bad foot considering I was charged closer to 10 than 5 for a Gyro.

But then the fact that I found the whole thing - bread sugary/store-bought/bland, veggies wilted, sauce bland like sour cream, and meat not particularly flavoured or tasty - to be one of the less good Gyros I've had anywhere. There was a really long wait for it too, and I was starving, so that's further damnation.

I'd recommend Best Gyros (both locations) out east, or Gyro World out West of Cleveland, for the very best in town. The one in West Side Market is not very good either. But I totally support family businesses so I'll give them 3 stars.",2

The cassava however was a guessing game. Some pieces tasted nice and crisp in the mouth while others gave the impression that they had been sitting around for a few days(dry, and not crispy) that is not to mention that the pieces I'm criticizing also lacked the heat of the freshly cooked pieces.",2

Most of our visits have been for breakfast and I've found it to be a solid breakfast option. Even at prime breakfast time on weekends we didn't have to wait long for a table if there was a wait at all. Service has always been friendly and efficient. Pricing for both breakfast and dinner is inexpensive.

My favorite part of the breakfast menu is the variety of options. They have pastries, fancy coffees, omelets, benedicts, crepes, pancakes, waffles, and quiches. I know I'll find something delicious no matter what food mood I'm in. It's also a favorite spot when my parents are in town.

1. The price for a bowl of soup and half sandwich is almost $12. This seems a little high for a lunch, regardless of being downtown or not
2. The croutons and cheese they give you for your soup (at least when you get it to go) are so oily. The cheese, all 4 pieces of shredded mozz where just not enjoyable. The croutons where limp and soggy and just caked in oil.

The soup itself (tomato basil) was really good. I normally don't like when my tomato soup is pink because it usually means it's going to be overly creamy, but this wasn't. It was very fresh tasting, and a good temperature.

The sandwich (turkey focaccia) was pretty decent. The turkey was sliced thick, so it almost tasted like it was from a real breast of a turkey they roasted that morning.

2356,1,1546992000000,"This is going to be a long review, because I want future potential customers to know what they're dealing with. I wish I had checked yelp prior to choosing them.
 Myself and my four children and a dog are on a two month road trip. Four days into our trip, I backed into a cement wall causing quite a bit of damage to my Toyota Sequoia. Lift gate was not accessible, but we trudged on with our access knowing I was going to get it fixed in Arizona. I don't live in the area, when I contacted my insurance company, they have a list of 5 star rated facilities, this was one of them. They're also a Toyota dealership, so all of their work is covered for the life of the vehicle. All good! 
 I take my vehicle in, letting the service rep know that I'm on somewhat of a timeline, and waiting 3 weeks for this job to be completed isn't an option, if they can't finish it, I will look elsewhere. She talks with her manager, explains the situation and lets me know that she thinks they can do it in a week. Should've known that was too good to be true. But honestly not finishing it within a week is fine, but as a professional company, please keep me informed for the timeline so we can plan on when to leave. Here's the thing, I was kept up to date via texts ALL WEEK LONG. Told that my vehicle was going to be done ON TIME, then 5 minutes before close on Friday night I get a message and text letting me know that it wasn't going to be finished till Wednesday. This was slightly over 12 hours before I was due to pick it up the next morning. The situation that had occurred was EASILY known prior to 5 minutes before close on A Friday, the day before I'm supposed to pick up my vehicle. Here's the real kicker though, due to the service rep not notifying me earlier a series of events had taken place that made this weekend one of the most stressful weekends of my life. I contacted her supervisor on Saturday, when she had told me she would be available to address any concerns, but wasn't. I told the supervisor what I needed done to my vehicle, why I was upset. He was all words. In the end, lied to me as well. I believe in integrity, lying to your customers is NOT okay. Hence the reason for 1 star versus 5. Know that they are NOT professional here AT ALL!

The attention to detail is fantastic. You feel like you are staying at a luxurious resort, but the price does not reflect that. They offer shuttle service to the strip, compliments of the resort. Give them a try and you will never stay elsewhere!",2
2471,2,1548028800000,"I've never been to Japan, however when I do finally make it there this is how I imagine the food will taste.  Everything that we ordered was SO delicious!  
The location of the restaurant has a lot of competition in such a small strip mall: Chubby Cattle, District One Kitchen, Chada Thai & Wine and Ramen Tatsu to name a few (all of which are bookmarked and I have yet to try).
My husband and I enjoyed the food so much that I did not even take pictures of what we got so I took pictures of the menu so I could remember what we ate.
It's awesome that you can try a little of everything instead of being committed to one big entree.  Portion sizes are decent and sushi was very fresh.
We tried a little of everything and ordered the following:
(We are not very adventurous and stayed away from ""exotic things"" ie: tongue, pork belly, intestine etc..) 
Sushi 
Passion Roll $11.50 Spicy tuna and cucumber inside and tuna on top were so fresh
**Natto Roll $3.50 (for me) if you do not know what this is then skip it.  It is fermented soy beans so healthy and good for you however it is an acquired taste and something that I have been eating since I was a little kid. Whenever I go to a Japanese or sushi restaurant I look to see if there is Natto.

Ikayaki $7.95 The squid is marinated in their signature ""Tare"" sauce and was prepared perfectly.
Dynamite $8.95 Baked scallop, crab, mushroom and onions baked in a mayonnaise? sauce, one of the best we've ever had!
Sukiyaki Hot Pot $7.65 The meat was not fatty and the broth was very tasty.  There was a lot of food 3 pieces of tofu, clear noodles, bok choy, enoki mushrooms, onions and green onions.
You can add rice and miso soup for $3.00
or rice, miso soup and California roll for $7.50
Cheese Chikuwa Tempura $4.65 I liked this one, my husband not so much.  It was a very interesting texture combination with the melted cheese, chewy fish cake and slight crisp outside from the tempura batter.

Yakitori-All Yakitori is cooked on Bincho-tan Charcoal that is imported from Japan so that they can make it as authentic as possible and also makes the food crispy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside.
Chicken Thigh Tare $2.25
Chicken Thigh with Citron Pepper $2.50-Hubby really liked this one, it had a good flavor but a little too spicy in a peppery way for me.
Shitake Butter $1.85
Okra $1.50

Dessert
Honey Toast I was very excited about this for dessert and almost didn't get it because I was so full from dinner, but I did and OMG it was the tallest piece of bread I have ever seen! It was so delicious! Bread, vanilla ice cream and honey! Very basic but so yummy and a MUST to top off your dinner, save room!
They also had a a pretty big selection of sake both hot and cold, by the bottle or carafe.

Overall we had a great dinner experience and will be telling everyone we know to go and check this place out!  We will be back again for sure!",2

My husband got the seafood mix, it had lobster tail, crab legs, potatoes, oysters, etc and he loved it. I stayed safe and got the Bistro burger, it was huge and delicious. I was pleasantly surprised by the side salad!  It was large portion and delicious...not just lettuce and croutons thrown in a bowl like most restaurants do. 

We will definitely be back for more!!",2
2482,2,1547424000000,"Clean rooms or at least the room that we got. We don't want to pay extra for the view so we got the lovely wall overlooking huge vents. It's nicely painted. I gave them one star because of the WiFi. WiFi is so cheap now that its readily available just about any modern hotel/city you go in the US. We connected our iPhones and sure enough we got connectivity, easy peasy. It's getting good signal most of the time we were using it. Got dropped many times but hey at least they offered. Laptops connections isn't as lucky as a smartphone. So I called front desk to find out why. I got transferred to technical support. I waited and waited. Counted all the wall stripes around the room. But since my family is resting at the time I called I have lots of time to burn. an hour and fifteen minutes later still no pickup. I gave up. No internet on laptop no great customer support is a deal breaker for me. And a one star is in order. Otherwise if this is something you don't really care about, then by all means come and chk them out. Nice clean facility. Casino smells cigarettes as expected but hey you are in Vegas don't be like that. 

Pool is great. Whether technical issues happens everyday there's no way I will know that. But given a short stay that we did it is important to us. I will try other hotels next time. Sure we did not come to Vegas to check internet but hey most of us do like to browse wherever we go. Cheers and check this hotel out. It's just not for me.



-thx for the reply.
-we will try again September",1

The ambiance was nice. The building itself looks pretty cool. 

Service was good. The bartender and cocktails were awesome. Id say some of the best cocktails ive ever had. 

Food. Also good. Solid. I had the pork ramen - something ive been craving - and it didnt disappoint. Only thing i think could have bee better was the meat cut to be a little less 'tough' i guess. Also had the pork face dumplinga - excellent. And the grilled octopus - also tasty.

2498,2,1546387200000,"I went here with a couple of friends on April 4 for dinner.  We were excited to try this new place out as we work nearby.  The different sushi rolls were just ok, the torched sushi is just ok as well.  The menu is small considering the $34.99 price tag  None of the ""specialty"" sushi rolls really blew me away.  The kitchen food such as beef cubes and garlic shrimps seemed like it was pre-cooked and just plated as it was ordered.  The beef cubes were really dry and the shrimp was under cooked.  Orders were placed via writing down on a piece of paper which could lead to reading errors.  We got food we didn't order and didn't get the food we did order.  

I really wanted this new sushi place to be good.  It replaced another sushi restaurant called Sushi Queen which was mediocre at best.  Unfortunately, I will not be going back to Kaka; considering the food, experience and cost, it is not worth going unless you just want to experience it one time.

Good luck Kaka, I wish you the best.",2

The ice cream wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to what we were expecting.  It wasn't creamy and actually had a more icy taste.  Flavors are okay, but nothing exciting.  It was average ice cream, and not worth the money. Needless to say, we will be saving our weekend ice cream trips for somewhere else.",2

2531,1,1546387200000,"I am glad that my husband and I found this place for pet grooming. See Spot Clean exceeded our standards of what good customer service is as well as performance. I have taken my boy Atreyu to well-known chain pet stores to get his grooming and the service and performance were okay, but this place went above and beyond. This was my girl Bella's first time, and we were worried that she would be too excited and bark a lot at the other dogs since she hasn't been around other dogs in a long time even though she gets along well with them. But as soon as we entered there, it was a warm and calm environment because neither of my babies were barking or excited. We got the bath and brush service done on them both and the work done on them was thorough. Usually when I took Atreyu to the other chain pet stores, they would always leave some hair on him and when they blow dried his hair, they did not brush his hair while it was getting dried. When we brought them home from See Spot Clean, they both smelled so good that their scents would linger in the rooms and hallway. At home, they were smiling, like literally smiling, and were so relaxed, similar to when I would come home relaxed after being in a spa. We don't know what else they did there at See Spot Clean, but whatever they did, keep up the great work. My husband and I never seen our dogs this happy before. Also, we noticed that the other dogs in the waiting area were very happy. They did not bark at us and they were smiling, as silly as it sounds. As far as prices, they were very reasonable, we found them to be cheaper than the ones we got charged at the chain pet stores. We also loved the complimentary bandanas on them. They looked so adorable. Definitely going back! :)",2

2542,1,1546387200000,"I found this business to be extremely pricey and very dishonest. They charged me $130 for a belt that cost them $29.99. My total bill was $200 when it should have only been $80 (this includes labor). After the repair was completed the manager told me that I needed to have another part replaced. When I acquired as to the cost of the procedure, he told me that it would be between $200 and $500 (including labor). After doing some checking around, I discovered that most mechanics would charge me between $80 and $100 for that same procedure. When I questioned the manager about my bill he became  irritated and defensive. He told me that he charged more for the belt, because all products and services come with a lifetime warranty. Yet, when I looked at the bottom of my billing statement it reads, ""Warranty on parts and labor is 90 DAYS unless otherwise specified. Warranty work has to be performed in our shop & cannot exceed the original cost of the repair..."" (Is it just me, or does something smell fishy here?)

How often do you purchase an item and/or service in which the cost of the warranty exceeds the price of the original item. (Let alone 3 times the  cost of the item!!!) 

Do yourself a favor and find another mechanic!",1

I thought the food was okay, not bad, but I wouldn't necessarily return for the dishes I tried. The chicken skins were the favorite at the table. The hot chicken just wasn't as crispy as I hoped and I think it needed a little more heat. The beef short rib itself was good, but the fonduta with it didn't work for me.

2588,1,1546992000000,"Bannock refers to the flatbread which forms the basis of most of the dishes, it's a versatile bit of stodge used for pizza bases, burger buns and sandwich bread, but honestly it's what goes on and inside them that's really good.

As a party of four we were able to order a variety of dishes and the portion sizes meant that we all got to try a decent amount of everything.  

We shared a couple of starters - the best being salt cod donuts with double smoked bacon lardons, but the split pea fritters were also good, like nuttier felafel with a great texture.

For mains we couldn't not order the roast duck poutine pizza, which did exactly what it said on the menu. A gargantuan stack of chips, gravy, curds and duck on a flatbread. Nothing too exciting, but delicious nonetheless.  More interesting was the pulled pork and macaroni quesadillas - unsurprisingly it turns out that this carb on carb combination is great.  To me the best main was the meatloaf; moist and succulent loaf, topped with baked grapes and placed upon a bed of mixed whole grains - together the meaty, earthy and fruity flavours made this the most interesting dish.

Our desserts were good - a butter tart and a s'mores cake (a chocolate brownie topped with toasted marshmallow) - but not terribly exciting. To be honest, by the time we'd polished off the mains I was amazed we even tried to tackle them...

Service was very friendly and good food advice was given - staff seemed very jolly and happy to assist when required.  Decor was pleasant, modern and airy - a nice place for small groups, but less good for an intimate dinner.

It's nice to finally see a restaurant that manages to do Canadian comfort food the service that it deserves. It's not fine dining and it's not a diner, it's souped up crowd pleasing dishes with some delicious innovative twists at a great price - heartily recommended,",2

Our waiter took 10 minutes to ask us what we would like to drink. When we were ready to order, we had to wait another 10 minutes before we could get his attention. The waiter didn't know which menu items the restaurant was out of. He came more than 15 minutes after we placed our order to let us know that they were out of one of the things we ordered. It took 40 minutes for us to get our food and some of our dishes were cold. On the positive side of things, at least the portions were large and the overall price was great. While waiting for our meals, we also had the most unfortunate circumstance of finding a disgusting piece of brown ""turd"" on the table. This begs to question if the tables were even cleaned properly prior to us being seated. We were appalled when we weren't invited to the ""ruffian"" poker game that took place in the basement of the vicinity. One can make the assumption that ""waiting"" is the theme of the restaurant; we sure experienced an abundance of it! Our waiter didn't even have the decency to ask us once how our meals were. He also disappeared for what seemed like an eternity as we were waiting to get receive our bills.. Ugh. (He was probably stuck playing a round of poker downstairs.) In addition to this abhorrent experience, we also received a lecture at the end of the meal for asking ""too late"" for our bills to be split. Perfect end to a ""perfect"" night. Royal Flush.",2

The tortilla was REALLY good, a little light on bacon, potato could have used another minute or two of the grill. Cheese and egg were right. The place wasn't ""filthy"" as some have reported. It was old, just old, not dirty. Tables and counters are very worn! It looks like someone started a biz on a low budget and are making due with what they have. I can't get mad at that!

They have zero cocktail service for starters.  They don't accept comps for drinks either. They reduced the slot game space to put in a night club.

We complained to the pit boss about the cocktail service. She apologized and said we were not the first to complain.  The next day we talked to Sal the assistant manager who was upset that the pit boss told us to complain to him.  The end result was a complaint form that we could fill out.

I ventured out and got lunch today. Worst choice all day. I got chicken tenders. Disgusting. They were so over cooked and the texture was that of a fried fish. I honestly could not eat it if I tried. Personally I will not come here again. It's overrated with the local people as a ""staple"".",2

Overall a good dinner but expect more for the price.",2
2664,1,1546732800000,Personally if I am shopping somewhere as high end as Saks Fifth Avenue where they cater to a higher end clientele I think I deserve good customer service. I came by here today to return a shirt that I had bought recently and received major attitude by the gentleman who helped me. He treated me as though I was an inconvenience to him. I then proceeded to go upstairs to purchase some jeans and the sales guy was rude and made me feel the same way! Horrible and seriously unacceptable and I don't plan on shopping here in the future and you shouldn't either.,2

Looking for a place for dinner at almost 9pm. First we thought Japanese, but I'm sorry to say that after being seated for ten minutes and not being offered a drink we got up and left, then we say Osteria Costa. Although we love Italian food, we normally don't eat it out, preferring to try food we don't cook so much at home. 
What a delight Osteria Costa is! Firstly, all the staff were extremely attentive and friendly - we didn't wait more than 30 seconds before we had water and menus. Jen, our lovely waitress brought us some delicious (although a little expensive ) wine selections & explained the menu to us.
We decided to share appetizer, salad, entree & dessert 'family style'. Everything was delicious, from the creamy burrata, the crusty bread, garlicky pesto, shaved Parmesan on the arugula salad to the perfectly prepared Branzino. And not a bone in sight on the whole fish dish. We topped it off with the 'famous' olive oil cake - which was so good, not too sweet an end to a fantastically fine meal - Italian done right (not a red sauce in sight) - I'm making that olive oil cake this weekend!! Thank you",1
2705,3,1547683200000,"I've been wanting to go to Gio Rana's Really Really Nice Restaurant (aka: the nose) for a long time now and finally made it tonight.

It didn't disappoint. I started with my classic 'lychee martini' I have this everywhere I go :P and then followed up with one of their fun cocktails (sexy mofo). Drinks were pretty good. 

The food was great! They have a fantastically tasty selection of 'contourni' or side dishes. My favs were the green beans with mint and garlic and the asparagus with gorgonzola. The rapini with garlic and lemon is worth ordering too. 

For my main, I had the garlic shrimp with crispy parmesan risotto cake - it was really flavorful but my only complaint was that the portion was pretty small (as is the case in many places when you order shrimp as a main dish).  There were lots of other things on the menu at looked good so i will definitely go back and try them. 

For desert I had the chocolate raspberry tartufo which was one of the best I've ever had. 

I've read some of the other review and many people say they had bad service but our service was really good. Our waitress was attentive, friendly and spent a fair but if time talking to us after we paid.

Overall, costs were mid range but worth it from my perspective. Two of us ate for about $50 each which included a couple of drinks, sides, main dishes and desert.",2

But the manager was very nice and took the salmon dish off from the bill after we told him how we felt about it.",1
2717,3,1547510400000,"We are visiting vegas for the evening and had some time to kill for a sit down dinner. 
We are from out of state and HATE the business of the strip and casino restaurants. This place was easy to get to and had plenty of parking. A serious plus in our book!
We were seated and immediately brought our drinks. The waiter took around 10 minutes to make it around to our table but my food came out within 5 minutes of ordering!! So quick!

I ordered the gyoza which came with a delicious dipping sauce. I wasn't hungry enough for the AYCE menu so I just got one roll. I chose the yum yum roll which was delicious! Super light and fresh. I ate the whole roll and appetizer and felt very satisfied. 

My husband however was starving and chose the all you can eat option which was very reasonably priced at $26.95. (Each roll averages to about $11 dollars so this option made sense) 
His order took a little longer to make, I had finished my whole meal before he got his. It would have been nice to maybe have at least one roll of his brought out with mine. 
He chose the TNT, caterpillar, and the vegas lasagna roll. 

The service was great overall, our waiter was attentive and checked back to let my husband know his rolls would be out soon. Sure enough they were brought within 3 minutes.  

The atmosphere is laid back and casual. We appreciated this after a long day of driving. 

The price point was good; the AYCE made up for the lack of the ""half price sushi"" option. The restaurant was pretty spacious so it wasn't too loud. LOTS of booths. 

All in all it was a perfect stop on our way through the city. Will definitely recommend and return!",2
2718,2,1547164800000,"Where to start?  I think this Havana Cafe is having an identity crisis.  It's in a teeny little upscale-looking strip mall. But the snotty kind of upscale, not the REAL upscale that will treat you like a king even if you're driving a hoopty and dressed in rags.  The vibe that you get from the surrounding businesses is more unfriendly than I am used to.  Let me explain a bit.  There is almost no parking, but if you find a spot, it has a marker on it identifying it as belonging ONLY to a certain business.  REALLY?  There are, in effect, about 7 spots, and y'alll want to be stingy in his economy and deter business from your next door neighbor?   I don't like that.

 Back to Havana Cafe.   If I were to give my opinion, they should try for a less upscale and more cozy attitude. What they have going now is not working for me.
The entrance is rough and bumpy and leads you through the patio to the front door.  I think this could be used to their advantage to ""invite"" people into a cozy and rustic dining experience. Not what they've done.  Black plastic patio furniture with black checkered plastic tablecloths?  Yuck.  Lace curtains on the windows of the restaurant?  Yuck.
Now we're inside.  The walls are covered in a bunch of posters, prints, ads, etc.  that have a cuban theme.  It's not designed, it's not thought out, it's not even inviting. It's chaotic and unpleasant.  The chairs are the same black plastic patio furniture, The tablecloths are circa 1980 tropical covered in glass like your grandmas dresser.

After getting a load of this, the food had better be STELLAR!  well.....
We started with a couple of iced coffees.  $9 for two glasses of mostly ice.  Throughout the meal, our server kept trying to get us to order more.  At $4.50 a pop?  Back off lady!!!
Food:
We ordered the Frituras de Frijoles Negros,and the Papa Rellano.  The little black bean balls were very freshly fried.  It pretty much goes downhill from here.  For $6 you get TWO balls of papa rellano that are sour and bland at the same time. How they managed that, I have NO IDEA at all.  After tasting these two appetizers, we decided against entrees and ordered the Tapas Trio. Warning, it keeps getting worse here.  
The one single. lonely, little empanada was sour and microwaved.  The single, thin, slice of Tortilla Espanola was cold and the Sherry sauce was raw.  As in uncooked and alcoholic.  The (3 tiny) albondigas were ok.  the sauce was straight out of a jar, Heinz Mushroom gravy---and COLD.
At the end of this travesty, they provide you with a SURVEY!!!!! As if you're in Chilis!!!  It says on the survey to drop it in the box by the door.  I would have done so, if there really HAD been a box by the door.  All you see by the door are the signs telling people that they can't wear tank tops.  In Arizona? Wow.  I'm serious, Havana Cafe needs to decide what they want to be, because what they are, is....TERRIBLE.",2

The veal was white with a succulent melt in your mouth appeal that had flavor bursting through the entire thing. The pork tenderloin was incredible as well if you enjoy spicy.  We ordered the side of baby carrots as an appetizer and were boggled by how simple baby carrots could contain so much flavor.  The service was quick and spot on.  My only complaint was the ""signature margaritas"" were piss poor and I could not even finish mine because it was giving me heart burn...and I LOVE Margaritas.",2

Because of your crappy service it forced me to take a taxi for $35 and you refund me $6.50.  Gee thanks for nothing.  

Avoid at all costs.",2
2756,1,1548806400000,"I live in Phoenix, but heard about this place in Vegas. I was told I had to check it out and so I certainly made plans to when my buddy showed up for a visit. The truth is that yelp doesn't let us do a half star, otherwise this place would certainly be 4.5!

Firstly, we walked in and the place was packed. It became evident that everyone knew each other there. Looking around there were two open seats, neither next to each other. We were helped with our cigar selection and proceeded to smoke the sticks.

As we went on, we were quickly accepted into the group, on this occasion I was rooting for KU in March madness and found a few friends. As I was there longer, it became evident that some people knew each other very well, others may have been the first time. I left with the perception that if someone had walked in, they would have assumed I was a regular by the way we were accepted.

Here's the breakdown:
Atmosphere: A humidor is broadly in view towards the middle of the building. To the left is a hallway that leads to a fridge stocked with sodas and waters. A couple of walls are painted over cinder bricks. Several TV's are in the smoking room, which is filled in with comfortably worn in seating. Near each seat is an ash tray for folks to rest their sticks. 5 Stars.

Staff: Friendly and accomodating. The staff here are very friendly and certainly make you their first priority. Even more so, this is the kind of place that you go into and inevitably find yourself in a conversation with the neighbor next to you, or with someone across the room. Very Cheers like there! 5 Stars.

Selection: When I was there, there were plenty of shelves for cigars to be located, however, there weren't that many selections represented. A lot of barren space was there. They may have been letting the shelves rest, but it was a let down. The plus side is that they did have several cigars that I haven't seen or tried, which was a plus. 
A side note, you can purchase a drink from them, sodas for 50 cents or water. The fridge carries a limited selection from what I saw, and it was Dr. Pepper, Water, or Diet Coke. 
This is where the .5 comes in. A mild selection with space for more, but a lot of houses I hadn't tried. Also if there were more beverage selections, I may have missed where they are located. The most visual place was a minor selection. 4 stars.

So, would I recommend this to a friend? Absolutely. If you are in downtown Scottsdale and looking for a smoke, Ford on Fifth is an excellent place to visit. Its a bit of a drive, but if I were in the area, I wouldn't hesitate to visit here again!",3
2759,1,1548115200000,"Sun Country is refreshing change from all the scam companies out there. I called them for a second opinion after a bad experience with another company (Larson). They came the same day, which was amazing, and they provide second opinions free of charge! Yes, free provided you have a written quote from the other company. How amazing is that??

Turns out the repair I needed was no where near as urgent or expensive as made out to be Larson.  The tech was also super friendly and helpful, unlike other said company. When the time comes, Sun Country is definitely getting ALL my business for any repairs or maintenance needed. These guys are great!

Bone in ribeyes with spinach was excellent but maybe too much.  Could have split the steak leaving room for the butter cake dessert.  Also the bread is incredible.   For wine add the Stags petite syrah.  And they were generous with the wine.  Only downside was tables for two are limited and we were a twosome.

I started with the carrot and curry soup which was warm and inviting...the spices and flavor came pleasured my palate with a subtleness that was both relaxing and reassuring....I was sure everything was going to be fine...a wonderful trait to find in a vegetarian soup. 
As ""Dont you want me"" by The Human League played I tried the Armadillo Eggs and Plantain nachos and never looked back.

We walked into the outdoor patio area- there was a sign that said to seat yourself. I walked by a waitress and asked her if it was ok to sit at a two-top and get a high chair for my son. She said sure. About 15 mins later, we still didn't have a high chair or menus. The same girl walked by and said sorry, she would be right out with water. I said that I'd really like some menus and a high chair for my son. 

She said sorry Your server will be right out--I was kinda surprised because this whole time I thought she was my server. So a couple mins later, my real sever came out to introduce herself. I told her that she's lucky my son is so good because if he wasn't I would have been losing it. I ordered him food right away- Mac and cheese, sweet potato fries, all very good. I ordered calamari for me, which was also very good. My waitress was very nice. She apologized for the delay and mentioned that they didn't have a hostess.

The wine was served in tiny Champaign glasses.  Very strange.  And this is the only Indian restaurant that doesn't serve Indian beer.  You can order Modelo but not Taj Mahal.

2823,1,1547510400000,"Our service started out okay when we were the only patrons on the patio, but slowly dipped as soon as more people arrived (on a 7 table patio). 

Our waiter was impatient from our first order and we sat between the clearing of our appetizer plates from even ordering our entree for a good 10 minutes. 

After ordering our entrees, 5 minutes tops, I asked if I could change my pasta option for my entree and was told he would check, 10 minutes later he came back and said no can do. I'm very familiar with the restaurant business so this alone would not have been a count against the service but was still surprised how long it took him to check. 

Our entree came and my daughter asked for more bread, he nodded and we waited for bread for the entire time. No mention that there was a table limit or he couldn't do it. We waited with our finished entrees for a good 15 minutes (no sight of the waiter despite a now filled patio) had to wave him down and then waited another 5 minutes at least. When he came with the check he cleaned our table with a dirty rag left the rag there and tended to another table and then came back to us to take care of our bill, leaving the dirty rag the entire time. As we were walking out we saw the manager, who had come out multiples times seeing impatient tables and did nothing, and told him our service was poor. He said it must have been a mistake and our server was the best they had, no apology and basically shooed us out and told us he didn't care.

2842,3,1546646400000,"Les torchés is a small cosy bar we ended up visiting because it was confirmed they will show the Habs game. Indeed the game was on on multiple screens and we got a complimentary bottle of beer as token for good luck. I wish that nice touch from the owners worked in Habs favor, but hélas! 

Back to our time in the pub, it was fun. People kept coming and our table for eight accommodated 13 somehow. So if you want to come with big crowd for drinks the size of Les torchés is not an issue. The noise level will allow for limited communication, but this is to be expected, The list of drinks is not an issue either, lots to choose from. The Bloody Caesar was uneventful. That was well compensated by my bacon bamboo sticks: candied bacon in spicy sauce, so hot that it will help you consume a pint of beer, bot soooo good. The small plates menu is really nice, my friends were happy with the tacos and chicken wings. Considering the amount of bars in the area I'm not sure when I will go back to this bar, but it is on my list for places to have a drink when I'm thirsty...!",2

Food was not well prepared (celery was frozen and look like it had been through a garbage disposal, fries were limp and greasy). Obvious flaws that no one in the kitchen caught or cared to correct. Everything is over salted, apparently to hide the lack of flavor. Just glad I didn't order anything from the higher priced side of the menu. I do complement the waiter, who was good to check in with us and brought replacement food, but it just galls me to pay those prices and have a kitchen operating with no adult supervision.

2884,3,1548892800000,"Got there at 6:50pm with a party of 3 and was given an all you can eat menu, when our server finally came to our table at 7:10pm i was told i was not allowed to do the all you could eat because it was now after 7. I told her i was given the menu so why couldnt i do it? She seemed busy and a little irritated but agreed to let me do it and we were definitely rushed on ordering. (Might I add I have been sick for the past two days and havent eaten anything so needless to say i was STARVING!) Back to the being rushed part, we ordered hot sake for the 3 of us and one of my friends ordered a sopporo (which he couldnt get out that he wanted a large because she was already walking away) we couldnt even ask for water. We didnt get water until the end when i asked for it.

When it came to ordering she told me to check off everything i wanted on the all you can eat menu (which usually i order as i go as not to order too much...) so i did exactly as she told me to do. When she picked up my paper she make the comment, ""thats A LOT of food. Remember no sharing and no left overs."" Im sorry, you are rushing me and you dont know how much food i can put down number one, number two...you dont know how much money i have so if i end up sharing then charge me for it! No need to explain the rules to me or make a rude comment! I was really put off. I understand being busy and feeling rushed, i work at a restaurant where i have 6 tables at a time and believe me even in extreme circumstances i would never make a comment like that to my guests who are leaving me tips. Might i add the two friends i had with me also work at the same restaurant aforementioned. 

ANYWAYS. The food took a look time to hit the table but once it did it was pretty good. I've had better but i've had worse. I think if the server hadnt have rushed us and seemed annoyed for no reason the whole experience would have been better. I was the only person who left her a decent tip since the other two people didnt feel she deserved it. She seems like a nice lady and i understand (again) about being busy but it can really make or break your experience. I probably wont come back here.

For starters we shared raw clams (my first time having clams raw) and the fois gras. Wow. The clams were so fresh! Not a grain of sand to interrupt the creamy deliciousness. And the fois gras was so rich and delicate at the same time. So far we were all happy. The waitress kindly recommended a lovely bottle of wine which paired perfectly with the starters

We each ordered something different for entrees and each was better than the next. The roasted chicken was tender and juicy with a lovely light gravy. The steak fritz was perfectly cooked medium rare - one hardly needed to chew! Then the moule fritz just smelled amazing and tasted even better. Finally the trout was so delicate and flakey - perfectly seasoned to highlight the fish and the haricot verts. Wow. What perfection

The service was just right - no water or wine  glass went empty, and our waitress provided advice with selecting a wine that would pair with all the foods. An excellent dining experience.",2

My friends and I got a great circular booth in the corner after waiting only 10 minutes for a table. I ordered the tuna steak which I thought should have been a little more spicy and lacked some taste. The polenta which was on the bottom of the bowl was delicious and mixed well with the sauce and other tastes. My friends' pork tenderloin apparently was awesome so I guess I missed out here. One problem we had with the service was that our waiter specifically said our food would be out in 3 minutes. Well, we thought that was specific enough that it would probably be exact. But we waited over 10 minutes before it actually came out. That was kind of annoying.

2920,2,1548806400000,"I ate Dirty Food Catering's food at The Victoria Day Brewer's Backyard beer festival at The Brickworks.

Their sign described them as: ""Pop-Up, Private Event Caterers, Junction Restaurant Location.  Gourmet Comfort Food Done Right.""

They had more reasonable prices, but were not selling out of food as quickly as the other food trucks and food vendors.

DF offered a choice of, and I quote:

1) ""DF Burger - Ground chuck & pork pattie, garlic aioli, Skinny Dippin' stout beer BQ sauce, Cheese, Pickle, & Lettuce $7.00""

2) ""DF Pierogi - Hand rolled cheesy potato stuffed peirogy, smoked sour cream, caramelized onions, braised cabbage $6""

3) ""Soda Pop (Various) $1.00""

The burger was simple, yet delicious, HOWEVER, (and it's a BIG however) it was still mooing.  I have NEVER been served a burger from a professional kitchen that was THAT undercooked.  It was actually cool in the center or what I would call blue rare if it was a steak.  SEE PHOTOS.  I don't mind a bit of pink in the centre, but this was really raw ---- which is especially concerning considering food spends more time out of the fridge being transported to a hot, outdoor, summer event.  In those situations, I'd prefer ground meat to be fully cooked like the health inspector requires.  Though it was positioned as a family event, I would not have fed a burger that undercooked to a child and really questioned eating it myself.

I do appreciate their friendliness and creativity in the names of items and ingredients, like smoked sour cream.  So I gave them an extra star.

I hope they will pay more attention to details because otherwise I fear the word ""dirty"" in their business name, Dirty Food, will tend to infer unsanitary rather than messy comfort food.",2

Trin Bellwoods is a hipster haven on steroids. Bocce ball, leash-less dog park, lots of picnic tables and bike paths. It's often taken over with people doing those weird tightrope walking stunts between trees and playing croquet. They're my least fave people in the park, but that's my issue, not yours.

I have heard their commercials before and I have been wanting to check the place out. I am a huge fan of Chipotle and due to everyone's reviews that this restaurant is of a similar concept, it was my idea to go there. 

Once there, there were only two young girls behind the counter, no one else in the restaurant. Because I had never been there, I was looking over their menu. The girl however, seemed in a rush to get my order done so she could go back to talking to her co worker. As I was going through the line I was asking for recommendations on what she thought went best together but again, she seemed bother to help me and had a bad attitude. She kept making comments on the fact they didn't charge extra for guacamole and I figured it was their job to sell you on that. Also, the food behind the counter seemed like it was sitting there all day and did not look appetizing at all. There was trash on the floor of the restaurant and there was even chairs on top of the tables. For a restaurant that didn't seem busy at all I would expect cleanliness. 

I ended up paying $11.00 for a bowl that seemed smaller than the bowls at chipotle that I would normally spend $9.00 for even with the extra guacamole. The worst part of my experience is that both  my room mate and I ended up getting food poisoning even though we ordered two completely different things. I literally rushed home to throw up because their food was so heavy on me. I automatically knew that it was from there because I had not eaten anything all day before that. 

I definitely do not recommend this place at all. I am going to stick with Chipotle all the way. My first experience with this restaurant will be the only one. Their  staff need to change their attitude as well.",2

You had to hunt for ones with meat, and most of them had just the thinnest strips of it left.  I'd feel better about eating at hometown buffet or McDonald's.  Service was... Odd.

Their milk tea coffee is amazing. I've also had their French toast squares which are pretty good if your in the mood for sweets. Over all it's a good value for the food you get.

They are all over the news & is one of the top Las Vegas restaurants.  In Sài Gòn (Viet Nam),  District 1 is where all the actions are, and features some of the best cuisines of the country.  This D1 restaurant represents well what Sài Gòn has to offer; really brought us close to home!

They feature some of the most authentic Vietnamese dishes with a twist in style or presentation.  They are comfort foods that you come in not necessarily because you are hungry, but because you crave some of the dishes that mom & grandma haven't cooked in awhile.

This joint is owned & operated by my friend, Chef Khai Vu.  I tell ya what, I am really glad that I loved everything that I ate there, so now I can wholeheartedly endorse this restaurant & truthfully feel great about backing it! By the way, neither Chef Khai Vu nor his wife ask me to write any of this.  In fact, they have no idea I am writing this review.

I changed rooms 3 times to try and get a room that was slightly less noisy, but was never successful.  Their elevators and general maintenance of the facilities are very poor - it was nearly impossible to sleep with the constant noise of machinery going all night long (very thin walls + elevator counterweights that are constantly hitting the rails = LOTS of noise).  The bathrooms and sink areas were freakishly small and difficult to navigate.  You can just feel they were trying to stuff as many people in the rooms as possible, regardless of comfort.  They are also woefully understaffed - I sat on hold, multiple nights, for more than 15 min just to try and schedule a wake-up call.   I'm giving it an additional star (rather than just 1), because the dealers on the casino side were very friendly and engaging and the food selection was quite nice (from the $100+ per-person steakhouse to a 24-hour subway).

We knew it would be a big job since the previous owner put a textured stucco on the outside of the house and the front sun room. The previous owner also never painted the stucco so there was several spots that needed to be repaired first. So it was a big job to say the least. They were very quick to respond and set a time to look so we could get a quote. I will say that they are not cheap. But included in the price they were going to do repairs on the stucco, they were going to paint the front room, and also paint the large shed in our backyard. We had to wait a few months before they had an appointment available, but it was worth the wait. JJ and his crew were amazing. They were fast. They had the house almost completely done on the first day and second day they were only here for a few hours to finish up some smaller stuff. When I did the final walk through I was in complete shock, my house looks amazing. I seriously can't get over how good it looks. Crash of Rhinos might be a little more expensive than other companies but they give you your money's worth.

Bar food was fried and greasy in the bad way. If you like your fried food crispy, this isn't the place to go. I had tried the fried pickles, chicken wings, and chicken tenders. The spinach and artichoke dip was decent, but a little too decadent for my own good. 

The best part about the ale house, though is the $3 pint. They have a huge selection to choose from. My favorite is the Sweet Water Blue which is your basic Sweet Water with a dash of blueberries.

I thank the emergency animal clinic for being so kind, compassionate, and giving Tiger Lily dignity in her final moments.

I loved my drink so much I vowed I would try to copy it and make it every day. Our service was very friendly and efficient and I felt like the staff knew the menu well. My husband ordered the grilled swordfish and I had the Friday night special the king crab cioppino.

The swordfish was cooked perfectly but the very best thing by far was the King crab cioppino. Our waiter said they almost always sell out of it on Fridays.  The broth was so delicious and it was loaded with scallops, king crab, mussels, some sort of pasta, and some other delicious seafood. It was a big enough portion that two people could easily split it. It comes with some bread so you could soak up the broth.

I got 5 lbs of wings here to share amoungst 3 people, and and extra choice of sauce. I remember that it used to be a struggle to eat 50 wings amoungst 3 people, but here, we finished the 5lbs (roughly 50 wings) relatively easily and I could have personally eaten 15-20 more.

I went there because there was oil in my coolant and my seat belt wasn't working.  They kept my car for one ENTIRE week, and every time I called them, they told me that they would call me back.
In the end, they absolutely could not tell me why there was oil in my coolant, and they told me they had no idea how to fix it and to just buy a new engine-they also couldn't tell me where to go to get a diagnosis.
To add insult to injury, they bought a used seat belt from a junkyard, installed it without telling me, and it was literally COVERED IN OIL-it was 90% totally black and when you touched it, filth and grease came off in your hand.  Then they had the nerve to charge me almost $300 for the ""repair"".  To make it worse, they threw away (so they said) my perfectly clean, tan colored seat belt.

You would be better off asking your maiden aunt Matilda to take a stab at fixing your car or maybe your three year old child. In fact, I'm pretty sure my dogs are smarter than these guys.

Then, add the fact that it REEKS of cigarettes and they blow it in your face while you're forced to put up with it.

3286,2,1546560000000,"1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables, when we made reservation expecting to sit in the restaurant, not outside! There was no information about this. If the restaurant inside seats g is full. Then they should mention to the customers making reservations that they will be sitting outside!!!
2. Food is mediocre at best! They even screwed my order. Asked for risotto and got some pasta, not sure what.
3. Asked for two cabs, someone at restaurant changed it to one big cab instead which could not hold all of us so we had to wait for another 25 mins for another one!!
 Would not recommend to anyone. Enough other good restaurants in Pittsburgh to go to. They have to have paid their way into magazines rating them highly!",1
3304,2,1548460800000,"You know, we have supported this place from day one.  We have gone there when NO ONE went there.  We actually didn't think it would stay open, so we kept going hoping it would make it.  Well, we actually went there this past weekend after having very mediocre service and food for the past couple of visits.  It was packed and the place appeared still be doing great.  When our food came it was good but our 8 year old dropped his toast.  We asked if he could get another piece and the waiter said ""sure"".  Well, when the owner saw this she refused.  She wouldn't even allow the waiter to get him a single piece of bread without paying for a full order or toast.  The waiter was even stunned she was so rude about it.  ???  Are you kidding me?  When my wife asked her why she couldn't just let the waiter get a single piece of toast, she just blew off my wife.  We just spent $60 for breakfast and she couldn't get our kid a single piece of bread without paying for a full order.  

I think the egos of these owners are getting out of control. We have 2 other friends who have had similar experiences with different issues.  Too bad that success has driven such arrogance.  We won't be back...ever.",2
3307,1,1547078400000,"Went here for breakfast, only to find out we were too late and had to eat lunch.  It was 11:45 am and breakfast finished at 11:30 am.  Shucks, our fault for not asking. But, if you are a restaurant that only serves breakfast and lunch and you close at 2pm, don't you serve both the whole time?  I never thought to call to ask, because I've never heard of any place separating those meals and only serving one at a time, when they are only a breakfast lunch spot in the first place. Anyway, that's not anyone's fault, just a comment.  So we ordered lunch, which none of us wanted, but we had a Groupon to use, so we figured we'd just be done with it, since it's not that close to home to start with and we didn't want to come back.  The food was a big disappointment.  My mom's tuna sandwich came out on dry bread, that the waitress agreed with and happily replaced.  You can tell those slices had been sitting out and drying up.  Don't you know to check for that before you use the pieces that are exposed to the air at the front of the bag?  She also said her tuna salad was very dry.  It was a big sandwich, but that's about all.  My daughter ordered a side of bacon and it was shocking.  Cold, reheated, limp and burned. The waitress also couldn't believe what it looked like and happily took it back.  My hamburger was okay.  It looked and sounded better than it tasted.  The bun was nice.  The french fries were fake, frozen, cold and limp and I specifically asked them if they served home made fries beforehand, to which they said yes.  These were clearly not homemade.  We didn't have anything else, as that was quite enough.  Big disappointment after all the kind reviews.  Our waitress was wonderful however and the only plus in the place, hence 2 stars. They're both for her.   I wish we had made it in time for breakfast, I am sure that would have been better, from the sounds of things, but I won't be returning to find out.",2
3311,1,1548115200000,"On the first visit, I was the fourth car in line and waited 30 minutes for my food. Decided to give the place one more try. Unbelievably, I was the third car in line and waited 35 minutes! I actually got out of the car and went to the front window. I said I was still the second car in line and have been waiting over 30 minutes. The first two females just looked at me then two men stood there and said nothing. Finally a female comes and I tell her my concern. She says sorry for the wait, the cook had to leave for a little while because the owner called in an order? I went to my car thinking never again will I come to this place.",2
3318,2,1548460800000,"I ate lunch here over the weekend.  I was waiting for this place to open because it's so close to my house.  I did the all you can eat lunch, which is priced a little higher on the weekends.  It comes with two oysters (there is an all you can eat oyster add on option) and you can also get food from the buffet in addition to whatever sushi you want.  The service was really good and I was very happy with the quality of the food.  Definitely going back.",2
3320,1,1548288000000,"My wife and I went there for lunch and it was our first time.  I was surprised to see such a long wait for lunch so we decided to sit at the bar to avoid the 30 min wait.  The bartender was nice and helpful and you could tell she was busy being the only one behind the bar.  We ordered the Diablo and the Breakfast burger.  Also, we ordered fries and sweet potatoes fries.  We asked for the burger and fries to be brought out together but instead they came out separately.  As an aside, I didn't like that burgers don't come with fries and that you had to order separately.  The burgers came out about 10 min after the fries and the burgers were luke warm similar to comments that have been posted.  However, the taste was fantastic! I had the gluten free bun and it was nice and light.  I tried some of my wife's Diablo and it had a nice smokey heat flavor that was perfect. 

We also got a Nutella milk shake and asked for it to go.  It came out and was in a glass.  I love Nutella and this was an amazing shake just a little thick and you could not drink it through a straw.  So all in all a good experience but seems like there is some communication gaps between what is told to the kitchen staff and what is actually delivered.  Also, I hoping for a warmer hamburger next time. I have high standards for a 50 dollar lunch.",2

She was really sweet and did a great job at trimming just the ends of my hair. I always have problems with the stylists cutting off too much but she did a really good job.

3338,1,1547337600000,"While I used to love this place, the quality has dropped off. Ingredients are still fresh, but the overall quality is lacking. Pizza is many steps above your average delivery.

3339,2,1548892800000,"I hate leaving this review because this was our favorite place prior to the remodel. After last nights meal, we are left feeling extremely disappointed. This is unfortunately another example of a great restaurant that decided to expand and go from pick up at the counter to plates and waiters. In doing so they've really let the quality of the food slip to an unrecognizable point. Parts of the order were left out, all our sandwiches were cold in the middle and side items were soggy. This is far from what we've gotten here in the past. I am actually pretty hurt by this because, again, we loved this place including the relaxed ambiance and basket style outstanding food that we came to know. I really hope they go back to focusing on the food and not waitstaff.",2

Fortunately, family members live close by (their cats don't like him) so they visit while we are gone. He's always well cared for and seems to be enjoying himself and doesn't even care they stopped by. Frankly, she spoils him and he has come to adore her.

Among the regular dishes, I liked their takoyaki and karaage. But I found the yakitori chef special to be average. Although the special dishes that impressed me were the teba gyoza and Osaka cha han. A must try! You can easily order and share with friends in order to have a taste of everything. 

As for service, it was friendly and professional. However, be advised that if you have a group of 3 or more, it might take a while before you get seated. So best make a reservation if you have a large group. 

Overall, I'd give Izakaya Ju a 4/5 and would be happy to eat there again if I'm around Jtown.",2

3355,2,1547164800000,"I was in town staying at the Westin Kierland on a work-related trip. Here are my notes from dinner on a Wednesday night.

1. The restaurant is conveniently located a short walk (across the street) from the hotel in an upscale shopping mall with a number of restaurants including chain establishments such as this one, PF Changs, Mortons, and The Cheesecake factory along with places I've never heard of before (Bar NoRTH, Ra Sushi Restaurant, The Greene House...possibly also chains?)
2. The music inside was way too loud and made it difficult to converse with my dinner companions and hard to hear our waiter. The live band was certainly lively and a nice touch but a few notches quieter would've been preferable.
3. Our waiter, while amiable and knowledgeable about the menu, was a little too wordy. His spiel wasn't super helpful as he took a long time to summarize some of the menu offerings. The order of his descriptions was kind of hapazard and we hadn't had the chance to look at our menus. Plus, the loudness made it hard to understand him.
4. Portions. In a word, HUGE. I ordered the 12oz sashimi style ahi tuna. It was monstrous. I ate a little more than half of it and had to pawn the rest off on my colleagues with heartier appetites.
5. Food. Starter was the chef's salad... My tuna was cooked nicely but was presented on a plate of sauce that was extremely salty. I had a bite of my colleague's braised salmon. My bite was rich, creamy-tasting, and melt-in-your-mouth moist. Delicious. But he didn't end up finishing his plate and I could understand why. A giant 12oz portion of such a rich piece of fish inevitably leads to diminishing returns...
6. Drink. My waiter recommended the Ginger Breeze cocktail for me to go with the ginger that came with my sashimi-style tuna. Not a fan. Too sweet and I couldn't taste the ginger but it did come in the shaker it was made in and was at least two martini-glasses full of drink (like everything else here, they don't skim on the portions).
7. Dessert was the signature Maestro butter cake. Pretty much as advertised, rich, buttery yellow cake with ice cream and whipped cream on the side. I had no real beef with the dessert. I liked that the whipped cream was placed in a separate dish and the ice cream was a tasty (though hard to pinpoint) flavor. The cake itself was good but not great. It smelled and tasted strongly of butter sugary goodness and was very moist and rich.
8. Service. Throughout the night, service was great. Drinks were always promptly and seamlessly refilled. Bread basket came right away and we even got a refill of that.

tl;dr this place is swanky and upscale, specializing in seafood and steaks. The ambiance is loud but service is great. Overall, my experience was fine but the food missed the mark for me as everything was over the top.",2
3359,2,1546300800000,Awesome and unique in Phoenix for ambiance alone.  The service was on point and perfectly staffed.   Very friendly staff.  Excellent food,2

3379,3,1548201600000,"OVERRATED. Took my girlfriend to watch the Lion King (LOVED IT) in December and we were so excited to try this place for brunch. After waiting an exhaustive period of time and watching hordes of people that came after us be seated before us, we confronted the host about it. They realized they totally screwed us so they immediately sat the 2 of us at a booth that could have easily sat around 6 people. OK, that's cool I guess...

When my girlfriend asks our server if they have vanilla lattes he answers without any hesitation: ""no."" A bus boy working in the vicinity over hears us and actually tells us that they do make those because he used to work the espresso bar (I guess he got demoted for knowing too much?!).  Whatever, we are still trying enjoy the experience... 

We ended up ordering the Croque Madame, Corned Beef Hash, and some waffles. Croque Madame, ooh sounds fancy huh? Let me break it down for you: ham and cheese with egg on top. Sounds simple & delicious, well it should be UNLESS the bread is BURNT beyond edibility. After telling the waiter, he explains to us that's how the croque madame is supposed to be. We literally had to take one side of the bread and break it in front of him using both hands. Don't get me wrong, crispy/crunchy bread can be delicious, but this was not that. This was Wolverine-adamantium solid and burnt. The waiter then says to us, ""yea ok, that looks pretty burnt""...

We then had a run-in with his manager. You would think at a high end establishment he would come to our table to let us know that we were being taken care of. No! Instead he tells that the bread might come out the same way. WTF?! Anyways, the next one comes and it's perfectly fine, go figure! Corned beef hash...sigh. Why do I always feel the need to order corned beef hash at a fancy place when I know Hormel corned beef hash is simply the best?! Waffles were good. We really wanted to like this place, trust me. In the end, this was an epic fail. Food sucked b*lls and the service was horrid. Not worth your time and money people...",2

3389,1,1547251200000,"For pick-up or delivery, this place has some damn good Chinese food!  I'm going to keep it short & sweet- They are QUICK (we've played 'delivery games' and ordered Chinese & pizza at the same time and they have never been beat).  The prices are VERY REASONABLE- for the amount & portions you get.  The QUALITY & TASTE is as delicious as I've ever tasted for Chinese.  Try it for yourself and come back to review- I'll bet you'll love it too!

Btw- THEY DO NOT SMOKE.  There's a review on here that 'they smoke around the food' but I've never seen it.  I even asked them if they smoked and they said no.  I have no idea why someone would lie about that other than to drive business to another place.  So why did you lie Ty G.?  Hmm...?",2

3399,1,1547856000000,"***Update since review on 01/18/17*** I have been back to visit this cafe numerous times and the staff seems to have had obvious up-training since!

I have visited this Corner Bakery Cafe a handful of times and ordered the same thing each and every time. The staff have always been quick and polite. Today 01/18 was much different. 

When I came in, there was but one customer ahead of me that had already ordered and was waiting on his food order. I ordered a mocha frappe w/o whip and proceeded to wait 15 minutes, as the first drink made was not the drink I ordered (it was a truffle mocha-iced). 

Upon delivery of the drink to me, the main associate that has been there from I believe when they opened advised that he had to remake the drink as it required a specific base ingredient (which I understand being a former Barista, but it should not have taken 10+ minutes being the only customer he was serving). When I picked up the drink off of the tray, a portion of the drink had made it onto the top of the lid which proceeded to fall onto my business casual attire. 

Not only did this experience negate all other experiences, it made me 25 minutes late to work and the drink proceeded to drip throughout my car on the drive to work. I'd much rather keep my business with other restaurants that have a service recovery procedure in place and are quick to make fixes, especially when I would consider myself a past-regular customer.",3

3408,2,1547942400000,"When you first walk in, you walk between a series of tall aquariums filled with goldfish.  Kind of gimmicky, but still cool.  The design of the restaurant is modern.  The seating layout was not my favorite.  A long community bench seat that had me sitting pretty close to the next group.  The floor beneath and besides my table was covered in scattered rice.  Perhaps a child was eating here before me?  Perhaps they just hadn't swept all day?  I'll give them a pass on that one though.

I started with the hot and sour soup.  This was my favorite dish of the meal.  Mushroom, tofu, and shrimp in broth.  For my main course I had the beef with asparagus.  This was alright.  The beef was tender.  The asparagus was large, fresh, and crisp.  I had a side of pork pot stickers.  These were oily and bland.  Not my favorite.  I had some hot tea with the meal also.  Jasmine I believe.  I had tried the dragon berry cocktail.  It was a mojito-esque drink with a Sprite base and muddle mint leaves, lime, and blackberries.  I would recommend.

My waiter was very friendly and attentive.  I am not sure if I would eat here again with the variety of noodle shops in Vegas, but Beijing Noodle No. 9 was not so bad.",2

I'm not sure if the lady working the register was new or not, but she told me she wasn't sure if she could add a bread bowl to my soup for the pick two option. I found this quite confusing. Also, when I asked iced tea flavors since I couldn't see it on the menu with the light shining so brightly, she told me she wasn't sure. If that wasn't frustrating enough, after my order was placed through and paid for, I was told there were no bread bowls left, so they thought giving me two pieces of bread on the side was compensation. I should have been given my money back or some type of compensation for a better replacement for what I paid for.

But ordering family style becomes super expensive, is confusing, and generally not a fun experience with a large group of people.  There should just be a prix fix for family style with less options.  Everything is charged individually so we racked up quite the bill! Also did not need to hear the waiter go through the entire menu telling us what he would order - that's fine if we ask, but not into you telling us what you would order for each section - we can read we'll be fine. 

A little dark and very loud - but some people are into that.  Wouldn't rush back there for the atmosphere - maybe the food.  Also - FYI - don't give patrons bad looks when they are waiting in the hallway to get their coats.  If you didn't want them to stand in the hallway why is the coat check there?",2

Service was really poor. Especially the lady who served us didn't smile even once and was very cold. It felt like it was too much for her to serve us, muttering under her breath and giving retorts to whatever request we were making. 
Food itself was nothing to write home about. Having lived in Chennai for 6 years, we know our South Indian cuisine. Sambar was nothing but daal; no spices not even hot. Dosa filling was unevenly seasoned. Coconut chutney was stale. Dosa itself was served cold. 
Paneer Tikka masala kathi roll that we ordered was a joke. A meagre 4 inches wrap, very dry inside. Paneer pieces were just sauteed; no Tikka masala, seasoning. 
The only reason I am giving a two star is because of the person who greeted us, took our order and served us water. He was very welcoming and friendly.",2

I had the Andoullie Sausage breakfast which is wonderfully grilled (a bit charred, which I like) and served on top of the most wonderful grits you have ever tasted (fresh corn taste and a nice rough texture) and on top is two fried eggs (had mine over easy). Cost is about $12 and fresh squeezed orange juice was $2. I'm not a huge fan of everything layered so next time I will ask for the eggs on the side but still, those grits, like something you read about in gourmet magazine, so good! As for the coffee, I would recommend they get a better supplier, maybe the locally roasted coffee from the Cartel Coffee Lab in Tempe and they should consider putting fresh cucumber slices in their water pitchers, to add an extra refreshing taste, like they do at Sens Asian Tapa bar - well worth the price though and I consider it an excellent place to eat breakfast on a Sunday morning.",1

We left there wondering how in the world he knew my first name...I'm guessing now it was from my credit card, but still a nice touch that wasn't necessary as they were busy.

The food and ambience was nice as we sat on the porch and enjoyed guacamole that was top flight and a lot of solid food.  My only knocks on the food, aside from the guacamole, was that it seemed a bit overly simplified and the portions were smallish by my wife's standards.

If you're a one time client during non-peak hours, the experience is fabulous.  But if you're a long time customer and/or place an order Friday/Saturday/Sunday, be prepared for disappointment.

I want to love Foodie Call, I really do, and after 4 years averaging 1 order a week, in the $50-$100 range, you would think I did.

I'm a slave to convenience, so the idea of a food courier service (that includes drinks!) is HEAVEN.  I'm definitely willing to pay extra for the luxury, and on top of the $5 delivery fee, usually tip 20%.

But I'm tired of the inconsistency, the rudeness, and the lack of respect for loyal customers.  For every great experience there's an equally crap one, like waiting 2-3 hours for your food, being berated by a driver for questioning an order (turns out it was filled incorrectly), no one answering the phone, or having drinks forgotten.

3566,2,1546560000000,"We were looking for a restaurant open on Christmas Day. Sushi 21 was, and not only that, they were running a promotion for AYCE sushi: $10 for dinner for writing a Yelp review. Best deal ever!

As with a typical AYCE sushi place, they make the sushi on demand. They have a huge assortment of rolls, a subset of the traditional nigiri, and some other (mostly Korean) appetizers: bulgogi, ramen, and spicy pork.

Part of this was an ordering error on our part, but most of the rolls ended up tasting the same despite having different sauces. The rice had a strange texture, probably an artifact of mass production. The fish was fresh but medium quality and sliced thinner than a traditional sushi restaurant would slice it.

On the up side, the servers were very prompt and friendly. They used preprinted sheets to take your order (like a dim sum place). Strangely they ran out of hot water to make tea but were able to heat some more in 10 minutes. Dishes were efficiently whisked away. One of the servers had a hard time understanding us and took plates we wanted to keep and didn't refill our tea when we asked.

All in all, we would be Grinch-like to complain about the super good deal we got. But if I were paying full price, I might try one of the more established players closer to the heart of Chinatown. So four stars for he Christmas special deal and maybe 3 stars if we were paying full price (as of Dec 2015, their prices were $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner).",2

The dining set up is generally the same with minor accented tweaks here and there.  I was lured to this place initially because it didn't look like they took their ""V"" grade, turned it upside down and drew a line threw it for a fictitious ""A"" grade, unlike other Louisiana style seafood dumps.  Problem is, ""the mob is fickled,"" and sad to say people sometimes are quick to jump on the bandwagon.  But enough about the old joint, it is obvious the new owners wanted to create their own niche.

Nevertheless, the hip doctor undoubtedly paid a visit to this place and modernized it with an industrial/urbanish twist with the decor, ambiance and music genre playlist.  Even much of the old staff is still here, although, I bird told me that the new owners include those from Pho Kim Long amongst other unknown benefactors.

I was hungry and was recommended to try the Mi Sate, as it looked quite filling considering that it is primarily peanut butter based.  It was sort of like Mi Quang, Kare Kare and sate stew had menage, producing a love child of savory goodness.  I added the grape leaf wrapped beef appetizers to switch things up as well.

I gotta say, the dishes are unique, bold and a nice eccentric version on Vietnamese cuisine that is practically absent through the entire city and I only hope for their success.  

Best of all, Vy, who looks to be one of the head honcho-ess (?), gave word that they will be offering Nikka, Hibiki and Yamazaki Japanese whiskey along with other unique refreshments.  It is now a must that I come back with like minds.",2

It's definitely not a fine dining place but then again, HK style usually means fast, economical, and simple. This place hits all 3. Taste is great too of course.

We asked for queso dip as our appetizer, as well as our two main orders (lobster quesadilla and veggie quesadilla).  Our appetizer never showed up.  We asked multiple times and she kept saying: ""I'll go grab it right now"", only to disappear for some time and forget about it entirely.  When the final bill came, she was 'shocked' when I told her to remove the queso dip from our bill (she couldn't believe it was never served to us).

As for the food, it was just OK.  My wife's veggie quesadilla had two or three small pieces of fish in it.  My lobster quesadilla was supposed to come with pico de gallo, but it didn't.

3717,3,1547251200000,"I purchased a Groupon for a manicure and pedicure for $40.  I then paid $15 extra to upgrade to a shellac manicure.  I had never heard of the shellac brand they used and the colour choices were very limited.  Don't bother trying to match a shellac colour to any of the regular colour choices for the pedicure because there isn't a single one that is the same.

The pedicure itself was not too bad although I would have preferred a bit more work on smoothing my feet.  The shellac manicure was just horrible.  First of all, I was told not to bother taking off my rings as they cannot use lotion on my hands for a shellac manicure.  Isn't that part of a manicure? After one coat I was asked if that was okay.  I'm sorry? I could see through the polish!  No, that's not okay, a manicure calls for at least two coats of polish!  Once the ""manicure"" was done, which was basically a bit of filing leaving my nails rough and jagged, a quick set of polish (the least amount of time I have ever had to have my hands in the led/uv machine) and then a coat of some sort of oil on my finger tips (you couldn't use lotions but you can coat my fingers in oil??), I then noticed 6 out of 10 of my nails were bubbled/rippled from not setting properly. I pointed this out and was told they could fix it but I would have to wait at least half an hour and then have the old stuff soaked off and reapplied - at least another hour to hour and a half in the salon.  Another esthetician came to look at my nails and declared that they had been ""touched"".  I'm not sure how I could ruin them by touching when it's a shellac manicure and there is not time for touching/inspecting until the manicure is complete!  She then asked me if I could come back later in the day because they really didn't have time to fix it.  I decided it wasn't worth my time and left.

Not even a week later and all of my shellac colour is peeling/chipping.

Inferior products and terrible work!",2

It's roomy and elegant for a ""diner"". Not crowded at all the whole time we were there. The place was clean and our service was friendly and efficient. 

In fairness, I have to say that I wasn't hungry at all, so I ordered a generic appetizer. I'm not going to bother to grade the restaurant on that aspect. My dining companion had the Waldorf Wrap, which was grilled chicken, cranberries, almonds, lettuce and ranch dressing. For the purposes of a Yelp review, I had to sample it and it was pretty tasty. The cranberries added a welcome hit of sweetness to what would otherwise have been pretty bland. What I liked too is that there wasn't a boatload of ranch on the wrap as I've had at some other places. 

The menu wasn't overwhelming but offered some pretty appealing choices. This place is open 24/7 and serves breakfast around the clock. For me, prices were reasonable yet leaning toward the ""is it worth it for the portion"" end of the scale.  Overall, I would return again when I'm hungry enough to try something more than cheese sticks and a soda.",2

The staff was very kind and served us very quickly, immediately clearing a table of two for me and my girlfriend as we walked in.

Now the food, I ordered the mechant burger and my girlfriend got the vege burger. The two burgers were accompanied with the braised pork poutine. Unfortunately we were pretty disappointed with all three, my burger was on the dry side and many of the flavors did not really jump out leaving me with just the crunch from the bacon. As for my girlfriend the vege burger tasted more like warm bread than anything. With all the different ingredients in the vege burger much more was expected than the final taste you get from it. The poutine was pretty typical.

Nice place, gets loud at times, chairs are low (and I'm 6'2) also not the most comfortable had to stretch forward to much.

Would Possible give it another try but order something else on the menu.

Cheers.",2

The Stuffed French Toast was good and the Ham and Sweet Potato Hash topped with Eggs was AWESOME! I had never tried anything like it before -- and I would definitely come back again for it.

The atmosphere was peaceful and was a good place to have a business meeting.",2
3739,2,1548892800000,"Facility is similar to a Dave and Busters but with a larger arcade area and a bar instead of restaurant.

Games: Okay selection. Typical games like carnival style, ticket winning games, arcade racing, two rhythm and very few Japanese games. My personal favorite is Taiko Drum Master. Some o the games are rather old and as maintain as other places.

People: For families and children. The kids could be worst and parents have them in line as best they can. Something about the place and the energy causes the parents to be very impatient and irrational.  Probably some kids are pestering their parents and they are at their wits end. The parents are only interested with their kids and they will interrupt your game if their kids want to play. Teenagers are just as bad. ""Every man from himself"" is what this place is like. That happen twice in one visit.

(Specific example, we waited in like for about 1/2-1hr for a game. Then a parent interrupted us when we were playing the game in the beginning and we were like fine. After a while we left and came back. Then we played again after waiting in line for [1/2-1hr] not interrupting the previous player but someone ask us to leave again.)

Arcade is for family which is great but the parents aren't gamers and have zero gaming etiquette.

Staff: Attentive and do what they must. About what you expect.

Come here if you have children. Maybe if you want to go from machine to machine. Not if you want to progress in the game or beat it.",2

3759,2,1547337600000,"HORRIBLE value for the amount of food that you get.  Skip this restaurant unless you're into be robbed and leaving hungry.

ROCK SHRIMP TEMPURA $19
Flash fried shrimp in a sriracha ranch sauce.
*Pretty small portion and if you've ever been to Bonefish Grill, it's just like the bang bang shrimp except smaller and more expensive.

CRISPY RICE $21
Blackened tuna, seaweed, screaming O sauce on crispy rice.
*So this is 5 pieces - horrible for splitting because of the uneven number.  Running theme at this restaurant.  Crispy rice (like a tater tot) was the best part of this appetizer, the blackened tuna was fine but nothing to rave about.

HOT MESS $24 + $10 for king crab = $34 for 5 pieces.  
Crab, sashimi poke, avocado, screaming O sauce.
*For $24 for 5 pieces I'm expecting real crab.  Nope it's imitation crab.  So we decided to substitute for king crab which is $10 extra.  Terrible value.  Again running theme for 5 pieces, terrible to split.  Can we make it 6 so it's even and like most sushi rolls? This was probably the most tasty dish in our entire dinner.  Too bad it was $34.

CRISPY PORK BELLY $25
pork belly, brussels sprout coleslaw.
*So we picked this because we were still hungry (shocker) and the server Ben recommended it.  So it is 8 pieces cut (wow 8!) but the roll is super small and they weren't even cut evenly - like really?  The coleslaw was coated in mayo to the point I couldn't taste the rest of the roll.  I had to actually deconstruct the sushi to make sure there was even pork belly in there.  Yes - about the size of a pea.  Again horrible value.

DESSERT $14
*Server convinced us to get the strawberry souffle which comes with strawberry ice cream.  Great presentation, tasted like cotton candy, but OMG so small!  Literally between the two of us we got 4 bites total, $3.50 a bite eesh.  Not kidding.  

**Pro tip: If you plan on getting sake don't be a sucker by getting a carafe.  It's the worst value here!  It's about 12oz (350ml) for $30-$70.  We got Little Lilly, unfiltered bottle of sake (750ml) for $55 and it lasted our whole dinner.",2

The prices here are higher than I normally pay for nigiri sushi, but the pieces of fish are possibly half again the size that you get at Sushi Mon or Yummy Grill Sushi, so you get more for the money.  The ikura is GREAT- fresh and huge!  I tried their inari and liked that as well- not overly sweet , overly wet or overly dry, and the soy ""pockets"" have a nice texture- I'm picky about my inari and theirs is my favorite so far.   

I had lunch there on a weekday around noon and the place filled up pretty rapidly. But service was slow before it filled up- I think the waitress forgot we were there or assumed we'd need more time to decide.  

The names of their sushi are ridiculous- one even has the word ""a$$"" in it!  The names don't seem to correspond to the food at all (what do you put in a sushi roll called ""Whose Your Pimp?"" anyway?), and the silly names don't jibe with the formal decor and politeness of the waiters either.  I would have been embarrassed to ask one of those nice ladies for that ""a$$"" roll!  :-D

First field I've been to in vegas so I couldn't compare it to the rest of the fields out in town but from the ones I've been to in California, this one isn't all that. The reason I say that is because 1. Reffing wasn't really important to them, you get guys going out to the field but not really doing their job; just hiding out using their cell phones. Staff was real cool  though and down to earth and 2. Would be that they weren't as strict on you like other places I've been to. At lots of other field I get yelled at for liftin up my mask or not having a cover on my barrel, at combat they really ask you nice which might be more comfortable for a lot of people.

plusses (compared to phoenix palace):
- cooler dim sum hall atmosphere in the cavernous hall in the back of mekong plaza
- tends to use thinner skin for dumplings than p.p.
- 10min closer if you're coming down from up north

minuses (compared to phoenix palace):
- little less variety of items, although mekong does offer few things that p.p. does not offer, like bbq pork pies.

We did a margarita sampler with hibiscus, spicy mango, & blood orange, all of which were good and I would consume in their full-sized version.
We had a hard time deciding which guac to choose, since they all sounded so amazing.  We went with the goat cheese guac, and this is a decision that we did not regret.

Last night we went to see the Doobie Brothers and Chicago. At first our experience was amazing!! My husband and I were with my brother who requires ADA seating. An usher greeted us and walked us to our seats and made sure we were comfortable. I was impressed! 

Our seats were in the back row of our section. The next section was separated by a sidewalk/walkway that was probably 8 feet wide. The next section was elevated. 

The Doobie Brothers were on first and were amazing! They were awesome and they encouraged everyone to get on their feet! We did as did most in front of us! It was amazing!! 

After their encore, there was a break so Chicago could get set up. That is when it ALL CHANGED!!
A guy (who had been drinking a lot and was in the section behind us) DEMANDED we sit down during the next set as they couldn't see. We said that this is a rock concert and people stand. That is when this guy spoke to us in a threatening manner and used awful expletives! I got really scared and got security. The first two security staff went to talk to him. A more senior security guy then came to talk to us and said he was moving this guy so we would be able to enjoy Chicago. I told the security guy that I was truly threatened and he promised they would move this guy. I thanked him and was once again impressed.

Well, they didn't move the guy. It was so uncomfortable for us during Chicago. In today's world so many awful things happen and you just never know.!

Why wouldn't Ak-Chin Security move this guy? They promised us. All the people sitting next to us were shocked by his behavior! I was more shocked he wasn't moved. WOW!

What started out as amazing turned into a very scary situation! This was my first visit and I like this venue; I'm just not sure if I will return as I'm uncomfortable with the Security enforcement.

There aren't many attractions/slides but the kids seemed to enjoy it.

When they served it, right on top of the fish was chopped peppers and the fish was spicy hot  for her. So they had to redo her order which took another 20 minutes. By the time her food came, I was done with my dinner. At the end of our not so impressive evening, they gave us the wrong bill. When we told him that we got the wrong bill he apologized and gave us another bill. This bill now did not have the two glasses of wine in it. So we mentioned it again and he said, ""Oh I don't know why my partner did not put it in"" . We ended up with one free drink which he said was complimentary but not apologetic for all the mistakes that evening. So, not an impressive evening at all. We have had better seafood with great service and much better ambiance for less the price of this place.  A good restaurant makes you feel special. We never felt it here.",2
3930,2,1547424000000,Love the atmosphere! Came here during dinner time and there weren't too many people but the server was great! She definitely knew the menu inside and out and was very helpful and friendly. She suggested several items which we ended up ordering but I'd say it was well worth it because the food was great and flavourful and everything overall was great! I'm not a huge burger fan but I was hungry and was tempted by the one of their burger option so I ordered it and boy was it juicy with lots of flavour! And then there were the deep fried onion rings on the side which also was amazing! My friend ordered the regular fries and I got the sweet potato fried and both were great! I would definitely come back!,3
3937,2,1548028800000,"This place is sooooo DO-DO!!!! This spot is located right in front of Treasure Island or to the side of that casino. I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sliders(appetizer) as my meal and it didnt taste good at all. It looked good and sounded good and looked like it had alot of flavor kuz of the BBQ sauce but it was nothing like i thought. I had to put extra BBQ sauce to give it flavor. Then the bun on the bottom got soggy kuz of the juice of the meat... so it was just a mess that didnt have no damn taste!

For Dessert, i ordered the brownie with ice cream, but there was more whip cream than ice cream. They jipped us dammit!!!! The ice cream and brownie was ok but it wasnt great. 

Thank goodness my work paid for it kuz if i had to pay for it then I probably woulda had to complain bout the wack sliders!",2
3939,1,1548028800000,"Had a Vietnamese craving while shopping in Ajax and a friend suggested Pho Mono.  I frequent the east end Pho establishments such as Pho 88, Pho Dau Bo and have always been a fan.

The restaurant is very clean and bright with modern decor touches.  Service is quite good.  Ordering via Ipad is always a plus.

I had ordered Rare beef pho, spring rolls (meat) and the fried tofu.

The pho itself was great.  Good size serving (small), meat was in large pieces, broth was flavorful.  I expected the spring rolls to have that great YELLOW colour that I'm use to and was surprised that when they came out, it wasn't but excited to try.  I feel they were quite a disappointment.  The fried tofu was dry and served with no dipping sauce.

I probably won't come back.",2

Yes the facilities are older and could benefit from some TLC, but at the end of the day there are plenty of options for water slides, pools, wave pools, etc for all to have a good time. We have a small child (nearly 2) and were worried there wouldn't be much for her to do, but they have a nice area for tots and then a pool/slide area suitable for tots and the younger school age crowd. A nice lawn/beach area and they let you bring in your on chairs and canopys. We didn't know this, but would plan to do so next time. Locker rentals are $7 but allow in and out access and take debit cards. We had a good time. Children 2 and under $2 so not bad at all.",2

So when we went in, someone (I think the owner?) greeted us and was wearing like a checkered hat and just seemed like a generally nice guy. We were seated in the small, but comfortable dining room. I ended up ordering the napa valley salad to split with my mom and a cup of chicken noodle soup and she got eggs and potatoes. The kitchen actually split the salad into two bowls, which was a really nice touch! The salad was Ah Maze Ing! Soooo good. It has a really creamy feta, wine soaked onions, walnuts, and apples on top of spinach with a creamy balsamic dressing. I could have licked the bowl, this salad was so good. The soup was also tasty, but nothing super special. My mom's rosemary potatoes were really good, with enough seasoning to give them a tasty flavor and her eggs were cooked perfectly. I will definitely come back here again and try one of their wonderful sounding breakfast items (yesterday they had pumpkin pancakes....yum! but in the name of being 'healthy' I skipped them yesterday, and instead ate a bunch of feta cheese (ha!)....*sigh).

I want to utilize this space to send my appreciation and gratitude for the onsite manager, Christine. (Forgive me this is not the correct name, its been a few months) She went ABOVE and beyond her 'job title' to put a smile on our faces and do the unthinkable. In brief, we had an issue with theft at the resort. Our bags were misplaced and my sister was in tears that her luggage was gone. Christine went to the resort store and did a little shopping, providing us with the essentials (Clothes, sandals, Toiletries, etc etc) that would get us through the remainder of our trip. She and her staff also ended up recovering the luggage by the end of the night. I can't say that the security guards and front desk staff were as polite but they did their job. Christine stood out because her genuine personality showed that she truly cared about our situation and was willing to do anything and everything she could to help us make the best of it.

Upon checking in, the front desk younger Filipino/Mexican woman was a bit unhelpful. I was the first to check in and the room was not yet in my name. She provided zero suggestions to me and was very unhelpful. After about 15 minutes of frustration, a young gentlemen was much more welcoming and saved the day! 

Don't get me wrong, this place is a gorgeous property, but I do feel as if it were for the older/ more relaxed community. My sister also owns at another resort and I just felt as if it were more vibrant and entertaining of a resort. I'm just trying to compare apples to apples by experience.",2

3977,1,1547251200000,"I was so excited to try this stall because I love portuguese egg tarts. I had them in Macau a while ago and I still remember how delicious they were. Pastel de Nata 1881 is located inside the Las Vegas North Premium Outlet. 1 is for $3 and 4 for $10. Obviously, we went for the better deal and got 4 egg tarts. We were offered samples but we knew we were going to get them anyway. They smelled amazing when we opened up the box.

I agree with other reviews where the egg tarts weren't hot enough. Although they were lukewarm, the shell was still flakey and crispy. I also thought the filling wasn't as smooth as I expected it to be. Some bites were lumpy so it had a weird texture in the mouth. It might just have been a bad batch but these Portuguese egg tarts definitely could not be compared to ones in Macau. However, it served a good snack after doing a lot of shopping at the outlet.",3

The office was a little bit of a mess.  They wanted me to make another appointment (costing another $300+) to review my labs.  I ended up having to have them email me my labs and have my regular doctor look at them because they were so expensive.  When my labs came back, they charge over $3000 to my insurance (just for bloodwork) leaving me with a bill for labs close to $400.  After all of this, I have no answers.

Cafeteria-style where you choose your udon or rice bowls, then pick out your tempuras and oden (fish cakes). 
Large portions sure to leave you full. 

Try the creamy lemonade! Very different from anything I've had. 

They close between lunch and dinner to prepare fresh noodles. 

Not all onigiri options were available, even though they were advertised, such as the plum, which I was badly craving! That was a bummer.

We arrived at 2pm on a Friday (because I hear lunch is crazy busy) and there were still quite few people dining inside and outside the cafe.  It is true-The owner Olivier takes his time to explain menu items if you have any questions.  I could feel that he loves being there.

We had the special of the day: The pork loin sandwich - tender slices of pork with a creamy sweet sauce, mushrooms, shaved parmesan, baby spinach and tomato on an extremely well made baguette (crispy crunchy exterior texture, soft interior).  Absolutely delectable.  The chocolate tart and pear tart were very delicious as well.  I'd like to come back to sample the quiche (they ran out) and the rest of the menu :-D.

Roasted Beet Salad w/ Scallion Dressing & Toasted Pumpkin Seeds (2/5)
Bar Buca's was better by far. It's a cute starter but it lacks in flavour concerning everything.

Baked Goat Cheese Polenta w/ Sundried Tomato Paste & Pesto (3.5/5)
There was a tiny, tiny, tiny teaspoon of tomato paste in the middle ontop of the polenta under the pesto which was a bit disappointing. The pesto was nice and herbaceous and I loved the salad underneath to help complement the polenta. I don't recall any strong goat cheese flavour and this dish was very filling for an appetizer.

1.50$ Bread (5/5)
The bread was fucking amazing. The crust was so crispy and fragrant with herbs and cheese and the bread was so soft and delicate homg. droolzzz

Braised Boneless Beef Short Rib w/ Root Veg & Navy Beans (3/5)
Maybe I didnt have enough of it to judge it as I only had a bite? But it was pretty decent; the beef was cooked perfectly to be honest with you and the flavour of the sauce and the vegetables together made it a really nice hearty, earthy dish but I don't think I could finish this as it would get too boring for me.

Pumpkin Seed Crusted Salmon w/ Mango & Smoked Red Pepper Salad (4.5/5)
This was the best flavour trip I've went on for an itallian restaurant. The contrasting textures of the crunchy seeds, crispy yet chewy skin, flaky but moist salmon, slightly crunchy mangoes, soft red peppers. It was a thrill eating this. The flavours of all the components complimented each other ALOT and I would I highly recomend this dish to anyone to try. The only reason why I knocked half a star was because there was a minimal amount of red pepper salad when there could've been more because I didn't notice any red pepper until halfway into eating the salmon that I noticed it.

Warm Banana Chocolate Pudding (4/5)
I really liked this and I wish it was hotter and I wish I knew what that white sauce was, it was such good comfort food as a dessert.

Flourless Chocolate Cake (5/5)
Me and my friend loved this cake it was so moist yet so fluffy, melt in the mouth even and the blueberry reduction made it perfect! Ahhh, me and my friend are still dreaming about this cake lol.

When i pulled out of the way he did the exact same thing and backed into the pump also nearly hitting another vehicle! This all while a rider is in the car. This was at 4pm at the gas station on pitt airport propety.

Car number a49926 plate: tx 49920. Have pictures of all. Was a black male driver. I pulled into the pump next to him to gas up and told him I was clearly trying to get in that pump, he then looked at me with a blank face and ignored me.

 I have never used ztrip but guaratee i never will now. An UBer or Lyft or Taxi driver would NEVER do that. Poor drivers, and looking at other reviews seems like service in general sucks. Hire better employees and fire drivers like this!",2

They said that they verified my insurance. I told them I didn't have enough to pay for the work myself. They said not to worry, that it was all covered. Months after my procedure they sent me a 1k bill. I called the office and the lady said to me, you should have read the fine print. I was blown away. I couldn't believe they took advantage of me like that

Update: 
I received a very nice call from the Dr. herself and I actually remember her. She was very kind listened to my issue and said she would have billing call me and work something out. Billing called me offered $100 off and that's it. I asked if they would let me break the payment into 3 payments. When I still feel that over 1k was ridiculous, I was willing to accept the 100 off and pay three payments. As a single mom can't do all myself. The billing lady basically said that's it, nothing else they can do. I'd rather pay double and have my attorney handle now and reach out to different media outlets about the scam service they put on people with misleading information about insurance.

We should have known we were in for a disaster when the poorly designed dining room (dumpy leather couch  from someone's dorm room in the way too-big waiting area?) only had one table of people at 8:30pm on a Friday night. But we had been looking forward to checking the place out for so long we let them seat us anyhow and tried to make the best of it by straining our necks to watch the too-small, misplaced TV's and ordering some food off of the very few options on their 1-page, Kinko's printed menu with too-small font. 

While waiting for our food, we watched the wait staff deliver a plate of nachos to an empty table by the front door/windows (where hundreds of people walked by, looked in at the boring scene, and kept on moving). The employees proceeded to grab a few nachos here and there every time they passed by, and a few even sat down to eat. I thought maybe they were off the clock until one of them left the nachos, went in the back, and came back out with our food delivery. 

The food was just so-so and not at all worth the price. I asked the server for some salt for my french fries and she dropped off an actual cup with salt in it and then started to walk off (as if this was the norm). I asked if there were any salt shakers, she said no, and then walked back to her own table of food. 

 I wish I could rate the game area but it's completely blocked off from the bar and restaurant (WHY??) and the dining experience was such a disappointing and boring downer that we decided to leave and head across to Yard House and Blue Martini to finish our date night instead.  

 We will never be going back here and my prediction is that it will be closed within a year unless some SERIOUS changes are made.",2

I was told I can finance at a set amount. All I had to do was agree to a credit report in which a qualified. They come back with a number 6-7 k off. I ask why even run my credit if you are not able to give for the price you said was possible. His only answer is ""idk how you want me to take off 6k more"" They play too many games here. By the way, BellFord was 4K cheaper for the same truck and they never had to go back and forth and waste time, it was a one time deal.

Recently, their noodles are being served with a hardness that is inedible and is definitely undercooked (not at the level of al den-ante but raw dough). I wonder if the chefs timers are broken because even when I order ""soft"" noodles, I still receive very hard noodles. Communication with the servers are difficult because they don't really speak English...this has happened three or four times now and it's very disappointing to see the second location doing so poorly.",2

The restaurant is always very hot in spring and summer. Many other customers were unhappy the last 3 times we went. I don't complian but paying over 120$ for two ppl (we dont drink) at dinner I expect more. The one male waiter is very rude. Unfortunately he has waited on me the past 3 times. He acts pretentious.  We were sitting next to 3 elderly woman. One of the woman said she just turned 92. They asked for the checks to be split up and the waiter refused to split the check! Seriously it would take 2 min but he just kept telling the woman no. They were very upset. I was upset for them. I think Paris 66 should try to be nicer to there customers and also turn down the AC! The last two times I ate here I was worried the food was bad concidering the table of men next to us and my husband and waiters/waitresses were all sweating! Deserts are what they should focus on because they make some good ones! I gave this restaurant 4-5 chances before I wrote a bad review. I feel awful but I feel like after so many failed attempts I should let others know!  Maybe I just go at the wrong days/times.,2

I like the choice of bar, booth or table- depending on who you are eating with I guess.

I can go pretty much anywhere else and get a tall draft for $5-6 for the same type of beer. Soda also comes in small bottles, not out of the fountain like most restaurants, causing you to pay $2 per soda every time you need a refill.  I personally like to have a few drinks with dinner and simply cannot afford to pay $60-70 with food and drink very often. If it wasn't for the drink costs I would come more often.",2

Service was brutally bad! Not the asian restaurant regular bad, I'm saying these guys are the cab drivers of Korean BBQ service. The food is ok. The burner to cook on is too small. They have this stupid rule that if one person orders AYCE everyone has to order all you can eat. 2 things that really stood out on craptastic service!

1. We came here for a friends birthday and brought the cake early so it was hidden and kept in their fridge. Once everyone was done eating we asked for the cake and asked for the cake and asked for the cake again. 38 minutes later they came over to us and asked if we needed anything, we let them know we would like our cake and got nothing for another 10 min. We finally get the cake and everyone by this point is just wanting to leave so we asked for the checks for everyone and waited so long that we were about to just walk out. Im not over exaggerating the times, it was really that bad! The checks didn't come for another 15 minutes.

2. The lady that came to clean grill was an absolute blast to watch! Instead of taking the Iron burner off an replacing it with a new one she started scrubbing it with a dry napkin that basically shredded apart and feel into the holes which just burned and a bunch of napkin smoke was coming through the vents. The best part was she grabbed our meat and put it on the burner so we now have meat infused with napkin smoke. It was delightful!

 I've eaten at a lot of places in the 20 years I've lived in this great city but this place would win for the worst service I have experienced. Over 30 bucks for 6th string service.",2

The coffee and snacks are decent, I tried their lemon bar, while my comrades had the peanut butter bar and rice crispy bar. Prices are the same as most coffee joints, you'll pay over $2.50 for a cup of coffee, and I don't think they offer refills, so that's kind of disappointing considering most sit down mug of joe places do offer them. The treats are wrapped in cellophane and handed to you sans plate, which makes it feel like something you'd buy at a gas station. Would I come back? Probably not, as there are so many hip and trendy places to get an over priced cup of coffee, and if I am choosing to pay more, then I am going for the atmosphere and I like to feel like I'm getting quality if I'm not paying for quantity.

4441,1,1548028800000,"This is a fantastic company. I have read many reviews online about them before hiring them to paint and protect our investment. I have an extensive background in custom painting and can honestly say I could not have done a better job myself. For me it was the value of my time knowing the Arizona sun will damage whatever was applied over time. Here is my review. Please enjoy!

The Salesman:

The salesman was on time and walked me through the process, where the painting process was reviewed, pricing was outlined and he even noticed some repair items that they were more than happy to address for me. It was outlined what would be protected and it was easy for me to visualize what my home would look like. Something that set him apart from other estimates is that he recommended Emulsabond for adhering the paint to the chalky surface of the aged stucco. It is a additive that many other painters said they do not need as the ""high quality"" paint has additives- it really does not. It was nice to hear the quote and what was offered before letting him know I owned a painting company in the past and that his vision of prep work, thoroughness and focusing on quality over the quote total was exactly how I ran my business. 

We changed around the quote a few times regarding the colors and our HOA, this was a lengthy process. The only downside was that the quote was not in extensive detail which was requested, however once the owner Joe Campbell was notified, the concern was rectified and I could not be happier. I suggested a color agreement clause in the contract- what colors/ he agreed and said it would help others so we may see it in the future contracts. He was a pleasure to work with. It was easily fixed and he did everything to accommodate us.


The Painting Professionals

Don a Danny showed up early every day consistently. I understand that the August heat was rough to work in so I let them know what time we typically awoke and they can start as early as possible. They did show up early, but were so quiet we did not realize they were on their property. They took a full day to prep the home which included power washing, caulking, and priming and protecting property. They allowed prep work to dry for the remainder of the day- as opposed to rushing the job. Over the next few days the painters took time to deliver a quality product and stood open to feedback to assure I was happy as we went through the process. The job ended up taking an additional day and the crew and owner was happy to extend the schedule and work slightly longer to finish as opposed to rushing off to begin the next job. In the end the job was done fantastically and when the painters introduced themselves on the first day I pointed out my expectations and they both said they paint the clients homes as they would their own. 


The Company
The company actually under promised and over delivered, which was nice to see that I found a company that can deliver a well priced quality product and did not seem to skimp on paint, quality, time or by taking shortcuts. I fully intend to promote and refer them to friends and family.",2

4463,2,1546732800000,"I can't even begin to describe how much easier my move was as a result of using Rent Our Boxes. I needed to get out of my house quickly and was doing everything at the last minute. I emailed Bill one Friday evening to request more information about renting boxes, and he delivered boxes to my house the next afternoon. In the past I have had to run all over town and beg for extra boxes at stores, then figure out how to get them all into my car, then find packing tape, then run back to the store because I forgot to buy bubble wrap, then panic because I didn't have any packing paper and it was midnight and the movers were coming the next morning... and so on. Rent Our Boxes provides everything you need, including box delivery and pick-up, tape, bubble wrap, etc. right down to the permanent markers for labeling the boxes. The boxes are incredibly sturdy and easy to use - they have handles and stack up into neat little cubes. Packing was so easy because everything was a standard size so I didn't have to guess and strategize about what would fit into which box. Having a nice, neat stack also helps when you are packing because it helps minimize the chaos of stuff everywhere. I needed more boxes and Bill delivered them the very next day, no problem.

The standard-sized boxes made a HUGE difference for the movers. Because they didn't have to spend time playing Tetris with my stuff, they got everything in the truck FAST. Unloading was also fast because the boxes stacked neatly and were easy to carry. The whole move, from start to finish, including moving out of a rowhouse, down the steps, driving across town, down a walkway and around the corner, and then up the stairs into a third story walk-up apartment, only took three hours. The movers told me to expect 4-6 hours (at $115/hour) and I am convinced that having the boxes made all the difference. Unpacking has been easy too because once flattened, the boxes stack up nicely because they're all the same size. I am also not as stressed out about unpacking because I know that I don't have to figure out how to get all the boxes out of my apartment and to a dumpster or recycling center - they'll come pick them up when I'm done! Easy!

I am so grateful to Bill and Rent Our Boxes for this incredible service. The cost is totally reasonable and I more than made up for it in the reduced expenses associated with hiring movers - not to mention the intangible benefits associated with the reduced hassle/stress for me in terms of figuring out all of the logistics of acquiring moving supplies. There is no question that I will use Rent Our Boxes again for my next move and would recommend the service to anyone.",2

The soup was really good but then it went downhill. The portions were tiny. When one of us asked for some hot sauce we were told that they don't have anything that will mask the taste of the food.

4500,3,1548892800000,"McSorley's, as most other reviews note, is a kitschy local pub. Most patrons are regulars. In the early evening there are usually many families with kids in for an affordable dinner out. Friday would be their most popular night- it is usually quite busy. TV's are everywhere & you can watch the sporting event of your choice (Leafs, Raptors, Jays & NFL football games are usually played with full sound). All the staff are friendly & helpful. Lots of beer on tap- probably a dozen or more varieties. Bottled beer is kept on ice- I particularly enjoy that. Free salted peanuts- throw your shells on the floor. As to the food- it is what it is. Since a change in ownership in 2016, the menu has changed several times, unfortunately for the worse, but you can still get acceptable pub grub. Wings are still grilled & are still good. Pizzas have also remained on the menu & they are also pretty good. On Fridays they have homemade curry (chicken, lamb & beef- rotated weekly)- it is excellent. Once a week (Monday or Tuesday- can't remember) they have ""Burger Bar""- much, much better than their regular menu burger (why not just have burger bar every day & get rid of the ""normal"" burger???). Wrap sandwiches seem to remain popular, although I haven't tried them. There is also a steak night (decent for the price) & on Saturday they have Mexican night- tacos, fajitas, etc... In short, McSorley's serves decent/ average pub food. You shouldn't be going to a bar like this expecting gourmet food- you get basic pub fare, as it should be. As mentioned in a couple of previous reviews, McSorley's is like a second living room for local Leasiders. A place to watch the game & have a few pints with some wings if you're hungry. Five stars because it is what it is- a local sports bar/pub & service is excellent.",1

Not much that I can add to any other review. If you've seen one, you've seen em all. 

I've moved from the other side of town (South Charlotte) and it's nice to know Publix is on this side. Especially when the 9month Pregnant wife craving their wings. It's a prayer answered.

It was gone by the time I was a teenager.....however, I remember the distinct orange & white striped building and the Burgers.

I was excited to finally give it a try as an adult.  I ordered a Whataburger ($2.64) w/Bacon ($1.17) & Cheese ($.49)....and the cashier suggested I add Jalapenos ($.49)....

The Burger was OK, nothing special.....it did taste just how I remember it.  The distinct flavor of the Onions & Mustard in the Burger brought back memories.  The Chicken Strip Sandwich was above average, which surprised me.  The Chicken is real, White Meat Chicken Breast, and the BBQ Sauce was decent.  The Fries were just OK.

Overall, it was an OK meal for a fast food joint.

The 50 cent well drinks were a bit wattery but I mean, they're 50 cents so... We got other drinks and shots later and they were well-made and tasty. Everyone was just so nice here!

My bf and I started out with a plate of fresh spring rolls. For vegetarians like us, this was a perfect starter. Tofu, rice noodle wrapped with very crisp iceberg lettuce. It really hit the spot on our hungry stomach.

Upon the waitress' recommendation, I ordered pad-thai like dish. This was ok. Below my expectation. There was too much sweet sauce, which bothered me little bit. My bf's vegetable curry (squash, green beans, eggplant, carrot) was pretty excellent. No complaint on this one.

The place was basically empty when I came, but I guess it was a snowy Tuesday night after all. We were taken to a table right away, which was to be expected. The hibachi chef was pretty good and seemed intent on giving us a good show even though it was just me and my girlfriend, and the food was good. Not ""best thing in the world"" good, but good. I got some steak and scallop dish and my girlfriend got swordfish. As I said, the steak and scallops were good, tasty, but nothing too special about them. My girlfriend's swordfish seemed rather dry, but I've never had swordfish before so I have no point of reference.

Seeing the place, I can kind of understand how they might get overwhelmed when they're full, considering the place has at least 3 floors of seating, but my experience was positive. It should be noted that I came with a Groupon. I'm not a particularly affluent college student so this place probably would have been out of my price range without the Groupon, so I can't exactly speak to whether I feel full price would have still been worth it.

There was a rainstorm which would delay our arrival so I phoned the restaurant to inform them we would be late (12 minutes). The woman on the phone said ""ok, no problem"". One of our party did arrive at 6:00 and was told that there was no reservation and that for a party of our size it would be a 2-1/2 hour wait!!!  This party member said there must be a mistake that there was a reservation. The manager promptly walked him outside so there would not be a scene!  Are you serious??

I explained that we had called and he said they received no such call which was a lie!  I showed him my reservation confirmation.  He was rude not only to me but my guests.

4581,2,1548460800000,"DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE; Kultura is all smoke and mirrors with NO culinary substance to speak of. It tries too hard to provide upscale service as a way to mask their ultimately mediocre, and sometimes downright bad, food. 

PRICE:
- For what you actually get in taste and finesse, it's highway robbery. 
- For the prices that you're paying (average $17 per appetizer) you should not have to feel like they are butchering the ingredients. 
- Only saving grace is that their wine by the glass selection (around $12) was quite good. 

SERVICE:
- The service was fine. The host was helpful as was the waitress and the runners who described the dish to you. No one was snotty and overall it was alright.
- Only problem I had was I couldn't understand the bridging between the type of service they're trying to provide with the type of food they're sending out. They had their staff explain the dishes to you in an attempt at fine dining but from the moment you put any of it in your mouth it's such a complete disappointment that service without a description would have been less insulting. 

AMBIANCE/CROWD:
- There are three areas to the restaurant. The main floor section where it's more quiet and more conducive to one on one gatherings. 
- The second floor is divided into two areas. The front area that matched the downstairs area quite well but the back room area was reminiscent of what a mafia team would have put together. Brick walls, high ceilings, dark colours, bar on one side and an overall I-had-to-go-through-a-small-back-street,-through-three-back-doors-and-a-kitchen-to-get-into-this-secret-operation kind of place. 
- Crowd: like as if Woodbridge exploded everywhere and was the new colour of the season. (No offense to anyone from Woodbridge). People were around mid-late twenties with too much attitude but no substance to back it up with. A lot of pretension: cold stares, uptilted chins, big hair, men's arms draped on backs of sofas. 
- The majority had definitely gum-smacked their way down from the 905.

FOOD:
***WHERE DO I EVEN START TO DESCRIBE THE CATACLYSMIC CULINARY CATASTROPHE THAT IS KULTURA?!?!***
- First of all they describe themselves as a tapas style restaurant. Okay seems appealing and like a nice idea but WHAT A FAILURE it really is.
- Sun dried tomato naan ($10) was chewy and tough in ways that a flaky and airy naan bread should NOT be. 
- Ahi Tuna Cornets ($14). One would think for something raw they wouldn't be able to mess it up. Think again. They smother the tuna in so much sauce that any taste of the fish is gone. Whatever happened to respecting the ingredients? Not to mention that the tuna was chopped so tiny that mixed in the sauce you wouldn't even know you had a protein in there. And then the bloody cornets that they're in?!?! I understand what they're trying to do is play with the idea of contrasting flavours; to juxtapose an ingredient with it's opposite as to bring out the best in both...but it just wasn't executed well at all. The hardness of the cornet shell with the texturally soft but overpowering flavour of the tuna/sauce was jarring. 
- Beef carpaccio. One of my favourite dishes...but NOT from here. It's raw. It should be a no brainer but apparently not. First of all, it came THICK and just slightly pink in the centre so obviously it was cut from a piece of meat that has been sitting around for a while and not actually raw. Good carpaccio should be so thin that it cooks itself at room temperature. Apparently our cow had sunbathed quite a bit before going on the plate. VERY big disappointment. 
- Seared scallops ($18). Three pieces. Saving grace is that the size was good and it was cooked well. Not raw. Not overcooked. Just right. Unfortunately, once again they try to do just too darn much and smothered the scallops in overpowering herbs and sauces. Rather than bringing out the flavour of the scallop, it completely masked it. 
- Sesame Oil Hamachi ($14). Same old Kultura story. Too much going on. Hamachi is a beautiful fish with a very distinct flavour that is completely masked and butchered here.
- Sushi pizza ($13). In my opinion, sushi pizza is not something that can be done easily. It runs the easy risk of being overcooked. At least Kultura hit the mark on that one. Kultura over-fries the rice so that it's so crunchy that it gets stuck in your teeth and is pretty much inedible. If you need a tooth pulled, come to Kultura: their sushi pizza is bound to pull out a few for you and then some. 

BOTTOM LINE: Kultura tries to be something it's not. It's not exciting. It's not new. It's not fine dining. It tries to be with it's decor and service (a la dish description) but it falls so short in its culinary skills that you're better off going somewhere else...like Canoe or Pangaea where service matches food. THAT'S fine dining. Not Kultura.",2

As per the Owners Response. I did mention above I used a TravelZoo voucher. The owner mentions that no bill was bought to the table. He is correct, we already paid $49 for the voucher, so more than 3/4 portion of it was already paid for. My comment was for the food alone, I would like to point out is the Salmon was RAW inside, not medium rare. As far as I know in Ontario food must be cooked well unless advised by the customer (for steaks, etc).

When we got our drinks her very berry was clear (normally is the berry color with actual berries in it) we have never got it like this before and obviously is not what she wanted , its understandable  that they are out of berries how ever we were never told this while placing our order , so we told the guy in a nicely maner if we could switch it becuase she didn't want it like that. This guy got so mad in a minute and said ""it taste the same"" and we said we understand that but she likes the actual fruit. He snatched from her hand and again said ""it tastes the same but whatever"" . Once he gave us the drink we asked if there was the a price difference and he said no and slammed the window close.

When the owner is there the vibe is great, she is friendly and attentive. the two times I went in there when she wasn't around, was a different world. One time the bar tender demanded that I spend at least $20 if I was going to use my debit card. I had stopped in for a nightcap many times before and this had never been an issue. the second time we walked in 45 minutes before closing and we were told that they were not going to serve any more drinks because it was slow and they wanted to go home, even though there were three people sitting at the  bar who were ordering a round as we walked in. As I am a home owner less than two blocks away I was hoping to make this my local hang but after feeling very unwelcome twice, I will look else where. This is unfortunate as I really loved the energy in this place. If you have a hip enough appearance to appease the bartenders, you may have a better experience.",2

Ordered: Small Jerk Chicken w/chicken gravy and coleslaw

This is definitely enough food for lunch (unless you have a huge appetite and are used to really big lunches). They fire roast their chicken and then let it sit in the sauce after so the flavors really soak in. I prefer this place over The Jerk Joint

I haven't tried anything else yet but my coworkers swear by the Curry Goat, and the Curry Goat Gravy on their Jerk Chicken

Other reviews are correct in that the service is not the friendliest, sometimes I don't know if the guys are talking to me or not haha but who cares when all you really want is some good take out Jerk chicken?? :)

Ice machine stopped working on our last day, but they were offering ice still at the front desk. Pool was great and clean, well landscapes outside, staff was friendly.

It seems that everything is always on sale - on top of their already low prices.  The staff is friendly and helpful, and the lines aren't usually too long.

There is also a Sephora in this location, which is pretty cool if you need perfume or make up.  The shoe department has seen better days, but what do you want?!  They also recently remodeled the home section, and it has a pretty cool vibe.

Their pizzas are delicious and inexpensive compared to what you would pay at Pizza Nova or even Pizza Pizza. A large deluxe pizza can cost you $15.00 and you get three sodas or your chose or sauces. The only thing that I would like to see is them including pizzas with the cheese crusts but that might be too fancy for a place like this.

Having said that, I would give them two stars for their establishment. Every time that I go there to pick up my pizza, I see the same guys sitting around drinking and being loud and they completely ruin the atmosphere. If the owner is reading this, please ban these people or put a limit on alcohol purchases so that we can eat our food in peace because until then I am always going to take my food to go.

4751,1,1548547200000,"If you're a Illini fan you just might want to stay here. This hotel is located about a quarter of a mile away from where they play football and their basketball arena is a mere stones throw away. Granted, if this is during basketball and football season, this closeness might be a good or a bad thing depending on what you are here for, I could see it being a massive traffic nightmare to be honest. It opened in August '08 so it still has that brand new smell when I stayed here this past weekend.

It has some really nice features, flat screens tvs, a very green environmental vibe going on, extremely friendly and over the top helpful customer service. One night when a friend and I went out to a bar and left our cars at the hotel, we asked about getting a cab. The front desk manager informed us it would be fairly expensive and told us he would drive us to the bar. Um.. okay. Always smiling and willing to help. They have cards that you can leave on the bed if you don't want or need your bed linens changed in an effort to save some energy on cleaning them over and over again. I like that. Also their light bulbs are energy efficient. The alarm clock in the rooms have a feature in which you can dock your ipod and wake up to it or play it like speakers. The room was great, comfortable and quiet. Prices were fairly affordable, but then again, I am also slightly comparing to Chicago prices.

There are a few things that can be tweaked though. In their fitness center, perhaps towels or something to wipe down when someone gets sweaty. It would be nice to have some stability balls, and a little more equipment. I am being picky but it was pretty bare bones in there. And I know they want to be a little greener, perhaps having a water fountain in or by they gym. Maybe there was one and I didn't see it. They do provide water bottles of Aquafina, but I think the water fountain would cut down on the use of plastic. Also, some recycling bins around the hotel and gym to recycle those bottles would be great too. 

For a first time visit to the town, I definitely would recommend staying here, however, do make sure when you do, check on when the games are being played, the traffic and congestion might interfere with your plans.",2

My boss decided to treat us all for lunch so I looked for something that appealed to me. I must admit that the menu scared me at first. It's definitely more of an upscale kind of place, but not quite a ""suit & tie"" affair. I settled on the bacon and turkey club. Seemed safe. 

I didn't think it was anything amazing. Yes, I said it. I've been looking forward to eating here, too! The sandwich was just sort of... plain. The sauces were bland and did nothing for me. It all just seemed very dry. Aside from the tasty bread and bacon, I wasn't too impressed. For a cheaper price, I could have ordered a club sandwich from a mom and pop's greasy spoon and been more satisfied. 

I also ordered a salad which consisted of lettuce and beets. Dressing was okay, but a little tangy. 

All in all, I'd like to return and actually enjoy a meal in the restaurant. Atmosphere does a lot for a place so a trip back is definitely in order. Also, I'd like to actually study the menu and ask some questions to make sure I can order something good. At work I was a little rushed to make a decision.

This is an old house that has been converted into a bar with a games room upstairs.  Pretty laid back atmosphere here, complete with bar booths and funky seating and wall covered photos and quirky bar objects.

Music was really laid back here, just loud enough to provide atmosphere but low enough so we could listen to our conversation.  Really sensational wait and bar staff, really attentive, casual and so eager to make our stay an enjoyable one.  The kitchen was closed so I can't write about the food but I did have a nice Kailua and milk cocktail that didn't have much bite but was good enough for 7 bucks.  Others at my table were enjoying their brews and although I don't drink beer I would drink it here if I could.

The place attracts young hipsters in their twenties and thirties and is a perfect place to just hang out.  It is a house from the turn of the century so it also has that paranormal feeling which makes your visit an even more engaging one...

Great location right in the middle of Gordon Square too. Now comes the most important part of the review... the food. This place has some of the best food I've tried in Cleveland for some of the best prices. The happy hour deal of a huge slice of pizza and a beer for $5 is hands down the best deal in the city. Seriously this slice is bigger than you can imagine and you can get every topping you want all for five dollars! Then the pulled pork platters are to die for. The meat and the bbq are unrivaled. Every time I come here I try something new and every time I come here I am always convinced I just had the best thing on the menu. The cheesesteak is mouth watering, the club sandwich is full of flavor, the burgers are mouth watering. Even the vegetarian options are all unreal (especially the tofu wrap!).

It was a mellow night when we went. The parking lot of the plaza sucks, but most Asian plazas are like that anyway. It wasn't crowded at all though, as we got a table right away.  

The menu offers an assortment of Japanese dishes along with your typical ramen with your choice of soup base. I went with the Tonkotsu Ramen. 

The ramen itself is decent. The soup was rich and flavorful. Cloudy just the way I like it. The noodles itself has a firmer texture, I prefer my ramen noodles softer. There were a few slices of chashu and half an egg. I had to order extra noodles to fill me up. 

I don't it beats any ramen joints in LA in terms of flavor. However it's pretty good for what you get in Vegas's Chinatown.",1

The inside is a little more modern and trendy-looking than the usual Charlotte pho joint, and everything's usually clean and pretty.  The menu is pretty standard. Things they do particularly well include the stuffed chicken wing appetizer, the pho, the vermicelli dishes with grilled meat, and the always-tasty young coconut juice.  They have an unusual (for around here) green papaya salad that's topped with peanuts and some kind of shredded dried meat.  Also good, if you're in the mood for that kind of thing, is the royal fried rice, which comes with chunks of every type of meat, plus pineapple.  The fresh rice noodle stir fries are good as well, but they're a lot for one person to eat.  I especially appreciate that they sell the pho in a ""little"" size that's about right for lunch, as well as the usual huge honkin' bowl you'd get elsewhere.  Make sure you get your pho with tendon for extra chewy goodness; I also have them substitute glass noodles for the rice noodles and have never had a problem with my noodles falling apart as one person mentioned.

So the food, if you lika da noodles, this is the place to go for cheap eating. I ordered a sour pork noodle dish because I love pork and pickled things. My gf ordered some kind of noodles that had peanut sauce in it. Of course hers was much better than mine, because... peanut sauce.

A while back I would have been satisfied with my pork dish, but after eating so many dishes rich with flavour and taste, I am a bit spoiled now. We both couldn't finish our dishes and we usually eat a lot so the portion is definitely good. I think we spent around $20 for both of us to eat. So great value for money.

They were is soooooo nice and pleasant. The techs are young but you can tell they are vested in the clinic and helping animals. My vet was Ms. Sashka. She was so gentle and through with the dog.

Given I only shared a pitcher I was told by my friend that she highly recommended the food and the menu boasted a few items that intrigued me but I wasn't planning on staying long so I opted out of munchies for this visit.

First and foremost I want to comment on the space alone; the sheer size of this place is impressive with a very intricate layout with plenty of nooks and crannies to tuck yourself away in. It seems like a very intimate setting that still has the convenience of a casual ambiance and the option of large tables and different areas for larger groups. The decor offers a coziness to the large and somewhat dimly lit venue, it has a very eclectic approach with some very unique features that would require a thorough walk through to fully appreciate.

4861,2,1546473600000,"I am reviewing this for their dance club atmosphere. I avoid eating at places like this because there are so many amazing chefs in Cleveland that bar food rarely becomes an option.
For the dancing though, this is always one of the most packed places. You can expect it to be wall to wall full of people, and you are trying to squeeze your way around. Sometimes it's not that bad, but that would probably depend a lot on the weather.  If there is a huge line to get in and it doesn't appear like they are letting anyone in, then they are really packed in here. However, if you're a girl, the bouncer told me that girls don't have to wait. So they do give you priority to get in, so you can try to walk right up to the bouncer to get in.
The dance floor isn't very big, and you get bumped into a lot while you're dancing. I usually see a lot of guys coming here, and they like to go on the stage in groups to dance and scope out their prey.
They do have a VIP section in the back that isn't too crowded and has a private bar, so you can get your drinks much quicker.

4912,1,1547337600000,"An unassuming restaurant's spin on Szechuan Hoi Sin, an opulent combination of lobster tails, weighty shrimp, fat scallops and various steamed and caramelized vegetables, somewhat reinvigorated my interest in Chinese cuisine weeks ago. 

As its name implies, Bridgeville's Classic Chinese Cuisine isn't bent on turning expectations inside out. A shopping center treasure of the suburbs, CCC just does the usual things well in a modest setting. 

Take for instance their plump, moist-as-meatloaf pork dumplings or their egg rolls, each of which are a cornucopia in a deep-fried potsticker. Both the former and latter were so exuberantly appetizing, we doubled our orders, nearly allowing them to wholly comprise lunch for us.   

Fortunately, I managed to save room for the aforementioned Szechuan Hoi Sin, a dish so prodigious in terms of portion size, it could have fed two or three guests. Alas, I needed a box for half of it, and it still managed to enthrall the next day, even after a spell in the microwave.

I can't bestow a full 5 rating to CCC since I wasn't exposed to anything I haven't had before in another permutation. Facing facts, this was the same veggies-with-a-protein-rice-and-a-sauce I've had all too many times, and I kept getting the vague feeling that had I ordered an entree with poultry or beef, ennui would have overcome me. Nonetheless, the Szcehuan Hoi Sin was an oceanic dazzler ornately presented. 

It doesn't need to be stated that the Pittsburgh area is overrun with dinky, takeout-only Chinese joints, but if a case for the sit-down Chinese meal with fancy silverware, white tablecloths, and dapper, professional servers is to be made, Classic Chinese Cuisine is the most persuasive and passionate of advocates.",2

The staff was friendly - a bunch of young girls working last weekend - however my only ""negative"" comment is that they spent most of the hour and a half we were there chit chatting and also talking to a group of their friends who stopped by, therefore not paying much attention to clients.

4956,1,1548028800000,"I had read a review by a friend of mine and was intrigued. At the least, it could only be the second worst thing I've ever had in my mouth.

Maui Dog is a quaint ""beachside"" place on Indian School, between 35th and 36th Streets. Surfer decor and a raw ceiling of asbestos and water stains create a charm not seen outside the area with the highest murder rate in Phoenix.

Trusting the counter girl, who was confused at my ""aloha,"" she suggested a straight ""Maui Dog"" with Tater Tots and I also wanted to sample the ""Spam Slider.""  I'm still not convinced it wasn't a sexual-act list she was offering me for $10. What a bargain THAT would be!

The dog is quite tasteless which allows for the mix of spicy chipotle mayo and the coconut-mango-pineapple dressing on top to take over...except for the large-ass bun masking that, too. The bun was bulky and dry and felt like it would revert to sawdust at any moment. I'm guessing it's authentic to the islands, where old hippies move to only discover toilet paper is $12 a roll.

The Spam Slider was a teaspoon of meat on a bun the size of my head and some island mix thrown on the top. I will not be ordering that again. Best advice...get the three-slider special and put all the meat and topping on one bun...and hollow out the bun...and still count on a lot of bread after that.

What was left of my tots, which weren't dropped on the filthy tray by ""Shakes"" the friendly waitress, who I believe had just sampled some Maui-Wowee out in the parking lot, were okay. Crispy but it's hard to ruin tots.

Get a ""Shave Ice"" for desert and ooze sticky sweat for two days. BTW - it's ""Shave Ice"" and not ""Shaved Ice."" If you'll excuse me, it's my day to shaved my ""lower 48.""

All in all, I'd go back!

The reviews are IN!

Yes, some people had opposing viewpoints and didn't agree with my review.

Kyle, who has not written any reviews, or most probably a legible sentence in his life, wrote me to say;

""in regards to your lude review i thaught the bread was great sweet but not overwhelming the spam sliders are awsome and need to be cut like that for flavor ratio.. as for the dogs very flavorfull i suggest just getting a plain beef brat or your choice and taste it own its own. and as the shaky waitress i dont know what to tell you maybe you expect to much fromm highschoolers this isnot flemings in dcranch the cealing once agian iv looked hard no asbestos..for one that wouldnt pass code and no water stains your vision might need to be tested and the highest murder rate i def know its not if you where a local or knew ne thing about phoenix youd know that tempe person if your going to write a review good or bad you shouldnt drag your  imature ideals into it . by the way the girl at the desk is 16 pedophile"" (sic)

Lizzie, who has also not written any reviews and who should not be allowed into a restaurant without a bag over her head...in fact, everyone in the restaurant should have one, too, in case her bag slips off, writes in a late-night, probably drunken message to me;

""You couldn't be a meaner person. I have been there many of times and know that everything you just said is completely false. I also am just curious how you can still sleep at night when you are such a mean person to others. Imagine what the waitress is thinking after reading that. You are an arrogant pig and I think you should find other hobbies other than being being a fucking asshole. Fuck you and goodnight.""

As a professional writer, I welcome opposing opinions as long as people understand I'm entitled to my own. Good night and don't forget to tip your waitperson!

She made sure everything was perfect for our event, right down to helping us decorate the private room (which took almost 4 hrs. but looked beautiful when finished!) and attending to our every need. Our three servers, (Spencer, Evan and Amy) were excellent and the food was delicious. All of our guests had a wonderful time and the evening was a huge success!

She didn't even come up and say I'll be with you just a moment, but in stead rolled her eyes at me. Waited 30 mins to finally get to order food. So I place a huge order. Came back serval time to see if my food was ready and she was like the cooks are mad at me and it'll come out. I kept seeing people go by and and getting there food first. Thought that she forgot to put in my order. I went back again to see if it's ready it's been 3hrs. I'm not kidding by the way. They are about to close. I asked for the manager, and waited again. So I played bj and see how it goes. Took the manager 40 mins to see me to resolve issue. So they came up with a plan for the next time I come I have two entree, appetizer, and free dessert on them.

4965,1,1546473600000,"I tried this salon based off of the reviews. One review said, ""You get what you pay for"". She was correct. I typically pay around $40 for a gel manicure that takes about 45 minutes to do & they usually last about 3 weeks before I see any chips or they grow out too much. I paid $30 here for a gel manicure that took 25 minutes total. One week later my nails look horrible; chips, breaks & unsightly grow out. 

The man that did my manicure was not personable at all.  There was no language barrier because I heard him speaking great English. He was just extremely lacking in any kind of customer service. He rushed through my manicure & didn't even push back my cuticles, hence the ugly grow out between my cuticles & where the gel polish starts. 

On a good note, the place is very clean & they do have a lot of beautiful colors to choose from. Too bad the pretty colors I chose only lasted one week. There are a lot of different nail salons in the North West area & this one is not worth trying, even at the inexpensive price. You get what you pay for!",2

4988,3,1546992000000,"Making our way to the restaurant we discovered that Tako was out of business and replaced with a new sushi place Matsuda. Like a lot of new restaurants there was a lot of attention to style and design. The entrance was moved from the side to the front of the building facing out to Don Mills road. The entry consisted of lots of glass and a large Japanese drum. Behind this the actual restaurant was really dark with stone walls and lots of pinspot lighting. Along the back wall was the sushi bar with all the sushi chefs visible to the restaurant. There was selection of tables separated by short walls and a couple of teppanaki tables in separate rooms at the front of the restaurant. Before being seated we were asked if we were there for all you can eat, something that is being adopted by all sushi places across Toronto. Because none of us were that hungry we opted for the a la carte menu, but changed our minds when we saw the prices. The AYCE was priced at $ 28.00 dollars per person, with a la carte options priced seemingly to make the AYCE more attractive. So in the end we opted for the AYCE based solely on price. 

The service was at time abrupt and other times just plain rude. Unlike other AYCE places where you order dim sum style on a sheet of paper, this place wanted you to order from the menu through the wait staff. This meant as customers you were dependent on the server coming back to the table and taking your orders. This would be fine if the service was attentive. Sadly, too often we had to flag someone down who then made us feel like we were making their life difficult. But as they say, the proof is in the pudding. Sadly, in the end, the food was disappointing and not worth the high price.

AYCE restaurants are never known for the quality of their food and my expectations were low, but Matsuda disappointed even these low expectations. Too often the food that arrived bore no relation to how it was described in the menu. The standout misnomer, was a golden scallop that turned out to be a tiny pumpkin soufflé with a small bay scallop hidden at the bottom of the ramekin. It was too say the least, odd. Another disappointment were the grilled Jumbo shrimps which turned out to be extra small shrimps. By the end of the meal we found ourselves, the absurdity of the place had us and the table beside us laughing at the place. There was nothing really to do but sit back and laugh at a place that will not last very long.",2
4990,3,1546732800000,"We came here tonight after a concert at Comerica. We got there at 11:45p. Well before closing time. We had the ""security"" midget tell us that we couldn't come inside.

Simple. Two tacos, bean dip and two drinks. Meanwhile, they are closing up all around us. Making us feel extremely uncomfortable and kicking everyone out that is hanging out on the patio. We decide to eat our food quickly since we are made to feel like we are an inconvenience. I have my cup of ice. Which is my old drink. I step outside with my cup. I have the midget security come out, knock my cup of ice out of my hand, and tells me that I'm costing the venue their liquor license. It's because of people like me that he can't be nice. He did me a favor by letting us in. Really?? He continues to talk shit to me until he walks away. Worst experience ever. And I have been coming to this venue since it opened.

Hope you only need one round because after waiting 30 minutes to try to order a second round we paid with exact change to save us from wasting another hours of our life.   It is hard to explain how oblivious the bar tenders were.,2
4996,1,1547856000000,"Small hidden little gem.

I was out running errands and stumbled upon this delight. Everything I ate, which felt like too much while ordering, turned out to be perfect. They have $5.00 tapas, hard to choose which ones to pick. I had a baked cheesy scallop (my apologies for not remembering the correct name) and seared ahi. I wanted a roll as well so they accommodated my request for a Las Vegas roll even though it was not on the menu (and yes I know I really should venture out, but it sounded perfect, and it was). Pictures to follow. 

The only things that turned me off were the laminated ""lunch specials"" (as an industry person, I feel like at a certain price point laminated menus are not acceptable) and no wine specials for lunch, only Sake. Again I understand in a Japanese restaurant I should drink Sake but I like what I like, and might I add my Prosecco complemented my meal perfectly.

I had the house enchiladas with grilled chicken and that was delicious.  The rice and beans left something to be desired.  Husband had the pork green chile mac and cheese which he enjoyed but felt was underseasoned.    

I ordered the peach sangria on the recommendation of a friend but found it to be too wine-y for me.  I was expected a glass full of fruit as is customary and there was one tiny lone piece of peach clinging sadly to the bottom of the glass.  The waiter was kind enough to swap it out for the passionfruit sangria which I enjoyed much more.  I also tried the blood orange mojito and the coconut mojito.  They were both fabulous and LARGE!  If it were up to me, I'd make them slightly less sweet but they were still fantastic nonetheless.  

We shared the macadamia nut brownie and ice cream for dessert and that was wonderful.  The brownie was sort of like the bastard child between cake and a brownie.  Denser than cake, not as dense as a brownie.

5011,3,1547337600000,"My girlfriend and I came here on a Saturday 2 weeks ago for our first anniversary. I made reservations over a month in advance which I think ended up being a solid decision. We arrived slightly earlier than 7, but were seated right away as the restaurant had not filled up yet. By the time we left, the entire place was full and was a mad house. We were seated in the center of the restaurant and I was very happy I got a booth seat. 

Our waitress almost instantly came over and introduced herself, poured us water, and took our drink order. My girlfriend had been eyeing out their pitchers of Sangria when we peeked at the menu twice a day, every day the week leading up to this special day. The white sangria is not overly sweet, has great flavors, but is not worth the price they charge for the quantity you get. We were able to fill out goblets (8oz or so) maybe 2-3 times each including ice. Since it was our anniversary, we splurged and eventually ordered a second but this definitely jacked the price of our bill in the end. 

Our waitress advised us prior to ordering our meals that they recommend 5-6 small plates to have a filling meal. We somewhat obliged and ordered 4 small plates, and a large dish to split for our entree. First we received the Palacios Chorizo and the Croquetas De Jamón. The chorizo was a small portion, but was cured meat goodness. The Croquetas we probably our favorite small plate of the meal. Perfectly crispy on the outside, creamy and cheesy on the inside. After we finished the portion of 3 we instantly wished we had about 20 of them lined up in front of us. Our second round of small plates came out shortly after the first round and were the Empanadas De Carne Mixta and a Meatball special they had that night. I honestly was not overly impressed with either. The Empanadas we baked instead of the usual deep fried which was a major bummer. Meatball I have high standards for; these were close to being good, but the sauce and the texture of the meatball fell just short. Finally our entree arrived about 10 minutes after we finished the second round. We agreed on the Paella De Bogavante Y Gambas which fair warning (and the waitress informs you of this as well) takes 45 minutes to an hour to prepare. If you go through the amount of small plates we did, this wait seems insignificant. The was a close second to the Croquetas in my opinion. The lobster and gulf shrimp (served head and shell on) tasted incredibly fresh, and my girlfriend could not stop saying ""I've never had seafood this good!"" The rice itself was very flavorful, but buyer beware; if you go through as many small plates as we did there is NO WAY you will come close to finishing this. Lastly we decided to close our meal with the Churros that I've read so much about. I had casually mentioned to our waitress at the start of the meal that we were there for our anniversary, and surprise surprise, she remembered (see picture). These were also very delicious and we probably could have ate a few more, but then we would have been going over board.

In conclusion, I could only justify giving this place 4 stars. This is 100% due to the cost to portion ratio. All items on this menu are highly over priced compared to the amount of food that you receive, as well as the previously mentioned sangria. Cost aside, this is some of the best service I have ever experienced at a restaurant, and the vast majority of food was on point. I probably will never be back due to the fact that I live in Buffalo, but I will be sure to recommend to a friend that is looking for a place for a special occasion while in Toronto!",2

The Buffalo chips appetizer was a close second (homemade chips, gorgonzola sauce, buffalo sauce and blue cheese). I had the fish po' boy. It was good, but could have benefited from some more flavor. Lemon? Not sure. Something was missing. My husband had the carnitas cemita. He liked it but he felt it was missing something too. It was a little dry, could have used some tang. The roasted corn slaw was a disappointment.  Not much corn in it and the flavors arent quite there. Maybe it could use some cilantro, salt and lime juice? We had a smores dessert. It was only ok. Overall it was ok. We were disappointed because it seems like their food is lacking some flavor.  This location is on its third restaurant.  I hope they kick up their flavor so they can stay.

When the food finally arrived it wasn't right. We ordered a kids bean and cheese burrito and they failed to put the beans in the burrito.

As soon as we walked in, a friendly employee handed us a menu to review before ordering. My friend and I both ordered the Kickback chicken biscuit with the charred corn salad as our side. Needless to say our taste buds were overjoyed with the balance of the goat cheese and pepper jelly. The chicken itself was also very well seasoned. 

An important note is that the charred corn salad isn't mayo-based. It's actually greek yogurt instead which makes it a little healthier but still so flavorful! 

The biscuit itself was moist and there was enough left after eating the chicken to enjoy with one of the spreads available. We tried the raspberry, blackberry, and the pepper jelly. The raspberry and blackberry are more like preserves than jam if that matters to you. 

The caramel latte served as a nice finish to my breakfast. While the focus isn't on coffee the foam art was a very pleasant surprise. This may have been my first visit but it's certainly not my last.",3

5070,2,1548115200000,"My first session for QHHT was with Jaclyn. I did not know what to expect and as like most people I have a preconceived notion of hypnosis. After Jaclyn discussed my questions and thoughts we began. She then put me in to a dream like state and the information began to flow. Let me also give some background on myself so that you can better understand me. I have been on opioid and other pain medication for over 8 years. I have other symptoms as well that go along with the chronic pain and have not been able to work full time during this span. Needless to say I have tried many doctors of both western and non western approach. My main focus of the session was getting to the root of my pain problem and getting off of the pain medication.

Jaclyn was able to make the session flow and ask the right questions to help me move forward. I was impressed by her ability to make me relax and keep moving when we hit any stumbling blocks. After the session I didn't feel any different however in the next few days things started to change. I did have healing crisis and I knew then my body was reacting to the  QHHT session. I feel it is important to mention that going over the session in a week or two is beneficial to getting the maximum results. New information can come to light that makes a difference after you have had time to absorb the experience.

Several months have gone by now since I write this and I am not sure if was the session or the with drawls from the opioid or both but things were a little rough for a while. I am now completely off of the opioid and my body is still healing. I have no doubt in the power of QHHT and even had my session muscle tested as to the effect. I don't know what the limitations are of a QHHT session however for me I know it got me the results I have been chasing for almost a decade.",2

The kitchen has basic (individual sized) packets of basic spices...and ice was already available with the ice maker. 

We enjoyed our stay.
A friend arranged for our stay when our home (in Las Vegas) was flooded. Worldmark made a terrible event into an experience that was much nicer and laid back.

5098,3,1548201600000,"I have been using Pair.com hosting for over ten years.  All of the websites of my small business are hosted on pair.  These range from small retail sites that receive a couple thousand visits per day to a large popular site that receives millions of visits per month (that means during busy times of the day several visitors per second will enter the site and hundreds of people will be simultaneously using the site).  With all of that traffic and development activity I have never had a problem with pair.  With all of that traffic and development activity if I was experiencing problems I would have moved off of their servers quickly- because downtime is very costly for a high traffic website or a busy retail website.

My sites are now on or have been on Pair's shared hosting, high volume, virtual private servers and dedicated servers.  I have received the same high quality of service at every level.  Across ten years with many websites, my sites have never (meaning not one single time) been down for more than a few moments while upgrades were done or drives were replaced.  

I have obtained support from pair many times by email and phone. Their email support is reasonably fast and support by phone is immediate and excellent.  The phone support is always with a person who speaks excellent English and also makes the technical details easy to understand.  

Anyone who has used multiple web hosting services will know that what I described above is exceptionally rare.

After spending 3 nights there I have to say I'm thoroughly impressed! The room I was in was huge and spacious with a nice king size bed and very clean... The hotel itself is gigantic! 

It has a movie theater, equestrian center (yeah they've got horse shows and rodeos here!!), a bowling alley (!) and a bunch of places to eat with some very reasonable prices. I got to eat at Baja Miguels (they had $2 Margaritas at the bar!!) and the Silverado Steak house and was impressed with the quality of the food. 

The gaming area is huge and I had the pleasure of losing at craps, blackjack and slots but still had a great time!! 

They also hook you up with some nice freebies at checkin. (like drink coupons!) 

You could literally spend your whole day her and never leave the freaking premises!

The only real negative is that it's about a 10 minute drive from the strip but in my old age I'm not so inclined to hang out there and deal with the  rowdy crowds.

The Olive Garden staff seemed well trained and equipped for emergency.  They handled the situation in calm manner and got the paramedics right away.  I noticed their attention to care, which I knew would be similar once we went inside.

Indeed, the experience was a good one.  Our waiter tried to be a funny guy and crack some witty humor, which I appreciate.  We started off with a Grilled Chicken flatbread appetizer.  My only complain was that it was too cheesy, but I guess that is expected when you use an alfredo type suace.  I got the chicken scampi and my roommate and his got the Tour of Italy.

Instead of bread, they bring you a basket of little breads, muffins and pastries. We didn't eat all of them, but got them to give us a doggy bag for late night snacks. 

The Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale was soooooo good I'm still dreaming about the sauces it came with. 5 star dish all the way!

We also got the Tuna ""Nachos."" These aren't really nachos - they give you small tortilla potato chips basically you use to scoop up the raw chunks of tuna and the two sauces it comes with - a habanero sauce that wasn't too spicy and an avocado crema.

Also, we ordered the Shrimp Tacos. They were delicious - I don't know what Bobby Flay puts in those sauces (other than copious amounts of butter) but I can't get enough.

They have a train ride and they charge $2 per person... Literally! So if you have a small child who can't ride alone, they will not let you ride with your small child with 1 ticket... Even though you're only taking up 1 seat, they make you pay for two tickets. That was ridiculous. Especially because it's not like you're taking up two bucket seats, just 1 seat with your small child/baby. 

I had to sit my 2 year old with his older cousin since I didn't buy a ticket to ride with him. 

I can understand if you're taking up two seats or if your child is older, but for the children who are small like my 2 year old, I think it was just them taking advantage of their customers. They need to be sure they explain that when you buy tickets. 

Otherwise we like the place, my kids and my nieces had a blast last Saturday when I treated a party of 9 of us. 
They have a blob to bounce on - 15ppl allowed at a time for about 10-15 minutes. So if you go on a weekend, expect lines. No fee.

They have a track to race trikes -no fee.

Petting all the animals- fun and free but if you want to feed them make sure you take lots of quarters to get pellets. You only get a small handful each .50 you use in the machine. The kids loved it. They also keep hand sanitizer near by and have a hand washing station by the exit.

They have the corn mazes, even a small one of you don't want to spend an hour in the large one. Cool.

Two bouncy houses as well, free but not monitored well... Kids can get pushy so keep an eye on your kids if it's a busy day.

They have a cool tire area and a spider web that the kids enjoyed climbing on. Again, supervise your own kids to make sure others aren't being too pushy.

They have a cool play house with a fun tunnel slide and a couple corn boxes for the kids to play in. A couple large sitting areas and a place to buy kettle corn, drinks and other food as well.

Overall you'll probably enjoy the place, just prepare for the extra costs. :)

Happy Fall Y'all!

She always makes everyone feel so welcomed, at home, and always greets you with a smile on a first name basis. The one quality that stands out the most for me is watching Pat interact with her employees, she always treats them with the upmost respect and as an equal. She again always greets them too with a friendly hello and that truly makes the environment of the restaurant so much happier. If there is ever a problem with our order, Pat never thinks twice about it and has it fixed immediately. She always puts the customer first and makes sure their experience is the best it can be. She also leads her Wildflower with amazing community events, she knows the importance to be a stand out citizen in representing Wildflower and its generosity. She is outstanding. This kind of customer service is what makes her stand out and it should be recognized. I hope Wildflower knows and appreciates her they way we do.

It's not the best Indian food you'll ever eat, but it is pretty darn tasty just the same. I live for their saag. The naan is freshly made and so good I've never bothered getting any other roti. The gajar ka halwa is also dreamy. Soooo sugary and soooo buttery. The food isn't terribly hot-spicy but I find it's increased in heat a little over the last couple of years. The excellent part is that for like 7 bucks you get three veg dishes of your choice, roti, rice, dessert, and pickle. It leaves you stuffed. Way better than most buffets for a lot less money. 

The other handy thing about this place is that you can pick up all manner of sweets to take home for your diabetic coma needs. One can never have enough jalebi or burfi in my opinion. Anyway, if you are hungry in Etobicoke or looking for a nice long bus ride then I highly recommend this place.",2

What I didn't like about the Flamingo: 

Their Poker Room- It is pretty old school and seemed to be used mostly by locals which are not normally that fun to play with.

Their Elevators - Very slow and old.

Their Restaurants - Nothing that really caught my eye.

Internet - 14.99 a day (WTF?)

What I liked about the Flamingo:

Their Location - The Flamingo is located a short walk from my favorite poker room at the Venetian and across the street from Ceasar's. I made great use of the location.

Their Rooms- The room was very nice and even thought the decor was a little funky  thought it was very comfortable for the price. 

I think I might stay their again.",2

5279,1,1546819200000,"Do not recommend. We tried everything on the menu as we were a group of 5. 

The fixed price includes 4 courses, 2 of which you can choose from 2 options. The entree Crab, yogurt and carrots and the Hen of the woods are the same for everyone. You then have the choice of Halibut OR Guinea hen for main, and the Cheese plate OR the Blackberry ice cream cake for dessert.

The hen of the woods was VERY salty. We spent a lot of debating whether the chef actually tastes the plates before sending them out because it was so salty that it was difficult to eat without the bread. 

Overall, the combination of flavors was very odd for 2 courses out of the 4 courses: Halibut, sea urchin and potatoes, and the Cheese, pickled dry eggplant and mashed white beet.

Halibut, sea urchin and potatoes was covered with an orange sauce that tasted very odd: it had this sour tasting undertone that is similar to expired seafoods/meats. Not to mention that the sauce completely overpowers the taste of the Halibut: no way of telling how fresh the fish was.

Cheese, pickled dry eggplant and mashed white beet was underwhelming: we had our share of dry and pickled eggplants so it's nothing new to us and the cheese (by itself) was actually pretty good, but the combination of flavor was not just working for us.

The guinea hen, the blackberry ice cream dessert, and the Crab entree was pretty good. 

The presentation of the mains can also use some improvement: the entire plate was covered by green leaves and juste don't look like appetitive.

We eat out fairly often and tried most of the hip and fine dinning places in Montreal. This is one of our least favorite ones.",2

We walked into the restaurant and were greeted with a smoky atmosphere. This place is definitely the college go-to place for a Sammy! My boyfriend got the pitts-burger and I got the Capone. The pitts burger is this weird meatloaf-ish patty which was pretty disappointing as it was one of the most talked about sandwich. The only saving grace for the sandwich was the fact that it was stuffed with french fries and coke slaw. The Capone was wayyyyy better! Get this Sammy if you come here! I love the combo of the hot sausage with the cold cole slaw. Personally I think the fries were much and changed the texture of the sandwich.

The place is nice and big enough. There was no line and there were only three more couples beside us. Order was super fast (one star), they speak English, but the menu is in French, only the server has one in English (at least that was what happened in our case). 

I ordered a Double Kebab without a side and my husband ordered a Caesar Salad ($5). Funny enough that one came with a side of fries. Weird. The portions were too small for the price in my opinion. The Kebab especially. It's $8 and you get about 8 pieces of meat with nothing else, unless you pay another $3 for a side dish (rice, fries,...).

My eggs benny had gross spinach water stains (I hope!) on the plate, and the Hollandaise sauce seemed like it had been sitting on the eggs for a long time before they brought it out. The homefries were pretty good, but they were really salty. 

The water we got had stuff floating in it so it was a bit off-putting, making the salty homefries harder to consume.

A great BBQ variety (pork, beef, chicken), corn-on-the-cob, fluffy corn bread, crispy/ hot French fries and their wide variety of sweet, hot and tangy BBQ sauces that were to everyone's liking.

I called in for a take-out order just to save time. When I got there, they weren't done with my food but I didn't mind since I came about 10 minutes earlier than expected. But what impressed me was typically when I would order take-out at other restaurants and my food wasn't ready, I would just sit on the side and wait for it to be done. But with Sidestreet, not ONLY did they brought me water to drink while waiting, they also angled the TV towards my direction so I could watch it clearly while waiting. WOW!!!!!

The food was great and everything was reasonably priced! I've tried several items on their menu including:

Fresh Spring Roll with Grilled Pork: My first time ordering Spring Rolls that had grilled pork instead of shrimp!! To my surprise it's still very refreshing regardless of the grilled meat. I did opt out of the mint just so it's not too overwhelming

Wonton Soup: FYI this does NOT come with noodles but very tasty and filling nonetheless! It comes with several LARGE pieces of wonton so even without the noodles, you can easily consider this an entree. 

Lemongrass Chicken Rice Plate: So much bang for your buck! It also comes with shredded pork skin and an egg loaf

Grilled Chicken with Rice Noodle: basically like the rice plate except with noodles!

They did a pretty good job with the inside.  I have a dog, so I always need a little TLC on the back seat.  They vacuumed most of the hair, but didn't do a super thorough job.  Outside looked pretty good.

If your going to see and be seen in Charlotte (5 star) this is the mall. When you walk in you will be hit by a blast of aroma therapy waffing out of one of the stores to entice you to come in. I never knew a mall could smell so nice. There are lots of high end stores for those who scoff at those commoners stores such as Old Navy, Target, or heaven forbid TJ Maxx. Still love the Belks as a native of the area still can always find great deals there and great product lines. The restaurants are nice and spacious but you better have reservations for Cheesecake factory or Maggiano's or you will be waiting. 
Love that there is a Dick's sporting goods right next to the mall and the food court is busy especially during lunch hours on weekdays but all the places are clean and efficient.

We ordered the shishito peppers & cauliflower for appetizers and that was a good start to prepare my pallet for what we were expecting to come with the main dishes.  As well as the viviana 12 cocktail was amazing and gave an instant buzz.  

For our main meal we ordered the garlic shrimp from the daily specials board and also the kimchi fried rice with pork belly off the regular menu.  The flavor and taste of the garlic shrimp was mediocre and did not satisfy my taste buds.  The kimchi fried rice seemed to have too much vinegar and souriness.   The pork belly was sort of bland and didn't have the seasoning I was expecting.

The one thing I will say about their pizza is that I don't love their crust or their pizza sauce, but at least half of the specialty pizzas come with an alternative sauce- I recommend the Greek pizza and the Thai chicken pizza.  The pizza is very yummy when it's hot, but it doesn't seem to keep all that well (it can be very juicy).  The salads are all great too, but I haven't been impressed by their pasta.

While I was waiting, I went to the bathroom and I noticed that the bathroom was not as clean as it should be as it reflects a sanitary dental practice.  I am a neat freak and this was a little disturbing as it reminded me of a dirty bathroom at a restaurant .... If I were in charge of the office, I would have someone periodically clean the bathrooms, the waiting area, and the also the floors in the individual rooms where the treatment is being done.

As for the dental staff, I was very pleased with Dr. Fernandez.   She was kind, thorough, and positive and Sandy was very gentle with my X rays.  The doctor went through all my X rays and spent time to talk with me about my teeth as well as educated me about my treatment options without any pressure. I could tell she really cared!

CONS: pricey for what you get, especially the spa pedicure which is the massage and all of the frills that make it the more expensive one; it lasts less than 25 minutes and that includes exfoliating, massaging, cutting, sanding and nail polish!! It is so fast, you barely have time to really sit back and enjoy it. 

Also, it is ALWAYS PACKED when I go so I strongly advise making an appointment ahead of time.

I injured myself trying to move all my stuff by myself and used their movers service to hire someone to help. The company (Monsoon Movers) hadn't called or contacted the day I scheduled that job nor did they call the following day and I called Uhual to tell them and they offered a free one day/24 hour extension while I tried to find someone else. Unfortunately, it was Labor Day so no one was working but the other company I got called me immediately after I made the schedule and showed up first thing the next day. I returned the van almost three hours prior to the deadline which means I should've only been charged for two days but got charged for FOUR days. Also, rental tax is 13.05%!? Fine, then I should've only been charged, mileage and environmental fees included, $76.10 but was charged $145.85!

The may tag blue cheese was creamy and the burger was cooked perfectly, nice and juicy, it was a little messy but sometimes the best foods are! 

Also, for not accepting reservations they were able to get us in quick at 6 o clock on a Friday night, unheard of for the downtown Gilbert area.  Our waiter was great and the hostesses were awesome, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my boyfriends burger was a little under seasoned- but all in all a great burger joint with great drinks and a cool inviting area.",2

The food is fine, I had the short ribs which were slightly salty for me, but honestly everything is a bit heavy on the salt for my strange palate. The wine by the glass list was surprisingly robust, which I appreciate - most places have bleh wines for single pours, and often times I'm the only lush at the table and can't go for a bottle (I don't think restaurants let you take leftover wine in a sippy cup to go). Service was nice, no complaints.

The inside is cute with comfortable and a little funky in decor. Just be prepared to whip out your phone for the flashlight if you want to read the menu after sundown cuz it's dark, as my fellow Yelpers have mentioned (hence no Instafood pictures). The location is what really makes this place TBH - love this little Old Town neighborhood, which has such a cozy, fun feel and so different from my usual LA landscape. 

All in all, a pretty safe bet if you're with people with a variety of tastes or folks you don't know well enough to be decisive on a specific cuisine, type of venue, etc.",2

My meal came with toast and had to hunt down a server to get butter then had to wait five minutes to get butter with no apology or excuse from the server. Then I turned the toast over and noticed it was burnt to a crisp and inedible. Because our server was so hard to get a hold of, I knew if I tried to get new toast my omelette would be cold by the time I would get it. I added avocado to my omelette and it was literally brown--very old. Why do they think it's ok to serve that?? Very meh, bad service and chefs that think it's ok to serve inedible food.",2
5519,2,1546732800000,"We had a great first experience here, despite a typo in the menu. The family combo says it includes the high end short rib cut but the Korean actually says it is a pork cut. With that out of the way, Hobak undoubtedly has the closest experience to ""authentic"" Korean BBQ in Las Vegas - and I just came from a vacation in Korea! 

Korean BBQ almost undoubtedly involves the use of charcoal. While Hobak isn't purely charcoal, it does include it in it's gas driven grill, and it does make a difference to the flavor. This hybrid combination means that the flavor of the meat is enhanced with a little more char. This alone sets them apart from all other Korean BBQ in Las Vegas.

The meat quality here is very good, comparable to DJK. Of course, that means that it is a little pricier than AYCE places, and while the combos have plenty of meat, you can't necessarily stuff your face here. That being said, we were completely satisfied with the amount of food.

One of the things to look at here is the way they decorate the interior. It has some fun elements that borrow from the Korean streets, including posters to old Korean movies and a ""storefront"" style butcher area. The butcher area here helps indicate that the cuts are fresh and that presenting the meat actually means something.

The dessert is a fun take on an ice cream sandwich using Korean rice puff snack instead of cookies.",2

There was one person getting treated and after 20 minutes, it was my turn.Suddenly lots of people came in... It could've been a long wait had I arrived an hour later.  Since it was 102 deg. outside, people seemed content waiting in an air conditioned place.

The doc came in, and said that an x ray was needed,  The MA was also the x ray tech and was quit good at explaining what I had to do.  It took no more than 10 min. for that.  He put a custom made splint on my wrist, explaining what he was doing and how to take care of it and my injury.   I kinda sweated waiting for results of the x ray. A fracture could mean a cat, surgery, and/or a long road.

It is literally a few minutes from my house which always a plus when dining out. The decor is minimal and the seats are too comfortable as they are just wooden bench seats but they make up for it in the food. 

Their menu is a double sided and has everything that you can think of. They even add some special rolls that are unique to their location, honestly not the best but it's something that sets them apart. 

They're pretty good at remember everything you ordered, unless you were talking too fast and they didn't catch it to write it down. The only down side is that if you go on a weekday for lunch, there's only one server and it's the owner and she doesn't speak English very well and when you order, order extremely slow but again everything does come.

5592,1,1546819200000,"Deagan's Kitchen has singlehandedly raised the bar for Gastropubs.

As a taco connoisseur, I opted to go for Taco Tuesday. Beef or Chicken tacos are $2, and Shrimp or Ahi Tuna tacos are $3. Since I love seafood tacos, I opted for 1 each of Shrimp and Ahi Tuna. The Shrimp taco came with white cheddar, guacamole and micro cilantro, while the Ahi Tuna came with soy chili glaze, Asian slaw and guacamole. Now, I've had a lot of fish/seafood tacos in my day, but I can say with confidence that these are among the best I've ever eaten.

For the main course, I had the Peking Duck Confit Mac & Cheese, which was absolutely, positively delicious. Served with shallots, Mahon cheese and English peas, it's full of meaty, cheesy deliciousness; comfort food raised to another level.

Both the menu and beer list are impressive, and it's obvious that both were created with a lot of thought and care. Also unexpected was the very good Charcuterie selection, something I wouldn't expect to see here, which is very refreshing.

The service was very friendly and prompt, and Deagan himself even came by our table for a visit.

Everything is priced very reasonably, considering the quality of ingredients and quality of the food itself.

I will definitely become a regular here. Lakewood should be proud to have Deagan's.",2

The decor was pretty cool, although I thought there were too many fish in the aquarium (on one of the press clippings outside the restaurant it said you could choose your own fish to eat - I hope they weren't talking about these cute little gold fish). As for the food we shared a small bowl of noodles with pork and mushrooms ($15), steamed pork buns ($10) and Vietnamese iced coffee ($6). The noodles were I guess hand made and actually quite tasty, but there was barely anything else in the bowl....just some sweet sauce, 2-3 slices of mushroom and 2-3 pieces of shredded pork/dried bacon. The buns were average - edible but nothing special. The coffee was good. The most exciting part of the meal was the fire...so midway through our lunch fire alarm went off. At first we thought it was just a test so we did not pay much attention to it and neither did anyone else (we experienced fire alarm test at Harrah's the day before). But then we heard overhead announcement saying ""please evacuate the building"" so we asked the waitress what was going on and she said ""don't worry, this happens all the time"". What, they have daily evacuations!? I don't think she understood the announcement so we asked her to please go outside and check it out (we were somewhat concerned, but apparently not so motivated to check it out ourselves). She came back reporting that everything was ok, but that we were free to leave if we wanted. No one else budged from their seats and so comforted by the crowd mentality we stayed. A few minutes later there was another announcement saying that fire had been contained and to return to our normal activity. So much for fire alarms.",2

2nd time I was there...my friend and I got our meal paid for by 40 drunk men participating in a Bacehlor party...she and I just wished we knew about it before we finished our meals.  We would have ordered a Kobe steak!

3rd time was a special treat.  Said friend and I finally treated Vegas the way it was meant to be treated!  And the employees at Stripsteak were more than happy to oblige.

To sum it up, we'll never go to Hayashi for sushi again.   We ordered a sashimi plate and it was very good - couple of pieces I sure didn't recognize, but all four servings were very good.  Then to the rolls - salmon skin rolls were not.  Not even according to the menu.  Neither was the hamashi (sp?) roll.  Both were not good, not made the way they were described and the seaweed was tough.  So that brings us to the spider roll.  It was ok, but the tough seaweed kinda took the fun away.

And the waitress was no help.  She admitted she didn't like fish and instead of taking care of replacement, she made 3-4 trips out to the sushi bar (if you go, don't sit in the back room) to get his side of the story.

5615,3,1547164800000,"I found the Wooden Vine by accident while exploring uptown (we are new to Charlotte.) My husband and I stepped in on a whim on a Saturday evening, and what good luck that we did. I loved the atmosphere, the menu (both food and wine) and found all of the staff to be engaging and knowledgeable. The size of the venue is perfect. Not huge or small by any means, but just right. The decor is organic and the atmosphere soothing.We left very pleased and I made a mental note to return, asap! 

So, I did.

On the last Saturday in April, I brought my book club here (around 10-14 women in total) to discuss the book of the month. Our server, Nina, was amazing! I had made the reservation in the days prior to our arrival and found management to be extremely accommodating. I have hosted groups of different sizes in restaurants before (in San Diego, where we just moved from) and found this to be by far the best experience. 

Fourteen women on different checks? No problem. I spent several years working in fine dining and was amazed at how Nina didn't even break a sweat. Everyone was so well attended to, we were able to completely focus on our discussion. I don't remember anyone wanting for anything. On top of this, the ladies raved about the atmosphere, the service, and the wine list and food were impeccable. On top of having the best server, the most accommodating management, the rest of the staff seemed equally personable. Another server stopped by our table several times, genuinely interested in our book club and sharing some very interesting tips on what he'd been reading. 

I shared a bottle of Cab with another lady (woo hoo!) and ordered the french soup dumplings- yep, I said it, dumplings! They were exquisite. The woman next to me had the cheese plate, and my friend ordered smoked tomato bisque. WOW. I've been dying for a legit foodie experience and I think I can safely say that we all walked away extremely satisfied.

The only complaint I have is that I don't live closer- otherwise I'd certainly be a regular. There is no doubt that I'll be back, with or without the book club!

Yes, they are a new business but that doesn't mean they should be pardoned by lack of service and food knowledge. Like most restaurants, they should've done a run through go over the kinks prior to opening. The workers are nice but not very knowledgeable when it comes to their menu. They keep having to go back to the kitchen to ask if they have certain things or if they offer substitutions. There is NO pho veggie option on their menu. You will have to ask. First time I ordered it they just gave me the broth with noodles, onions and cilantro. I had to ask where the other vegetables were and specify which ones I wanted in there. W.T.H.?? The second time it was a completely different dish. AND they charge the same amount of $ what their regular meat pho is when other places charge a dollar or two less. My mother in-law ordered their seafood soup and there was no shrimp. She asked where it was and they were confused so she had to show them the menu stating there is suppose to be shrimp.

First, in a 24-hour town like Las Vegas, any convenience store with a genuine interest in serving it's community needs to be open 24-hours... 7-Eleven is, Circle K is, Terrible's is, Rebel is, GV Mini Mart is NOT. Instead, out come the prison bars at closing time as if someone is going to break in and steal the candy bars. The prison bars on the window look HORRIBLE in our neighborhood, as do the ""South Central LA-esque"" cigarette ads stuck on the windows. As you walk in the door, you are greeted with a ""NO PUBLIC RESTROOM"" notice on the door. Mind you, I never used the restroom in the years it was 7-Eleven and I wasn't about to start, but the notice reinforced the notion that this business is here solely to extract as much money as possible from the community while driving down the image of our community with it's cheap liquor-store antics. ""Don't ask to use our restroom, it's only for ""us"", not YOU"". For the thousands of stores that 7-Eleven operates nationwide, they at least had nice people behind the counter who could carry a conversation that did not include the forlorning of ""Is that all you're going to buy?"" Solely profit driven. Do not misunderstand, I vote Republican but even I have my breaking point on ""Profit as a reason to exist"".

The place is just gross and unclean.

With regard to price. I'm not sure what is meant by ""prices aren't as steep"", but I walked in for a 44 ounce refill of soda...... $1.29, no kidding. Circle K, 79 cents, Rebel (Down the street) 79 cents. Both run by corporations, both with genuine people working there. 20 ounce bottle of Sprite? $1.69... about the same everywhere.

I was appalled at the rudeness but carried on. She told me she could fix it. We got our drinks and continued waiting. Another person then came up to the window and asked us what we were waiting for and I told him the donuts. He then told me there were no donuts on my order. I told him there's no way I went through each flavor I wanted at the ordering screen. He then magically found them and I was on my way. I don't think they charged me for the donuts which is a plus, but I would've rather paid double then have had to deal with their customer service. Not to mention the drink changed to over ice had about two ice cubes and tasted horrific.  So disappointing.",2

I was pleased that they have my favorite Eggs Benedict with salmon. The service is good and the food is great. The only downside is that the coffee is not included with your brunch and you have to pay for coffee in addition to your meal.

The portions are average, my Benedicts came with oven roasted potatoes (not super generous on potatoes) and some fruit. Nevertheless, the eggs and the sauce were up to my standards.

I'd say this is a nice new discovery I made and I would definitely go back there again for brunch.",2

I mean REALLY who the hell stays in there room in Vegas. Who cares if the TV isn't working;get over yourself.

Positives: 
+ There was one person ahead of us at check-in so check in was quick and painless. ( We arrived about 5pm on a Thursday)

+ Room was the bomb.com! We got a Jr. Suite and upgraded to a bigger suite for $20 extra a night. 

+ We were halfway down the hall from the elevator. And the hall wasn't hella cold like it is in the MGM which I liked :) The room, OH THE ROOM! It was great! Enough room for 3 girls and probably could had had another 1 or 2 friends with us and still had room.

+ Everything in room was beyond clean! No dust, no shit from other people. Everything worked fine.

+ Called housekeeping and bell man to bring things up once in room, wait was no more than 10 minutes IF even that!

+ Walk to the  Casino floor was easily 5 minutes. We passed up Fat Tuesdays so that was great!

+ Went to the pool at 6pm two days in a row and it was nice. Not too many ppl, playing cool music. Still hot as hell! lol!! But definitely better than during the day.

+ Ordered room service twice, was really quick, probably took 20 minutes from time of order to time we rec'd food.

+ Check out was easy! Checked out on the tv..so don't know how check out is. (We left Monday also so that might make a difference in check out times)

Only negatives:

- That security guard was annoying at the elevators...except for that cutie lol. I understand you want to make sure none of the riff raff gets into the elevators but always having to dig in my purse to get the key got annoying. I'd always forget until we got right up there...I was just tryna get up to the room! Geeze lol!

- Taxis weren't plentiful.

Robin's Thursday evening restorative yoga class is the main reason I drive from central Phoenix out to Mesa once a week.  She is an amazing soul and makes even the newbies feel at ease.  She talks you through letting emotions and tensions go with each breathe and reminds you that you are there to restore not only your body but your mind.  She teaches yoga at other studios and private too...I seriously would follow her anywhere.

I've been there 4 times in one week, that's how good it is! So far I've had the fish tacos, fried catfish, seared ahi, and the crabcake sandwich which is by far my favorite thing on the menu. Just a heads up, they sell out fast. Everything there is made fresh to order and the sides are just as great as the main dishes. I highly recommend the kale salad. Funny thing, the only reason I had it was because they messed up my order and gave me the salad instead. I'm not one to be a picky eater and mistakes happen, so I kept the salad. Best decision I've ever made. From then on, I always get the kale salad. If you get any of the fish plates you have different options of how it's prepared; blackened, grilled, seared, and fried. I'm not a big fan of fried food anymore, but how they fry their fish doesn't have that greasy taste to it and tastes really clean, which I love. The best part of this place is the price. So fresh fish and other seafood options, this place is so cheap and the portions are just right. I found a new favorite lunch spot.",2

Ordering was fast and easy you just write the number on a slip of paper. There was so many options to choose from! My friend and I ordered a total of 3 things two of which were cold ""desserts"" and one was hot and what they called a ""snack"". For the hot item I ordered the Hong Kong style steamed rice role it was so good! I wish it had more sauce (peanut butter and hoisin sauce) but overall I it was good. The cold desserts was the taro sago mixed and the other was the taro black glutinous rice w/ pearl delight. When they arrived I was first confused because I wasn't sure if it was our order and the server wasn't even sure she asked us ""did you order this?"" But we casually answered yes and tried to figure it out. We assumed we would be able to see more of the added ""toppings"" on top of the ""soup"". After we figured it out we digged in. I order the taro black glutinous rice w/ pearl delight it tasted great overall but I especially enjoyed the glutinous balls. They were so chewy, and they were just the right amount of sweet!

Nestled on the side of Metro Square, this place is great value for the quality it serves. Even upon entering, you'll see into the somewhat open kitchen with the cooks wrapping up the dumplings as the orders come in. 

For non-Chinese readers, don't be put off by the menu. Ask for the English menu, which they have readily available. My personal favourite dumplings would be the lamb ones and the pork. They come in orders of 15, so beware when ordering.

I have come here for years now, and the quality has been consistently great, if not improved.

Their chips and salsa are the bomb.  They are always hot, fresh right out of the oven.  The salsa has a great flavor, and has a nice spice to it.

I got the Burrito Chicago-style (I think that's the name of it); anyway, its a giant burrito with steak, chorizo, with green chile sauce and melted cheese over top of it.  Sour cream, guacamole, and lettuce (maybe pico de gallo?) comes with it, and it comes with a side of beans.  Moral of the story: it is A-MAZING.  The steak and chorizo are seasoned fantastically, the ingredients are fresh, and the beans were cooked great.

The service was a little slow, but it was pretty busy.  They are always eager to refill drinks and chips/salsa.

It was pretty clean inside, more than most Mexican restaurants.

Overall, Tres Potrillos is a great Mexican restaurant, with great food and a great atmosphere.  I doubt that this stuff is entirely authentic, but I can't say for sure.  Definitely the best Mexican restaurant I've been to in the Akron area.

5824,3,1547424000000,"Dr. Naomi Richman is the best!  I started seeing her about 5 weeks ago for a torn meniscus in my right knee.  

My traditional doctor took xrays and gave me meds which basically did nothing.  Even though I was in significant pain in his office during the xrays because my knee was killing me in the position he had it, he still only gave me meds!

The pain in my knee has often times been so unbearable that I would cry.  I couldn't sleep because every time I put my knee against the bed it hurt.  Walking with a limp and wearing supports on my knee were the norm for the past 5 months because of the pain.  Also, I've spent a small fortune in rubs, gels, and ointments for the pain!  Lastly, I wasn't able to ride my bike or take long walks which really made me mad!

Dr. Naomi's first treatment was so successful that I walked out of there for the first time in five months with no limp!  I actually slept at night too!  The no pain lasted for 5 days.  Then, pain started to return, but it never again reached the amont experienced earlier.  I just had my 3rd treatment, with 2 more scheduled, and I'd say my knee is 70 percent better!  I feel confident that by the end of the next 2 treatments the pain will be almost gone.  However, I'll continue with treatments until I'm 100 percent.  

Dr. Naomi's fees are reasonable.  She's caring and knowledgeable.  She's also pleasant and funny!  She doesn't watch the clock and she puts her all into each and every treatment.

I am so thankful a friend recommended her and then kept bugging me until I scheduled my first appointment!

At the foot of the chair/bed, looked to be an upside down shower mat that was also covered in filth.  I refused, and was given a cleaner (yet still filthy) place to sit/lay.  I told the girl that I wanted my brows neat, and she hurriedly applied the wax and started waxing as though she was racing the clock.  When she finished she handed me the mirror and told me they looked ""very nice"".  I looked in the mirror, and to my surprise saw my eyebrows were crookedly waxed, one side was waxed half off, and there were patches of shorter brows throughout each of my brows.  When I told her it looked terrible, she became irritated with me and whipped out an eyeliner pencil and attempted to draw in brows where the brow seemed to have been trimmed off.  I immediately told her no.  She left hair all over my face and the excess wax that had dried and fallen off her tools was sloppily dropped into my hair, which gave the appearance of bad dandruff.
I almost cried, but mostly I just wanted out of that place.
I will never go back there, and am sharing this review for everyone's benefit to think twice before putting your trust into these people's hands.",2

That type of service from our waitress, knowledge of beers and spirits from the bartender, and the professional manner of the cook that remade our food and brought it out personally, which tasted much better made it a great experience.

5857,1,1547942400000,This enterprise has wasted money on an app that is pointless. You pick up your order to be either looked at blankly as if your order was forgotten or with having to wait for them to quickly put your order together.

5868,3,1547078400000,"I was in Las Vegas for a couple of weeks and needed new glasses. Given that LensCrafters is a big company with a solid reputation, this seemed like a good choice. In some ways, it was. The eye exam was good (although I had to wait something like a week for an appointment) and I ordered prescription sunglasses and regular eyeglasses. 

Both were very expensive. I paid close to $900 for two pairs of glasses, even though their advertising makes it sound like you're going to get a good deal. Fine, I'm happy to pay good money for a quality product. Unfortunately, that's not what I received. First of all, it took several days to get my glasses. So much for glasses in about an hour. But again, if I'm getting what I paid for I don't really have a problem with the wait or the expense. My prescription sunglasses (Ray Ban) were fantastic. I love them and still wear them to this day. 

The problem is that within about a week of receiving my new eyeglasses, I started noticing small scratches on the lenses. This is after paying extra money for scratch resistant lenses, mind you. Within maybe two months of receiving my brand new, very expensive, scratch-resistant glasses, the lenses were so scratched that I had to have them replaced. Because I don't live in the U.S. and there is no LensCrafters in my city, I was basically out of luck and had to pay for new lenses out of pocket. This after about two months! I've been wearing glasses for about 25 years and I have NEVER had this happen. As a long time eyeglasses wearer, I know how to take care of my lenses and given that this has never happened in 25 years, I can only fault the company for selling inferior products at outrageous prices. (I've had the new lenses for about six months and there is not a single scratch in sight.)

I contacted their customer service number and after several weeks (seriously) without a response, I received an email stating that I should take the glasses back to the Lake Mead store where I purchased them. Well, given that it would take me about 30 hours of flying and cost several thousand dollars to get there, that was not an option. I was basically out of luck and out of money. 

The takeaway is that LensScratchers sells inferior products at top-of-the-line prices, has poor customer service after the sale, and isn't going to be of much help if you have a problem. In this case, there was a big problem. My brand new, expensive eyeglasses were so scratched that the lenses had to be replaced at my own expense. They did nothing about it. 

I will never purchase eyeglasses from any LensCrafters outlet again. They sell inferior, cheap products at a ridiculous mark up, and do not stand by the warranty. You fooled me once LensCrafters, but you will never, ever fool me again. I hope this review keeps someone else from wasting the money that I did by using your company.",1
5871,2,1548547200000,"Came here for our New Year's Eve dinner and sadly left disappointed. I ordered the spiced salmon; it initially seemed fine from the outside, but once I dissected and looked inside it was still raw. I alerted the waitress, and my plate returned apparently heated in a microwave, with it still mostly raw. I couldn't stomach to finish anything. The smashed potatoes it came with were also literally just a boiled smashed potato with no seasoning.

I'm giving 2 starts instead of 1 because my husband and friends' dinners were great (chicken & waffles and special NYE filet). The NYE special corn and crab bisque was also really good.",2

I had dined here before and know that isn't a stuffy type of place but the food and the wine list stood out when I thought about what type of place these clients would like- casual dinner, casual service but impressive food.  I make a selection from the wine list which took me a good 20 minutes.  Very impressive wine list!  I got a Pinot Noir - Green Truck, Napa.  One of my favorite wines.  Our waiter read us the specials, did he say dover sole?  Okay, I had to ponder that option.  We started with the calamari for appetizer and the buffalo mozzarella.  Both were very good, seasoned well.  I did end up getting the dover sole filleted table side and I have to say, it was perfectly prepared and perfectly deboned.   I requested veggies only on the side instead of a starch so it was served with a bunch of grilled Italian style veggies.  My favorite!  Perfect, light choice of a dinner.  My one client got the Osso Bucco and his wife got some Shrimp Pasta dish.  They were in love with their dishes and I with mine.   We then got dessert but honestly, I cannot remember what we ordered.  Too much wine and pre-dinner cocktail kicking in- or the fact that I was still eating the dover sole in my mind?  I little of both.

I like that you can mix and match if you are feeling for a little bit of this and a little bit of that. I would say my favourite is the baja fish and chicken hermanos. The baja fish was so good that one if definitely not enough and I loved the flavour combo in the chicken hermanos. They also have churros!

There are a variety of deals throughout the week including my favorite: $5 dollar ""Big ass beers"" (23 oz. beers) and $5 wing buckets on Thursdays. They also have very good grouper sandwiches.The brewery changes their beer selection throughout the year for the season changes and to keep variety in the menu. Their christmas ale is very good, along with their blueberry beer and their ""Punchin' the nuts"" beer. In the summer, the patio is in a very nice location with televisions and an outdoor bar. The inside is a little cramped around the bar area and can get pretty loud at night, but I've always enjoyed the place.

Admittedly it was a hot day in Vegas & the shop was busy however if you're busy at almost $10 a large bowl, you can afford more staffing. After 20 mins I complained & the response was ""Everyone has waited 20 mins.""

Also asked a simple question about one item in an Acai bowl I wasn't sure what it was and wasn't responded to very nicely. Won't be back",2
5921,1,1548720000000,"I have read the reviews on here, and decided to chime in.  First off, I like Harvey's.  Do I go to Harvey's all the time?  Nope.  But I enjoy the burgers and the simplicity of the place.  I have probably been there 15 times over the past 3 years, so this is a culmination of all of those meals.

Everyone talks about the decor (or lack thereof).  The inside of the place is DARK (especially when compared to most places in Phoenix).  When you leave the place during the day, make sure you have sunglasses.  After your eyes spend so much time adjusting to the lack of lighting, the sun feels like inmates coming out of solitary confinement for a month.  While the decor gets 0 stars from the Zagat type crowd, I find some sort of enjoyment with how beat down it is.  In fact, if they spruced it up, I probably wouldn't like it as much.  It is a true dive bar.

The service isn't great, but it isn't what I would call bad.  It isn't like they screw everything up, but it is a bit slow.  If you are in a hurry to eat (like most Americans on lunch hour), then maybe you should go to McDonald's across the street.

Finally, the burgers.  They are great.  Quality meat, good cheese, and plenty of char.  I never found the food unsanitary, but I have also been to Brazil, so the food here is always more sanitary.  I am not a fan of the fries (got to Delux, Gordon Biersch, or Cafe Bink if you want truly great fries), but the onion rings are good (not as good as Ted's Hot Dogs, though).  I love the fact that they have RC Cola.  I have only had drinks there 1 time.  They make them stiff, and will impair your judgement quickly if you aren't careful.  They have a heavier hand in pouring than most college bars.

Overall, I recommend it if you like dingy bars and a good burger.  Sure, there are better burgers in town, but this is pretty unique.  A little more seasoning could be used, but it isn't bad the way it is.",3

Medium sized dining room, open, with a few booths placed in the middle (odd) and tables around the outside.  Very warm, and relaxing with an exposed kitchen and three or four busy chefs.

Simple, uncomplicated menu.  Food is absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. 

A long time ago I banned myself from ordering pork chops in restaurants.  No matter how good the restaurant was, they always overcooked it.  Sticking to that tradition, I ordered the Baked Margherita Linguine  and it was outstanding and reasonably priced.  However, one in our party ordered the Wood Fired Pork Chop and it was out-of-this-world delicious!

Not only was that pork chop cooked to absolute perfection, it came with a drizzle of the most outstanding pork sauce I've ever tasted.  If I could learn to make that sauce, it would go on everything... including pancakes!

I normally enjoy a large pizza with pesto sauce and add mushrooms and ham or bacon. The smokey flavor of the crust and the ham, married with the richness of the pesto make this pizza my favorite every time I visit.

5959,3,1548633600000,"I've been here twice now, and I have to say that I've been pretty content both times: in Yelp terminology, ""A-OK"". Although, I must admit that one of the selling points of this place is its prime location. 

The first time I was here was for a birthday gathering with a handful of close friends. I ordered the ""Wise Resolution"" cocktail and the butternut squash ravioli. Service was friendly but pretty slow, and the food wasn't that memorable. I should mention, however, that I brought in cupcakes and they were really great about bringing out plates and cutlery so we could eat them. 

More recently, I was here was for a work dinner with my team. We requested a private table and ended up sitting in this long booth behind the host area. It's an interesting concept, but we had to keep passing things down the table which was a bit annoying. To start, we ordered some bruschetta, spring rolls, and shrimp for the table. I had the margharita pizza as my main. Once again, the food was fine, but nothing blew me away. Drinks were good - I had a regular Manhattan in lieu of the O&B version (the combination of vanilla and liquor makes me want to gag), as well as a glass of wine (J. Lohr) and some custom-made pineapple cocktail. Our server was friendly and a strong upseller, always making suggestions, but not extremely attentive, which I think could be partly attributed to how busy this place is...all the time. Reservations are strongly recommended.

The space is modern and clean, but it can get really loud, which makes intimate conversations difficult. I would say it's a decent choice for groups, because the menu has such a wide variety of options (ranging from curry to pizza to steak) that there's likely to be something for everybody.",2

Great variety of food to choose from and very flavourful as well. I found the cheesy baked mussels were amazing and the deep-fried milk custards were crispy and delicious. The shark fin soup was also okay, the best part was probably the sesame oil which gave it a very rich texture and amazing aroma~

Their specialty drinks are not too bad, however I found the taro powdered bubble tea too watery and the bubbles were overly soft and squishy. Yet, throughout our meal, the dining room was about half full. In addition, its sister restaurant which shares the same managment, work staff, and kitchen had a couple of customers. However, there were only a few patrons and many were there for the special hot pot deal.

I found the washrooms to be rather unkempt and there was only one stall for each gender, this seems to rather hazardous for peak hours...

6038,2,1548288000000,"WOW! What a FANTASTIC breakfast!

Make sure to get here early, or at least be willing to wait up to half an hour for a spot during the busy hours. This little bakery/coffee shop/cafe is super cozy and loaded with superb breakfast offerings. There are lots of windows that the staff will open up on mild days, and the space is warm and inviting.

You can certainly grab a pastry and cappuccino to go (their pastries are sooo good), but if you stay it's best to get a mix of dishes so that you can try a little bit of everything. My husband and I shared the ricotta toast and the yogurt & granola bowl. I can't believe I am rating a restaurant 5 stars of two dishes that might be some of the simplest food you can eat. HOWEVER, Olive & Gourmando serves up some of the lightest, freshest dishes you could ever ask for. Their ricotta toast comes with whipped ricotta, sprinkled with honey and orange zest, served along with thick, oh-so-delicious toast. The yogurt and granola bowl was the best I've ever had. Fresh yogurt and even fresher fruit. Being from America, I am used to all the (what I call) ""sad"" fruit; melon, grapes cantaloupe. Here we had blackberries, blueberries, black grapes, strawberries and julienne apples. What a great combo.

I could've eaten at this place every day of vacation, and kind of wish I had. Definitely check it out.",1
6039,1,1548547200000,"Fuji killed it.  My wife and I were eager to try this place as we both love Hibachi and Sushi, and the buzz had been growing for this new spot.  Took a trip over there on a Tuesday night around 6:30pm and were seated right away.

Love the style of the place - bright, colorful, modern, lots of decorations, and a fun Hibachi area that keeps the tables close and social.  This is the first thing that really stuck out to me, as I've been to quite a few different Hibachi restaurants and many of them feel pretty sterile, or like in Ginza's case, run down.  It's a shame because I rarely get a bad meal at any of those spots, but good atmosphere is not a given.

The service matched the décor.  Our waitress was very friendly and good about bringing out drinks on time, answering questions, and having a general good sense of things.  It was also nice that they seat you and start the meal process as you get there, unlike many places where you need a full table first.  We still waited for the table to fill up to get the main courses going, but at least here you get your soup and salad ahead of time.  Speaking of those, the salad was nice, a good flavor and I'm not normally a salad guy.  The soup was luke warm and a little too sour for me, but I'm sure it was just timing.

But then Chef Han (or Han Solo as he put it lol) rolled in.  This guy was awesome.  Put on one of the best shows I've seen, doing all the usual tricks and plus a whole ton more.  He walks in with fire coming out of his hat, and I knew at that point this meal was about to get real.  Dude proceeds to go ape on the knives, fire everywhere, and talks to everyone at the table throughout the meal.  He had my wife come up and bounce the eggs, made all of us laugh a lot, and literally lit his hands on fire.   That's 'effin service.  Don't want to spoil all of his show so I'll stop there, but he was a cool chef and really entertaining.  He talked a bit about his past when I asked, and he's been through a long windy experience leading up to this point.  Absolutely request him if he's around.

The food was good.  Not the best Hibachi I've had but very tasty and I absolutely will return because of the experience and also some custom tailoring that our chef mentioned a lot of them do (7  Japanese spice filet mmmmhmm).  The main thing with the food was that I felt the fried rice was a little bland and soggy (but again still good), otherwise everything else is hot to trot including the delicious shrimp and accompanying oil/sauce.  The vegetables were on point, super great to see Broccoli in the mix as I'm a big fan and it was wonderful with the mustard sauce.

Pretty sure I will be back soon and won't be visiting the other Hibachi joints anytime in the near future.  Next time I want to bring a cadre of friends though, and get their birthday drums going.

6060,2,1547769600000,"My husband wanted to go to the annual Hawaiian Festival in the back of the Rio Resort & Casino.  I was not feeling so hot and did not want to fight the crowds.  We met in the middle and decided to try Island Style.  

As we drove up, went in and sat down, there is nothing special about the ambiance of this place.  The place did not feel welcoming.  Bland, basic decor, lighting is almost hospital sterile in many ways.  Based on the name, we thought it would be 75% Hawaiian food and 25% Asian Fusion food.  But in reality it was 30% Hawaiian food and 70% Korean food.

We focused on the Hawaiian dishes and we just thought they were OK.  We tried Bi Bim Bopp, Masubi and the Combo Dish (meat & egg platter or sorts).  Based on reviews on YELP on this place, we were expecting something more and some element of WOW.  It did not happen.  It's not that it was bad, but We've experienced better.  Food was just OK.  Staff was nice, but not particularly attentive of friendly.

6090,1,1547942400000,"I find Cibo is a hit and miss especially with the service.  While the restaurant has a nice atmosphere and the location is great I find the menu especially the current Fall/Winter 2014 to be quite weak and poorly balanced. I am definitely disappointed. Currently there are many rich and overly heavy foods and I do not feel there is balance in the menu. They no longer have creative and tasty salads for an entree nor as an option for an appetizer. There is no longer light appetizers either. We had ordered the Roasted Cauliflower as a starter and it was poorly put together and so heavy with all the cream and butter it left my stomach upset. If you like comfort food which is overly heavy and excessively oil based then this may be the place for you. If you prefer variety, taste, balance and flavour then I would recommend going elsewhere. I hope come Spring 2015 the menu is more impressive but for now I have no intention of returning.",2
6093,3,1547510400000,"I love Four Peaks. I like to try to support Local Restaurants whenever possible, and Four Peaks Brewery makes it easy!
Admittedly, I'm not much of a beer drinker, but when we have out of town guests we always stock Kilt Lifter, and they are always very appreciative- so I guess it is good!
Anyway, the atmosphere is very much pub and loud with games, and people drinking. 

The food is NOT your typical bar food. Everything seems to be made in house. 

I love the Garden Burger. I add Sauteed Onions and Mushrooms, a little bit of mayo and it is completely a sloppy, yummy mess. I'm obsessed. The bun is buttered and grilled. 
I often try not to get a side of french fries and opt for salad. The salad is always fresh and their ranch dressing is homemade and fabulous. When I do opt for the French Fries I always enjoy them. They are so perfectly fried and seasoned. They are beer battered along with much of the fried goods at Four Peaks. REALLY great fries. I also use the ranch for those ;)

Other Hits Include appetizers like:
Bavarian Pretzels- Mmm spicy mustard sauce!
Spanakopita
Garlic Beer Bread
Thai Hummus- with peanut sauce

AND if I didn't have a difficulty with lactose, I would finish the Spinach and Artichoke dip on my own in about 3 seconds flat.

They also have a great Vegetable Beer Bread.

They have a surprising amount of Vegetarian Options, and I know that carnivores go crazy for their food as well.

6097,1,1547078400000,"Yay for modern décor! :-) 

Loved the concept and the layout of the room. We had a room with a living room, couch, and mini kitchen set up.  
At first glance, everything appeared beautiful. Looking at things closely, eveything wasn't as clean and not everything in the room was in working condition. 
-Bad smell in the shower
-hand held shower head didn't work 
-light not working 
-sand residue in jaccuzi tub 
Which is a disappointment when staying at a fancy hotel during your first Vegas trip. 

Overall, I loved the idea of the room. Staff was semi-friendly. Next time I'll stay closer near the strip. :) 

Tips: I was told the windows don't open to the balcony due to safety reasons. About 5 minute drive to the strip and Uber will run you around $8 one way. Bus 202 is in front of the hotel 5$ for a 24 hour pass. 
Things look closer then they appear!! Walked to the Rio casino north from the hotel and it took about 25 minutes. Yay for cardio!

I have eaten here a handful of times. I find the food to be okay. The chilli chicken is a whole lot of heat. I ordered the Hakka chicken chow mein and it was too greasy for my liking. 

On Friday, my manager had a huge craving for Manchurian fish (dry). He loves this place. I simply wanted a break from work, so I tagged along. 

I ordered the Manchurian chicken with hot and sour soup. My boss said that ""[I was] going to die"" because both items are spicy. I can actually take the heat. I don't do it too often. 

I am still alive. The hot and sour soup was good. There was a bit of heat. I wished that the mushrooms weren't canned ones. 

My Manchurian chicken with gravy dish came next. The spring roll was crispy and delicious. I rarely like them. My fish was spicy and flavourful. I was impressed. 

My manager was waiting to see my face turn red due to the spiciness of what I had ordered. It never happened. I also completely polished my plate. It was good. 

Perhaps I should stick with ordering this dish when I am here. It's pretty cheap ($8.99 plus tax) to have a good lunch.

6148,1,1546819200000,"When I lived at this property it was great, Clean, quiet, and nice amenities. The problem is this company and their ethical values. I learned from management that by law they do not have to give you 60 days notice for your lease renewal (mine was not even drawn up 60 days before, even if I were to have asked for the new rent price). I planned on staying at Symphony because I liked living there, so I did not give a 60 day notice to vacate. When I got my lease renewal, maybe 40 days before my lease was up, I was notified my rent would go up a little over $250 (I was living in a non-renovated apt $820). I am a teacher and could not afford the $1100 rent for a 1 bedroom. That day I went in and turned in a notice to vacate. I then later received a charge upon moving out of $514 for not giving 60 days notice to vacate. This company did not give me 60 days, therefore I had no idea I wanted to leave until I got the notice. Management was incredibly rude about the situation as well and kept repeating policy to me instead of trying to meet me halfway (I asked for a partial discount on the $514) and rectify the situation.
I was really disgusted with how they conduct business here. I am a teacher, professor, and doctoral student, not someone who is irresponsible with payments or causes problems.


Just be warned if you do live here make sure you don't expect them to give you 60 days notice on increase in rent upon lease renewal, even it if it is a ridiculous amount, quick way to make $500 off someone.

The cashier was friendly, but the dude putting the orders together mixed them up, giving me a 3 piece. I know some of you are thinking why I didn't just take the free piece, but I was raised better than that so I didn't. When we tried to tell him the mistake, he got all pissy and copped an attitude with us! Hello! We're trying to fix YOUR mistake!! Even his co-workers were trying to tell him I only ordered a 2 piece. The food was good, but his attitude completely ruined it. We'll go to the Church's Chicken across the street next time.",2

Une belle carte, il y en a pour tous les goûts ! Végé ou non.
Nous avons pris: le poulet cajun (dans la section des sandwiches froids) à la mangue, avocat, tomates; la salade #24 aux nouilles, tofu, verdure.. et le grille cheese au fromage de raclette (oui je sais c'est encore l'été !!) et son ketchup maison, accompagné d'une salade verte à la vinaigrette.
Le tout très copieux et dé-li-cieux !

For my cocktail I went with the Pink Panther which was made with gin and peppercorn and a very loving and kin and amazing bartender because it was one of the strongest drinks I've had at a stripside restaurant but also tastyyyyyyy. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Got to try the Beauty Elixir which was also very good but sweeter.

For our plates that came out we received yellowtail sashimi (always a good choice), avocado toast (not my favorite to ever get at restaurants but this was surprisingly good and would order again), kale and apple salad (so good and one my personal favorites from the night) lobster tacos, and the god damned spaghettini (pesto and eggs and delicious carbs, this is the numba one favorite).

6235,1,1547510400000,"This place is a logistical mess. 

The concept of having a ""4 in 1"" restaurant is cool. It brings to mind ""Marché Mövenpick"", but Washoku fails in nearly every aspect. 

Firstly when you come in there are only 2 sets of menus that are taped to the front desk so only 2-4 people can actually see what the options are at a time. There is no signage or anyone explaining how a ""4 in 1"" restaurant works. Is it market style like Marche? is it buffet style? is it separate restaurants? 

It happens to be just 4 distinct ""restaurants"" (really rooms that don't get along) that aren't related at all in operation besides sharing a common hallway. Once you choose a restaurant you cannot enjoy any other ""restaurant"" without paying for a whole new meal. The concept of the 4 in 1 is therefore meaningless. 

The food quality is below average. Most items were worse than something you'd find at a Mandarin buffet. Low quality meats, sushi rolls made with too much rice, and grainy ice cream.

When we were there this past week, we ate at quite a few big name restaurants on our visit but was craving a great steakhouse.  I asked a friend to suggest a great steak while we were still in town so here is my two cents.

The ambiance was loud and alive, reminiscent of a traditional Chicago steakhouse, minus the sound of the casino.  When I ordered wine for our table of 6, our server (Caroline), was very suggestive about wine pairing with each course as we progressed through our meal, which I really enjoy and find a great part of the culinary expirience.  Our server was also great at answering all questions that my guests had regarding portions, ingredients and even answered questions regarding my wife's allergies.  She was pleasant and well informed.  Top notch!  

For starters, the group started out with the crab cakes and calamari, which were very good, as were the wedge salad and roasted baby beet salad.  A couple of us had the clam chowder and said it was rustic and hearty in style.

Many of us ordered the bone-in dry aged NY steak that she suggested and everyone at the table commented how cooked perfectly there steaks were cooked considering almost everyone ordered them cooked differently, we are a nightmare in restaurants!
Other's had the Colorado lamb and commented how nice it was that it was not New Zealand lamb which tends to be a bit gamey and alot smaller chops.  My wife had the Irish organic salmon and loved it, as her allergies were looked after.  Thank you.
We tried many of the side dishes and they were all very good as well.

All in all it was a very fun evening, the food and service were great!

By the time the table was ready the appetizers were not so they brought it to our table. Food was as expected for the keg. I have noticed that the entrees are quite salty. We ordered prime rib dinner and steak and lobster. It was a twin lobster tail. One was great but the other all mushy and deteriorated. Could've been better. Prime rib dinner was expected but the onion strings  were very salty. They have a kids menu but portions very small and for pricI think you're better off ordering off the main menu.

The couscous is my favorite side dish. It has a bit of a curry taste to it, which I quite enjoy. They typically also have a special or two every day, which they post on a board daily.

We were uncertain about what we wanted but after talking with Aaron he was able to help us narrow it down. He gave great advice about the size of the tattoo we wanted because of it's location. He drew out the design and it was even better than what we were thinking when we walked in. 
I was super impressed with the steps he took to make sure everything was clean and sanitized after each patron. I like the fact that they drape everything, it definitely shows how dedicated they are to cleanliness. This was my daughters first tattoo and Aaron was great about explaining things to her and reassuring her throughout her tattoo.

6334,2,1546732800000,"I always like to stop in here when I am on that side of town for meetings, etc. There are SO many types of Skechers in terms of styles. Not only is it a factory outlet store, but they also maintain a huge clearance section (about a third of the store) with great selections for children and adults. They always have great sales across the store and it is rare that I can't find the shoe I want in the size I need.

One not-so-pleasant thing on my most recent visit...some of the sales associates might benefit from an employee meeting to discuss conversations that are appropriate vs. not so appropriate on the sales floor around customers (realistically...not appropriate around anyone). As I was shopping, several associates in conversation with one another passed by me. One of the comments made to the others was referencing someone they all knew as being ""geriatric"" and referenced the person's just being generally slow in terms getting/understanding things, etc. By the conversation, the pairing of the word with the behavior was not actually referencing a senior-age person to me. So it sent a message on multiple levels.  Perhaps a few minutes of conversational training during the next employee's meeting might be helpful. 

As the person who heard it, it wasn't such that I would stop shopping there. I think it is a situation where everyone might be better served by making it a teachable moment. Sometimes the best win-win situation is not ignoring an issue or getting rid of an issue....it is just taking a few minutes in an employee meeting to stress the importance of positive communication and behavior on the sales floor, what is expected, and discussing why such comments are not helpful nor edifying for anyone on or off the sales floor.  

Overall, the employees are great. They want your shopping experience to be positive and they want to help. I always enjoy my shopping experience and with the selection and deals they have, I may wander around the store multiple times, but it almost always leads to finding that perfect pair of shoes!!",2

Great customer service and given how the restaurant ensured they made the situation right makes me want to go back for sure.

There are so many different sandwiches to choose from! I had the hot sausage with cheese and an egg....yum. It was in no way greasy like other big sandwiches. The coleslaw was so flavorful and falling out of the bread there was so much. Definitely filled me up.

6396,3,1546819200000,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN ALL OF MONTREAL AND I RANK IT WITHIN MY TOP FIVE FAVORITE RESTAURANTS IN THE WORLD.

My husband and I are incredibly fond of chef Guillaume Saint-Georges' À L'Os. We recommend this restaurant to everyone and anyone looking for a particularly special and memorable meal in Montreal. The restaurant has a wonderfully inviting atmosphere. It is clear to me that someone took great care in thinking out the details of the dining room so that patrons will feel comfortable and welcomed. Even the restrooms are very clean and aesthetically pleasing. I very much like the layout of the restaurant. I particularly like the open kitchen where one can spy on the staff doing their magic. 

Among the entrées, we are devout fans of the restaurant's blood sausage. If I have the opportunity to choose my last meal on earth, please let it include the ''os à moelle fumé'' at À L'Os. I have ordered it a few times now and it is always cooked perfectly and it never disappoints. While I like to stick to my favorites, my husband prefers to try everything new on the menu and I am so glad that he does so that I can try his selection without forsaking my favorites. 

We have never had anything here that was less than amazing! In fact, I don't understand why this restaurant does not have more reviews. It is truly a magnificent culinary experience!

N.B. - don't forget to bring your favorite bottle (or two) of wine.",2
6397,2,1548633600000,"We agree with reviewers who are extremely disappointed by this once noble restaurant since its change of ownership. 
      Service  was impolite and ill-informed.
      We were first placed for a party of six at a boardroom type table that could seat ten. The manager said he had no other table for six and claimed that the person who made our reservation had asked for that particular table. She corrected him. He gave another explanation, but found a round table for us a few minutes later.
       The drinks waiter had never heard of a common aperitif. The traditional steak and seafood menu seemed overpriced by most steakhouse or fine dining standards. 
      The waiter hectored us as we ordered, rudely corrected a request for rack of lamb to be done pink, said we meant medium, and lectured us on all of his preferred definitions. When main courses finally arrived much later my rack of lamb ran the gamut from well-done to bloody. My wife's halibut was dry.
      After dinner, two of our party asked to share a small 20-year-old port for twenty dollars a glass. Unlike the identical Taylor Fladgate I had recently enjoyed elsewhere at that price, it came in a tulip-shaped liqueur glass that may have spoiled its bouquet; the port didn't seem right. The liqueur glass held two ounces instead of the three elsewhere.
      A waiter had knocked over an empty glass on his tray (for sharing). It wasn't replaced. After being loudly admonished for complaining, we spoke to the manager, who said he had seen the incident and had sent another glassful on the house. None had arrived. Eventually he himself brought another, but too late.
      We had to ask for our bill after sitting for half an hour at an empty table.  When it came a waiter said that as well as coffee, all of our  ""aperitifs"" were on the house. Not so. They were on the bill. The port was not.",3
6401,2,1548115200000,"Just like the Yelp rating says - this place is A-Ok!

I had purchased a Groupon for $25 for $55 worth of food for four people - pretty good deal! We came on a Saturday evening and it was not very busy - I think a total of two other families were in the restaurant.

Our server was nice and friendly, though a bit absent, and he said he was going to bring us some board games (they have a list of some common ones available) but, alas, they never arrived at our table :(.

Brunchworks has a HUGE menu, so there's definitely something for everyone! They seem to specialize in breakfast and comfort food: many different kinds of poutine, pizzas, burgers, hot dogs, hot sandwiches, generic breakfast foods, etc.

I was able to sample quite a few items: quesadillas, breakfast platter (eggs, bacon, french toast, pancakes, etc.), breakfast poutine, cesar salad, and chili dog - all tasty! Did anything blow me away? No, not really. But you can't really go wrong with good food and large portion sizes at good prices.

It's the type of place that works well with a number of situations. It's super family friendly so a good option when you're with your fam jam looking for a brunch spot, but it's also the type of place where you could come solo & enjoy a coffee and some sweets! 

Worth checking out if you're in the area & looking for some no frills brunch, or craving some comfort food!",2

6428,3,1548547200000,"I enjoy the facilities and services at 121. Parking and saunas are a huge plus. The only concerns I have are regarding their recently opened Uptown Cycle. I've attended at least five classes here, and I think the studio space is well decorated (albeit a tad small) and the instructors are decent for the most part. The ""reception staff"" however needs some work. The past two classes I've taken I've been greeted with a surly, insinuating ""can I help you?"" upon walking in. Perhaps a more welcoming and friendly ""Hi! Are you here for the 12pm class? Let me check you in"" would be more suitable. Additionally, instead of sitting in your chairs during class on your phones (yes, class participants do see you back there) try to be more a tune to the class needs. For example, 30 minutes into an hour long class today, the room was getting quite stuffy. Obviously the instructor is preoccupied, so maybe the staff member doing nothing should take some initiative and turn a fan on for the class. 

I personally love 121, their new spin studio could just use some more improvements.",2

6470,1,1547164800000,"This is a really fun place. The sitting is a little crowded so you are basically sharing a table with the people next to you. I am not sure if they did it to maximize space or part of a Japanese tradition. The outcome is that you can not help it and you will hear your neighbors conversation and they will hear yours so might not be the perfect place for a romantic dinner or a date. If you do come as a group you can actually get a big table in a less crowded area. 
The cocktails (as you can see in my picture) are great about 9$ but they taste real good and they do make them with a punch. I also had the vegetarian dumplings which were so tasty and not that expensive (about 5$). This is a cool place and I would defiantly want to re-visit it.",3

But the establishment was very clean. I had a michelada which was very good! One of the best I've had. And for appetizer I had their seafood guacamole which was AMAZING! For my plate I had their lomita ceviche which was spicy! But I love spicy so it was perfect for me! I will take one star off due to the server not being 5 star.

6478,2,1547856000000,"My wife and I were here a few years ago on one of our many trips to Pittsburgh and had to come back.

The first time I was there I had a Chicago Dog which was delicious. I can't remember what my wife had but it was so good she insisted we make it back on out most recent trip.

We stopped by around dinner time on Saturday and the place was hopping. We sat on the bar side which was even louder than the restaurant but fine for us to have dinner. The staff was all very nice and gave our option of eating outside, at a table by the bar or waiting for one in the actual restaurant.

Since my last trip I became a vegetarian and stick to a pretty strict low sodium diet so I didn't try the vegan hot dog (though I may next time I visit). I was happy to see the other vegetarian options which were on the healthier side. I ended up getting the grilled veggie salad which was so large I had it for dinner another night.

My wife (who is NOT a vegetarian) had Bacon Cheddar dag and a handful or fries pub style and said both were delicious.

We both had the draft root beer which is absolutely delicious.

Maybe it's because I'm not from the area but I don't think the prices are THAT high, for what you are getting the seem reasonable to me but I can see how to compared to some other places it may feel like you are paying a lot for what you are getting. To me it's worth every dime.

I actually love hot dogs which was the reason we came here in the first place but we love the food so much there that I am more than happy to get a salad or another one of the healthier options.",2

6495,1,1546732800000,"I have been coming to the Bullring for years. Since the time that the backstretch was actually the front and the stands faced the setting sun. Those were the days before real restrooms and snack stands were built. And if you look closely at the back stretch you can see where the old victory lane was. History is awesome.

Now that your history lesson is over, lets talk about the present. The Bullring is still a top notch racing facility. Being a 3/8 mile oval means that there is not a bad seat in the house. There is one seat in particular that I prefer and it is up where the benches have backs. That starts around row 15. Below that and you have no back support. Still, you can see the entire track from wherever you choose to sit. There is plenty to see here. So many different classes of racecars. From a young age, kids start in the Bandelero class. Then they might move up to the Legends and Thunder Cars. From there you have the Bombers (my favorite), the Super Stocks, Modifieds (loud and fast), and Late Models. There is no shortage of racing action. 

On any given Saturday you will see qualifying, heat races, trophy dashes and feature races. There are touring series like USAC Midget cars and last night had the North American Big Rigs. It was almost hard to see these trucks hauling a$$ through all their exhaust. Then on special nights you might get a demolition derby, waterless boat races (cars towing boats with no trailer), monster trucks, drift cars, and a jet powered dragster that melts another car. The fireworks on the track may even transfer to the sky for a fireworks show to end the evening. I am speaking of course of the annual Night of Fire held every year on July 3rd. This is the summer send off at the Bullring and one that is worth the trip. It is excitement galore.

The magic here is that the Bullring has stayed open through tough economic times. When other tracks across the country have either closed or delayed opening, the Bullring has remained steady. Inflation has dictated higher ticket prices and the end of $1 hot dogs (now $2) and $1 beers (now $2 or $3). It is still an affordable way to entertain yourself for a few hours at a time. It is still cheaper than a two hour movie with a large popcorn and Coke and a night at the Bullring lasts three times as long.",2

1.  You charged me for something i had asked not to put in.  She then went ahead and said there is no nacho cheese.  You fucking sell nachos there and you tell me you dont have nacho cheese?  Ill be calling the owner about this.

2.  And if you fucking put in something i had asked t take out in the first place why the fuck would you charge me 92 cents to put it back in

Also i asked her whats in the carne asada fries.  She didnt tell me there were veans in it.  If you dont fuckin know whats in it.  Turn the fuck around and ask the fuckin cook.

The breakfast panini is good too when it's too early for lunch. Their iced tea is organic and I always stick with the green tea. They have illy coffee and illy raw sugar. The only downside is it's kinda small so when it's crowded it can be hard to find a table and it's definitely becoming too cold to sit outside. Sometimes it can take a bit to get your food during the lunch hour because the surrounding office people come in and it gets crowded fast but it's nothing that doesn't keep me from coming back.

The guys running it now are probably the coolest ever. They always have a couple interesting items, if not total gems. Most of the stuff is super deep discount cheapola. 

I also have this store to thank for even discovering Yelp at all. I was looking for the hours of operation when i stumbled upon the review from 3/24/08. I instantly got hooked on the site.

 As for the next time I'm coming to Coventry...probably a year from today. Driving on the east side( cleve hts and shaker hts in particular) is a severe pain in the rumpus room compared to driving out here around Parma, Fairview, Lakewood, etc. I used to do it for a living for seven years, and i don't miss it one bit.

The meat station was featuring barbecue ribs.   However, there were none available.   
The bathrooms were over crowded.  Way too small for the size of the restaurant.   And they were very dirty.    The odor in the restroom was enough to eliminate the appetite I had from the lack of food.  I

I heard hubby give address and directions correctly first time. They finally called us back and told my husband they couldn't find us. He gave same directions again. I called back to say we wanted fresh made, not hour and a half old pizza. He said making new pizza and husband gave wrong address. I said I heard husband give correct address, he said he has to hire/fire bad drivers all the time and said making new pizza.

Not a big pasta fan but when I had one of their pasta dishes, I was impressed with how much I enjoyed their al dente pasta!   Pick anyone! Their soups are also good and salads are light and fresh.

The staff have always been very courteous and pleasant, which is a big thing.  I tend to get analysis paralysis when I have to decide on the spot where to eat...especially in a food court setting! Happily, I can safely say that Le Cartet is my no-brainer go-to resto and I'm guaranteed a nice food experience :d


The reason I can't give them 5 stars is that a few times I've eaten there, there was always at least 1 pesky small black fly, moth or something buzzing around!!

So far the best for i hv been tried. But the noodle quality was a bit hard and not chewy enough as Kyouka I tried last time.

Maybe if you specify one of their 100 tequila options it might have been much better. I ordered a beef burrito. It was literally hot seasoned ground beef in a tortilla. Nothing inside at all. I would have expected cheese, lettuce, vegetables, etc. I suppose the cheap price prohibits making it a really good option. I am guessing that there are better items on the menu. If you told me I have to go back and have the same items I would definitely pass. The saving grace was that the server was friendly and prompt. Kaetlyn did a good job on ensuring we had everything we needed. It is a pretty small dining area and loud so probably go early or later if you want a relaxing Mexican food kind of dinner night.

My wife loves their grilled salmon (she's ordered it twice), but the portion size isn't enough for her, which is funny because she is always the one that brings half of her dinner home.

Final note - the salted caramel pudding is fantastic.",3

First the host placed me and my wife at a booth that would fit 8 people. The window was facing the afternoon sun and she never asked to lower the blinds. After a few minutes of sitting in the direct sun and starting to sweat, I asked we could be moved. She asked if we wanted to sit at the bar. "" No, please just seat us at another table or booth"".  She did as I asked. Even though the table she took us to was clean on top, you could have filled a waste basket with the food and chips that where under it. She grabbed a broom and did sweep it out. So I started to look around. The place was a complete mess. Tables with plates and food still on them and the floor was a complete disaster. Ok, lets just eat I told my wife. The waitress ask for our drink order. Great time for a margarita. Not really. Time for a lot of sweet and sour. The food was just middle of the road. I hope your experience is better than mine.",2

The dealing school I attended has been out of business for many years.  I wanted to brush up on my skills and learn a new game or two.  I checked out several dealing schools.  None of them offered to help me out until I met Alex at CEG.  I signed up for baccarat and pai gow poker, but Alex has helped me immensely with my blackjack and roulette (things have really changed since the 80's). He is on top of the job market and alerts all students when opportunities arise.  He is professional and extremely passionate about the business.  His mom (who has taught baccarat for many years in Las Vegas) teaches baccarat at the school and is extremely knowledgeable, patient and elegant in her craft.  The school opens early and closes late making it easy to learn while working another job.  I highly recommend CEG to anyone who is interested in a career in gaming.",2

Then when they hand me my order we get into a huge argument because I asked where my drink was, then I was told that I only paid for 2 slices of pizza!! No drink!! At $7??!!

6699,3,1547337600000,"I originally had a negative review based on the collective experience we'd had for many orders; the one prior to this, I removed after doing all the legwork to get a hold of the actual owner, despite his ""manager's"" outrageous behavior (I won't detail it again - suffice it to say it involved personal insults and a host of other crap, along with refusing to give me any way to get in touch with the owner).  Only after seeing my review did the owner contact me.  He assured me we'd have no more hiccups, and in good faith, we believed him.

Ordered a couple nights ago, through grubhub.  Would think it wasn't a toughie, a medium one-topping pizza, and an extra-large two topping pizza.  Well - yep, it was, as usual, an apparent toughie.  After over an hour, two....medium pizzas arrived, though we'd paid for one medium and one extra large.  This happens all the time with these people, and I regret we gave them another shot.  The original reasoning given was that the two medium pizza order was what they got from Grubhub, and so they can't help the error.  As it turns out, em, yep, it was at the store end - on consulting THEIR OWN TICKET it said the right order.

Screwed up order.  Again.  And again.  And....well, yeah.  I want to be clear, the driver wasn't at fault and he was a great guy.  It was at the store level.  Simply, they don't have their ^%$# together.  At all.

Additionally, and this is a warning on Grubhub - but though grubhub says they accept Paypal, they do NOT accept PP credit, and this policy isn't mentioned anywhere on the site.  Though this is our default payment method, today we were surprised to find out it's coming from our checking account.  This wasn't planned for, and it is going to screw us up with fees.

They pretty much told us to deal with it because that was the class of car we rented. They had other cars in our class available that would have fit our child safety seat but told us they didn't. While we were at the counter they were letting their friends pick out a car (Same class) they wanted and then they told us we didn't have an option. We ended up going  to the airport to switch it out because it wasn't safe. They have zero concerns about safety as long as they get paid. 

To add to it they gave us a car below our class and insisted that it was our class. We checked the website and verified with the company that the car they gave us was not the class that we had rented. Not only did they flat out lie to us but they interfered with the safety of our child. This place will rip you off. They don't care what size of car you pay for because they will give you what they want to give you regardless. I would say that this location is not to be trusted and will indeed scam you.

Dennis behind the bar was personable, drinks were good, but took WAY too long per drink. We suspected he was new...? There was literally only one other customer at the bar, no reason for the long wait. And why no one else at the bar on a Saturday night? Our appetizer, Burrata & Tomato Salad, literally came with one half of a cherry tomato...only one half of one, tiny, little, cherry tomato. We thought they must have forgotten the tomatoes, so we asked. Rob brought us four more halves of the smallest cherry tomatoes you've ever seen. We asked him to please take back the uneaten burrata that lacked tomatoes. We apologized for being, ""so picky,"" but did clarify that the menu does say, ""Burrata Tomato Salad."" We were cool about it, not a big deal, maybe just out of tomatoes for the evening...? When we left, we went out of our way to say, thank you and to make sure they (Dennis/bar tender and Rob/server) were good...not the other way around...? Then, after we left, we realized that they bumped us from our opentable.com reservation, marked our account as a ""no show."" Really...? We spent $70 on drinks and an appetizer and tipped them 20%, not cool. Called Rob and he apologized for his ""new hostess that didn't know what she was doing"" and he did reverse our opentable reservation status.

The staff at Hinnawi Bros are exceptionally accommodating and friendly, unlike many quick-serve establishments. 

Try a bit of the 'za'atar' sprinkled on your cream cheese bagel. It is an aromatic mix of sesame seeds, cumin, thyme, oregano and other herbs that, at first, seemed a bit strong but really made the senses dance with delight.

They have low variety, unless you want their brand of stuff.  They constantly try to push it on you. Never have the flavors you want and the staff seems to care less if you come back or not.

The menu items are similar, the classic favorites are there (Big Bloc burgers, Pimento cheese, fried pickles, etc.), although I feel the attention to detail isn't quite taken as seriously. Sanitation score could use an upgrade as well....91.5? That's pretty borderline.

I feel like they're still struggling to find their identity as well. Let the penguin be the penguin and keep their own menu, you guys should just do the blue plate thing, and do it better than anyone else; you're sort of half in-half out with both concepts. 

Also there were like 20 biker guys/gals out front when we came in (mind you it was around midnight) that were a little sketchy; they didn't really seem to be eating/drinking, more just loitering.

Everything is fantastic, just like The Donald would say.  Seriously, have you ever counted how many times he uses that word in just a 30 second timespan?

I immediately felt welcomed upon approaching the entrance here.  When I was in the lobby this continued, and upon checking in, once I yanked out my Expedia Elite card (too bad we don't get physical cards for being Yelp Elites too) they became even more welcoming, took me to the lounge, upgraded my room, extended my check-out time til 4, etc.  As for the check-in process, no, they didn't ask for my birth certificate as my form of ID (2nd Donald reference). Anyway, some of the friendliest service I've ever encountered upon checking in anywhere.

The room was, let me think of a word...how about, fantastic?  Almost made me want to stay in, since I had just arrived from a business meeting and it was 105 outside. I could barely believe that this huge room was all mine for the price, other hotels I checked out before booking were charging more than double.

Highlights include great decor, a decent view (since it's further down from the Strip, the main window view is of The Wynn), spacious, lots of drawers not just to pack your belongings away in but also already storing kitchen accessories, etc., an amazing tub/jacuzzi in the bathroom with a TV that's in the mirror, and the couches create a nice lounge area away from the bed. Basically, I had more than I needed, but I'm not complaining.

When I turned on the TV, the monitor had my name on it, but I'm surprised it had CNN as a channel since their ratings are so low (3rd Donald reference).

As for everything outside the room, the pool area was pretty basic but packed with lots of staff (will review the H2 EAU poolside dining later), the fitness center was fantastic, and The Salon was quite tempting, although I didn't see The Donald hairdo as an option on the menu (4th Donald reference).  I also like the fact this hotel has no casino, it's good to be able to have this place as an option to stay away from that scene.  The gift shop was pretty simple though.

The second day there the staff didn't seem as welcoming, like when I stepped outside they didn't offer me a cab until minutes later, and some others didn't appear as enthusiastic as those from the day before.  I don't know if it's because on the day I arrived I was dressed in my business attire, and on the following day I just had a t-shirt and shorts on, or it may have just been chance.

So, they almost got a 5 star review out of me, which would have been...fantasticest.

3-Fantastic
4-Fantasticer
5-Fantasticest",2

6862,1,1547337600000,"If I was reviewing strictly on the room I would rate a 3 because the room looked great; however, due to the unprofessional staff on site, Jordan, I didn't stay so I can't say if the bed was the best or if the shower worked so I'm not sure if the room deserves a 5.  My husband and I booked originally because the price for their best room was good and we wanted a little ""get-away"" while he was on vacation and I had some time off work prior to some medical testing.  Apparently the hotel doesn't do their own reservations so when I called I was transferred to the ""reservation"" line.  The reservation was completed, I was given a price and told we would pay at check-in. When we checked-in by Matt however, we were told something completely different, that the cost of the room plus $50 would be authorized on our credit card.  This wasn't a horrible amount so I didn't dispute it; however, I do keep very close tabs on my credit card and checked the charge later in the afternoon and it didn't match what we were told.  The amount was less than what we were told. Most people would just let this go; however, I didn't want to run into a situation where they would run additional charges later when I wasn't expecting it. 
My husband had to go to a store close-by and pick up something we forgot and stopped by the front desk to ask.  It was apparently shift change from Matt to Jordan but between Matt and Jordan neither could agree on what was being authorized and why.  Jordan was very rude and basically telling my husband that he couldn't add even after my it was made very clear the concern was that the authorization was too low and we were very aware of what the charges were supposed to be. Matt then told my husband that apparently the $50 authorization we were advised of for damages is not always $50, ""there doesn't seem to be a rhyme a reason and no one seems to know how much or how it works"".  This explanation didn't really make sense or make me feel better. Why were we told $50 at check-in and now it's ""no on knows how much or how it works""? If this company has my credit card information someone better be able to explain the how and why of the amounts they're charging.  He was given cards for management who of course weren't there and basically told to scram.
I went down to the front desk and waited behind a couple who were local and came in to book a room for someone coming into the area.  I was astonished to hear Jordan tell them (after he ran their credit card) ""There are going to be some extra charges on there for incidentals but I don't really know how much or how it works"". Really?  I usually appreciate transparency but in this case that should have been disclosed PRIOR to charging to card in case they weren't okay with ""I don't know how much or how it works"", to me that's being professional and respecting your customer.  Unfortunately it's very clear that Jordan has never been taught to respect other people and that became even more clear shortly.  Yelp does not allow enough space to describe all the unprofessional behavior that followed so I am condescending and describing what I feel others need to be aware of.  
I explained to Jordan I was uncomfortable with the ""I don't know"" explanation my husband was given; however, it became clear that he was not going to be helpful so I requested a receipt showing what was being authorized on my credit card. That was also refused. He had started out with his voice raised and ended practically yelling at me which is beyond unprofessional so I asked him to stop.  He also refused stating I was being rude so it was okay for him to be rude to me. I'm not sure why asking a representative of a business to be professional is being rude but since it was apparent that he was not going to be helpful I decided I was wasting my time and there was another guest waiting behind me.  As I turned to leave I heard a sarcastic comment so I said ""excuse me""? and he yelled ""Have a good day"" across the lobby. I knew I did not want to deal with him when I checked out the next day so I went back to the front desk and asked when he worked the next day as I didn't want to have to deal with him.  I was told ""I'm not telling you. You're threatening me now. I'm calling the police and having you removed."" Excuse me?  I specifically said I don't want to deal with you when I check out, how is that a threat? I sat down on a couch in the lobby and looked for a contact number to reach a general manager and the whole time he's yelling at me across the lobby while there are guests coming in and out.  Another employee had walked up to the desk and looked at him in shock but never said anything to Jordan.  I was finally able to speak with someone and we were advised that Jordan never called police, we were asked to stay but there was no point in staying.",2
6866,3,1548720000000,Too bad the food is terrible because this could be a nice place to go. The chips were so salty I couldn't eat them. The shrimp tacos had what tasted like 1000 island dressing on them. Tried to scrape as much off as I could. The refried beans were bland. Chicken fajitas were so dry and over cooked.

Our family hasn't chosen as to which type of pizza we prefer, Chicago, New York, California, etc.  We know we like fresh ingredients, crispy crust, lots of cheese and cold drinks. You definitely get all that and great service at Nello's.

Fresh pizza does take a while longer to prepare than chain par-baked dough.  The salads are huge and are full of flavor.  An there's always a favorite on tap.  We enjoyed the Four Peaks Peach Ale.

They have an expansive patio with greenery and signs all over stating rules: no running, no screaming, no throwing, no gymnastics, no climbing, no no no etc. I forgot to take a picture of the sign. We were one of the first tables outside and it took over 40 minutes to get our food. Our coffee was lukewarm when it was brought out. We had to hunt down our server to ask him what was going on. The food was brought out, finally, with no apology, and it was cold. We talked to the hostesses on the way out and then a insincere apology was made. This restaurant is in a family neighborhood and it should be family friendly. I'm very disappointed. I gave it 2 stars for the beautiful patio and ok tasting food.

After having an appointment scheduled for a month, he was on the way to the appointment when they called to ""reschedule"".  They rescheduled 3 weeks out from the 1st appt.  When he went yesterday, they couldn't really find anything wrong with his teeth, but said he should get his wisdom teeth out while he's young and then they would clean his teeth at the next appointment.  He said it was hard sell all the way and never got his teeth cleaned after all that hassle.  I called and asked to speak to the office manager, she was not available and never called me back.  This is clearly bait and switch marketing through groupon which is just not right.  If you buy a service, it should be provided.

It is January 18th and it said that they tried to deliver a package on January 4th but they left no note. I have made calls to Sq. HIll, East Liberty and 1800 USPS and no one can find my package. This happened at least 4 times to me last year. 
The package was not delivery signature required, it was just a normal medium sized box that weighed practically nothing. 
And do they ever actually do anything about giving the insurance amount? NO way, it's somehow the customer's fault that they didn't deliver the package. The only time I got a refund was when the seller felt bad and refunded my purchase price after I spent 3 months trying to get someone to just look for the package. The thing is that you can call, you can go in in person and no one will even look to see if there's a package with your name in the back. This is why I use FedEx when I'm sending a package. In all these years I have had only one issue with FedEx and they immediately took care of it in a friendly and constructive manner. Surely, USPS could at least take a look to see if they have my box or answer the phone. Something.",2

Answered every question imaginable and was able to set me up with the right plan that fit into my budget.

We go in and they refuse to get us seated (again, it was 20 minutes before close and we went there only for ice cream), and they condescendingly tell us to get it in to-go cups.

6933,3,1547596800000,I may be a bit drunk but something that I take very passionately is good customer service. My issue with this place or better yet service in particular is that our waiter was completely awful. Food was fantastic and the reason why I'm making this review is because I want waiters to make their money but our waiter did the complete opposite of that. He didn't spend anytime with us asking about our night but he took the time to build rapport with the two groups behind us. Which is rude. Not only that I wanted more drinks since getting there and never once asked if I wanted another one after my first. Just awful service by a that one guy. Would never consider going to this place ever again.,2
6937,3,1548547200000,"I had read the reviews, and hit and miss, but we are not fussy and kind of like ""old school"" kind of places so decided to give it a try.  Checked in on Thursday late afternoon.  The clerk gave us an upgrade since it was our honeymoon.  We took our luggage up, changed and then headed out to check out Fremont Street.  Got back after midnight and just crashed after a long day of driving.  Friday morning I opened our curtains wide to see the view, and got to see the view of our room at the same time.  There was a very suspicious splatter on the headboard of one of the beds - didn't take much imagination to know what it had to be.  Beyond disgusted we went downstairs to show them the picture I took.  The clerk said ""that is disgusting"", and got us another room.  He then offered to refund $10.00 off our bill for the resort fee.  Gee thanks. That fixes everything lol.  We moved quickly and went on with our stay.  I would have moved hotels but everything else such short notice seemed to be booked.  Upon arriving home last night I noticed I left my bracelet in the first room, so I called the hotel.  Yes, they said, they did find my bracelet (tennis bracelet) and after charging my credit card $25.00 they would be happy to ship it to me.  I told them I left it in my haste to get away from the ""sperm room"" it didn't matter.  Customer service is not this hotels strong point.  Neither is cleaning.  On a side note, our room came with two very small bath soaps, I mean VERY small.  We used one in the sink area, and the other in the shower Saturday morning.  Going that extra mile, we saw the housekeeper did not feel the need to give us another after cleaning our room for the rest of the day or the next day - so we were very careful not to get too carried away using soap.  WOW.  In all fairness, the second room wasn't bad - get what we paid for - but the first room is stuck in my mind forever....",2

We were seated and our waiter (appeared to be) very very nice and charming.  He spoke with us about the menu and we had a little small talk also.  Everything on the menu looked so good that we had trouble deciding what to order.  We ended up choosing the roasted duck poutine pizza.  They told us the pizza was very larger and suggested us to share it, so we ordered an appetizer to go with that instead or another entree.  Both food items were amazing and the waiter was amazing as well.  When we finished, we paid for our food and left a 20% tip.  The waiter seemed to either be unhappy about his tip or decided that he does not have to serve us anymore because we paid and tipped.  He pretty much ignored us...which felt a bit strange since he was the friendliest person just before.  Even when we left, he looked the other way and my friend went up to him and said bye.  We were a bit offended how he completely ignored us 100% after the bill.  Usually waiters would at least say BYE, have a good night!  We just felt he was a bit fake.",2

Its also in an unassuming location in the middle of a strip mall so keep your eyes out for the big sign that says they've been on The Food Network otherwise you might just drive on by.

While waiting for our reservation time we sat in the dining area. They offer a full menu and have a full bar. We didn't try any of the food as we just arrived from dinner. A friend of mine ordered the poutine and she said it was good.

The soccer pool concept is different which makes it quite intriguing. It was very fun to play with a group for the 55 mins we got. We had 8 people playing and were able to fit in 3 full games. Be careful not to kick the balls too hard or else you might knock over someone's drink or even break it.

6957,1,1546560000000,"I have an compulsive habit of finding certain clothing items and obsessing over them until I either cave in and buy it or seek professional help. 

This time it was a pair of Frye boots that cost $380 and in Toronto were only sold at Bootmaster. I would call and see if they had my specific obsession in stock. They told me they didn't but they had a similar pair. I went in several times and stared and stared at them. I never bought them, I never even tried them on because I knew I wouldn't be able to leave without buying them and then I'd have to explain to my landlord why I was trying to pay my rent in air miles. 

Anyway, Bootmaster has a HUGE selection of boots - frye boots are definitely their more modern and in my opinion, more stylish boots. But they also have a ton of authentic cowboy boots, which you'll discover when you walk in the store and are pummelled in the face with that beautiful smell of fresh leather. The people working there were always really helpful (on the phone or in person) and if I had the money, I would definitely give them my business. 

If you want a pair of well-made, stylish and beautiful boots, I recommend you check out the Frye line they sell here (apparently they're the only 
Ontario retailer).  And if you see the knee-high Veronica slouch boots, tell them I say hi.",2

The actual road going through the conservation area is narrow but it's one way so who cares. There are lots of places to pull over and enjoy the view. You can also scale the actual rocks if you're feeling brave. I totally recommend getting out of the car and really getting up close and personal.

I always get the iced toddy, and really haven't tried anything else. But with that being said, their iced toddy is freakin' bomb. When I lived in San Francisco, a lot of the good coffee places had a very particular 'gingerbread-like'  flavour to their coffees, something I have not been able to find in AZ. But this iced toddy is exactly like that, and it's heaven! Would highly recommend it.

I was soooo looking forward to trying it out and having a wonderful experience but I ended up short. Our waiter was very attentive in the beginning but then he got distracted by a party of girls who either had too much to drink or were just normally extremely outgoing and forward with their conversation. In any case, they were chatting and chatting and chatting and stiiill chatting by the time we had finally set our menus down because we were tired of waiting to order. Their chat probably went on for a good 10-15 minutes in front of our table without our orders having been taken. I didn't worry about it too much but by the end, I was getting frustrated. I know our waiter was probably giving us time to review the menu, but it still seemed a little excessive. Once we ordered, our food did not take too long to arrive but it was definitely mediocre and did not give off a fresh taste. I asked for my food to be prepared spicy and that request was accommodated. We had a restaurant.com coupon and I gave it to our waiter prior to his preparation of our bill. I did not realize a certain percentage of tip was automatically included in the bill until I went to add the tip myself. It appears they automatically added 18%. Now, this is annoying to me. I know some people may not tip properly but I am a regular 20%+ tipper and while our service was not exactly stellar, I probably still would have left a very generous amount (on the full bill, not just the discounted price). Needless to say, I did not add any additional tip to our bill. Don't think I'll ever be going back to this place- not necessarily because the food or atmosphere is bad, but just because the food is not worth the money (you can get similar tasting food at a cheaper Indian buffet place) and the service wasn't the best. As I said, I am feeling very heavy with disappointment just writing this review and it's not even my business! I had high expectations and was super excited to finally try this place but it wasn't all I thought it would be.",2

We had an arctic char salad and grouper sandwich ($9.75 each). 
The dish presentation was nice quite. The salad had the usual suspects, along with grilled asparagus and nice balasmic dressing.

As such, I've definitely had better sushi elswhere, but I think this place does have the best sushi in the area. As compared with others, Kofusion has a decent medium-sized selection of rolls. In addition, one dollar sushi definitely is enticing and worth your money. But if you don't go during one dollar sushi hours, it gets a bit pricey, as it should. 

I do believe that Kofusion's ambiance is interesting. It's a darker place, with glimmers of neon lights, kind of like a classy club.",2

I was at wits end with Discount Tire who after two visits could not simply get my tire balanced properly.  Reviews were not great from this Meineke but I went for a simple oil change to check them out myself.  They were so kind and welcoming I felt like their friend.  Johnny pointed out to me my struts were blown out and needed immediate attention (I already knew this, it was part of the test).  He gave me a very fair estimate and I scheduled the service.  He even worked with me on a ride while my car was in for the day.  I am so happy I have found my car care expert.  After 2 months of driving, I love my car's handling again, especially the tires that they balanced perfectly with no issue.  I cannot say enough good about Johnny as a human and the care both myself and my car received.

Our waitress came 2 min after being seated to offer water, the ordering was easy (we went for the $16 buffet breakfast) and the selection was really good. From smoked salmon, fruit salads, chicken and waffles to omelettes of your choice, I am sure you'll find something to brighten up your sunday morning!

7110,3,1547424000000,"Customer service: poor. Policy: poor.
I pre-paid for an Avis rental in August. I even called ahead of my arrival to ensure everything was in order, and I was assured it was. When I arrived in Calgary, I was denied the rental due to their confusion re: my credit card. They insisted they would not accept a debit card, and I attempted to explain that mine functioned as a credit card, with a Visa logo showing on the card. The rep already made up her mind, and refused to rent me the car, despite that I had already paid. It was a nightmare.

Given that it was 1 a.m., there was no manager for me to talk with, and no public transportation to take me downtown. I was left without transportation for the weekend, a great inconvenience given all I needed to accomplish. 

I have used Avis around Canada and the U.S. I had never been treated as poorly as I was by this location. When I called Avis to complain, they informed me they were only going to refund me a portion because of the cost to reserve the car in the first place. I was outraged. It took me two weeks before an Avis representative agreed to refund my money.

So poor was my experience that I will never use Avis at this location ever again.",2

7118,2,1546819200000,"Food: good value for price. Lots of variety. Dumplings are freshly made to order, but ultimately nothing special IMO. Steamed and fried varieties available (I only tried the steamed). Personally I am also not really a fan of the Chinese-style dumpling wrap, which tends to be a bit on the thicker side. Green onion pancakes are unique and quite good. I also like the shredded potato (appetizer).

Service: spotty at best, but it gets the job done. Could be a challenge for non-Chinese speakers (they did have both Cantonese and Mandarin-speaking servers when I was there). You just order everything by ticking off a paper menu anyways, so server interaction is minimal.

Space: very limited, tight seating. Come during a busy night (e.g. weekends) and you'll most likely have to wait 30 minutes for a table.",2
7137,2,1547683200000,"Had mounting done by these guys a few weeks ago. Was quoted a price but then told that since they had to spend extra time to put the mounts together, i would be charged more. Ended up paying extra and even purchased a mount from them to make up for the inconvenience.

Why the 3 stars? Well, the wires that were behind the tv were hidden ""behind the tv"". They were not concealed completely. I moved the TV and all the wires fell down. No zip ties were used for the wires. A really sloppy job for as much money as I paid. 

Would I recommend them? Sure, they are nice guys, especially Jason's partner! But would I get the mounts installed by them again? Probably not. Better paying Amazon or Best Buy a little bit more and having them do the installs.",3
7137,3,1547856000000,"Overall:   I have lived at 618 Gorham for about two years. They have been worst landlords I have experienced in my lifetime. Last year they raised the rent 8% and this year they raised the rent 10%. I was not stupid enough to stick around for a third year, because I am sure they are jacking the rent up again (average is 2.5% for Madison). I guess they would rather keep turning over tenants then keeping people happy. Out of 8 units 6 or 7 have turned over in the two years I have been there. They had to show my place about 30 times before they found someone willing to pay the rent increases. This business model may maximize the amount they can jack up the rent every year, but it really makes for a slummy apartment where nobody stays. Also, they are constantly showing your place, and even going through my closets, so it feels very intrusive. I suppose some of this is unavoidable, but I would much rather find a place that wants me to stay. 

On maintenance:     While the maintenance guys are nice, don't expect any real fixes to happen, because they are not allowed to spend money. Our basement window leaks water when it rains and they guy basically said it was too expensive to fix, so we will just leave it. I have the only apartment without an double door on the front. They said it broke before I moved in and they are no longer installing new ones. There has been a gutter broken (badly) and dropping water two stories and eroding the ground around the foundation. The CHT solution is not to fix the gutter, but to throw rocks and construction waste down to refill the eroded ground. I guess replacing a ten foot run of gutters is too expensive as well. At least they come out quickly, which is good considering the undersized ass drains constantly clog and have to be snaked out. I never had this problem before and my neighbors have the same problem. The maintenance guy says one apartment needs their drains snaked every week. 

In conclusion:    They are slum lords. I suspect that they are planning on tearing down this building or something, because they don't seem to care about keeping the building up. This would also explain why they keep jacking up the rent. They probably want people to move out, so they can rebuild and compete with the new building going up. No doubt they will try to grab my security deposit and I will have to fight for that as well.",2
7139,1,1548115200000,"My friends and I were very excited to try Poros for a birthday celebration. The decor and overall look of the restaurant was beautiful!!!!! One of the nicest decor in Pittsburgh. I give a 5 on ambiance. 

We made reservations a month in advance for 11 people and waited 25 minutes to still be seated. Manager was nice and gave us 6 free appetizers for our wait. We got the flatbread, octopus, and 3 dips. The appetizers were not bad. Tzatziki was the best and the octopus was delicious. The other dips were average... Like it came out of a pre-packaged container. The flatbread was also OK. We kept having to ask for Pita bread because they gave only 2 full pitas for 11 people....

After asking the server what she recommends and is the most popular dish she said it was the Crispy Dorade (chef speciality). 
The fish was supposed to be stuffed with crab meat and have greens on top. The Greens were wilted and old looking. The crab meat tasted as though it came out of a can. The fish itself tasted like it was freezer burned. Nothing about my dish was good and I was extremely disappointed in the quality- being that it was $32 and had all the potential to be delicious. Other people at the table took a bite and immediately spit it out. I had 3 bites and that was it. Very very poor food quality. 

My husband got the octopus small plate and shrimp saganaki. Having went to several Greek restaurants the saganaki tasted like spaghetti sauce with feta crumbles on top. I have never seen something like that. It had barely any cheese  and saganaki is primarily a cheese dish and does not have spaghetti sauce in it. Gross. 

A couple people at the table got the scallops and lobster tail. Another disappointment. The lobster tail was cooked so much you could not get the meat out of the shell. The scallops were also over cooked. 

I got wine and a cocktail. It was the best part of the night. 5 people took there food back and the server did not seem to care at all.

I asked for my tab and waited 25 minutes and still did not get the tab. I had to get up and ask a different server finally for my tab. We started dinner at 8:45pm and did not leave from there until 12am because of how long everything took. It was not even a busy night on the restaurant side. 

Overall I would be VERY surprised if this restaurant stays open for very long. I think they need experienced servers and much better chefs. 
They should have put the money into the quality of the food rather than so much into the decor. Huge disappointment. 
 Lastly, the birthday girl was puking 2 hours later after eating at Poros. Bad sign.

Do not go and dine there. If you want to, just get drinks and maybe a few small plates. There are PLENTY of fantastic restaurants in Pittsburgh to choose from... this is just not one of them.",2

1.   There are 3+ night clubs in the immediate area.  You will hear them all weekend until 2am.  In your room.  As if you were inside the club.  

2.  The AC is almost as noisy as the club.  It kicks on and off all night.  

3.   Our friends had a res for double occupancy for months.  On checkin they got a room with 1 bed and a rollaway bed was hauled up.  It's not really the same thing tho.  

4.  The worst part was when we asked for a cab to the airport.  They got us a town car instead.  The rate ($55) ended up being double the cost of the cab in from the airport ($28).  Make sure to ask first and book your own ride.

the last time i was here, my FABULOUS date and i enjoyed the ""Big Night"" option on the menu.  i also ordered a bottle of some the sweet champagne (Asti Spumante) from Martini and Rossi.  we started off with bread cubes, vegatables, and apples to dip in the traditional  swiss cheese fondue melted right in front of us.  this was followed by a strawberry -almond salad, which used the sweetness of strawberries to accent the tangy balsamic vinegar.  for our entree we ordered the lobster Indulgence, which included lobster tails, beef sirloin, black tiger shrimp, citrus-marinated pork tenderloin, breast of chicken, and whew some roasted vegetable ravioli to dip in a special broth.  i loved all the different tons of dipping sauces, because i just love to dip those little bastards of lobsters, beef, or chicken into some tasty tangy flavors.   we finished it off with the tropical coconut rum chocolate fondue.  i really wanted to dip a spoon in there and just eat it straight out of the pot.  it came with a plate of bananas, marshmallows, pound cake, strawberries, pineapple chunks, brownies and cheesecake.  actually, if it were allowed i would have liked to dip my date in it, too....ooh yummy!!! 

yeah, this meal was pretty good, and pretty heavy on the stomach.  i would recommend to go light on the appetizer, maybe skip the salad, try the entree, but it is a must to make it to the dessert!!!",2

For the prices of the food, you would think you would have more then a plastic chair to sit in.  One of the people helping to serve food, I think is one of the managers, actually needs a class on how to serve, sorry grasping my glass by the rim is not a proper way to serve a drink.  Also you need to wash your hands before serving food after counting money.  The cleaning bottle for the tables was on the same counter as the serving counter/mixing area for drinks.

I was here for the 2010 Canadian Gran Prix and the price was about $500 USD a night (yikes!) but was about the best I could find for location during the event. Parking was another $25 a day :-( .The staff were very nice and helpful. The location is pretty close to nice nightlife locations and closer to the subway entrance. The rooms are slightly dated and could use a refresh. Our windows were sealed so we couldn't really get any fresh air in the room so it was either stuffy or super cold as made by the A/C.

7204,1,1547942400000,"I live Walking distance from this place and have driven by on my way to and from work everyday and there always seemed to be lots or cars in the parking lot. So i kept telling myself i would go check it out. So last night we decided to go out to dinner and a drink and I figured what better way to do it than going to the village pub. 

As soon as you walk in there is a restaurant type dining area to the right and the bar seating to your left. We walked in at about 6:50 and happy hour apparently ends at 7:00 but the bar tender gave us all happy hour prices on our drinks which is $2 beer and $2 well drinks as well as $2 off all appetizers, which is a sweet deal when the most expensive app is like $6. We tried the stuffed potato wedges which are delicious, my wife ordered the Fish and Chips and I ordered the Pub burger...

As for the fish and chips..... "" WOW""  absolutely amazing. Definitely not the type of fish and chips you expect in the middle of the desert. 
The Burger was also Very Very good, cooked exactly how I asked and it was very tasty.  This is now a go to place, we had 2 drinks an appetizer and 2 meals for $26 and won $25 on the keno machine at the bar so in all reality we payed $1 for an amazing meal.  Oh and i almost forgot, they have a 24 hour full menu... SO if you are thinking about getting some food late The neighbor Roberto's is not the only choice..",2

7218,3,1547769600000,"I haven't eaten a lot of sushi in Toronto (I only come occasionally), and I've generally been spoiled by eating a lot of sushi in Japan.  

So why give Kokoro 4 stars?  

Because it's excellent - both in terms of value and taste - for what it is.  

It's not on par with great sushi in Japan, but I wouldn't really expect somewhere in Toronto to be great - particularly not for the inexpensive prices Kokoro charges.  

That sounds (even to me) like I'm trying to justify why I liked Kokoro, but honestly, it's more about knowing what to expect, particularly for sushi.  Great sushi-quality fish is expensive in North America, so when I get very good sushi at a very good price (like at Kokoro), I'm always impressed.

We had exclusively rolls (salmon, tuna, rainbow, etc.), since I usually need to trust somewhere a bit more before I get much nigiri.  And every roll was very good.  

I particularly like that Kokoro does NOT offer a huge selection, because I find that to often be the downfall of a place like this.  Kokoro sticks to a few selections of fish, all of which are fairly fresh.  And the fish-to-rice ratio is very good.  

Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.",3

Stopped here with a group of 7 for before-the-game food and drinks for the ACC championship game.  Had to wait a bit for a table, but that was expected.  Once seated, the service was spotty to poor.  I think they had enough servers to cover, but our server would disappear for long stretches of time.
 
Good beer selection, but they were out of a lot of it.  On a Saturday night.  Took several tries to get someone, ANYone, to bring us a missing set of silverware.  Oh, and the ketchup.  Oh, and where is the wrap that we ordered the same time as all the other food?  Remember that non-chipotle-ranch you were supposed to bring 15 minutes ago?

I understand its grilled I get that but smashed is not what it should be ...anyhow , thank God for the 50 ℅ of mailer because my mediocre , smashed sandwich and soup would have been $ 10.86 instead of the five dollars I paid for it !

A friend of mine found out I was in Vegas for my birthday and all he said was make sure you go to Mastro's Ocean Club for the warm butter cake. I was like ok...I'll try it.  He was like no, you better try it.

So, I was on a hunt to try this warm butter cake.  To my surprise, my hotel is literally across the street from the place. 

We get to the place at 11:30pm and the hostess tells us we're closed and we're bummed.  Bummed because we're scheduled to leave tomorrow and wouldn't have the chance to try it.  We begged to just sit at the bar and see if they would let us order dessert. She said sure...YAY :)

Got to the bar, looked at the menu and the bartender said you have to try our signature dessert dish and we said ok but we're here for one thing and he said the warm butter cake and we were like YES!!!!!

When it came out it was sooo beautiful.  To cute to cut!!! The cuteness didn't last long.  We took our first bite and OMG...decadence!!!! It was mouth watering. It was fabulous. It was soooooooo sweet and so good.  i could feel my sugar levels going up but I didn't care :)

Gotta try it!!!",2
7250,2,1546646400000,"James Combes is an awesome PA, unfortunately I can't say the same about their billing practices and front office staff. After leaving THREE voicemails with their automated system letting them know I was trying to pay the bill they sent me, I received a statement that said my balance was overdue. The next time I called I got a live person who said they were not able to assist but they could transfer me to the billing clerks voicemail as she was in a meeting at the time. I left another voicemail for her. After a week, I still did not hear anything back from the office so I called again and got another staff member who gave me the same story only this time I asked for her to write a physical note as my voicemails were not being answered. Another week went by and I still had no luck and received another statement saying my balance was overdue. When I finally received a call back from the employee, while cordial, told me that I should have just come in to pay the bill. I told her I understood but that I had called several times, we don't attend the office anymore, and that the office is out of our way and there is no reason why they shouldn't have called us back for payment. Then when I informed this employee that I was only going to pay a portion of the total bill she said that billing may not accept the payment as it was ""severely past due"". I almost laughed! I then went through the process of telling her how I had taken the initiative and called them SIX times before I was able to make payment.

You would think this would have been enough, but then she informed me that I could pay online and so I looked at their website and it has a ""make payment"" button. I clicked on it and filled out the information and submitted only to find out that it sent a message (mind you this was not a secure https payment platform) to the staff. I have yet to receive a confirmation by phone, text, email, or mail that they have received my payment by their website.

***Long story short, they provide great care and are friendly but have some serious issues with their billing. 4 stars for medical care, -2 stars for billing***",2
7254,3,1547078400000,"You get what you pay for...

This place is fairly cheap for a massage. I guess my expectations were just too high(?).

I think the real problem is the ""language barrier"" on multiple levels. My Mandarin is actually OK. I understood some of the gossiping going on between the ladies working on me and my wife. But in addition to the Mandarin/English issues, I had more of a problem with that they didn't seem to pay much attention to our requests.  My wife came in complaining about her lower back and I told them specifically about my elbow pain.  But those areas only got an extra 3-4 minutes of attention. Other than those slight deviations, they stuck to their regular schedule: 

first 15 minutes: face and head
next 15 minutes: arms
next 15 minutes: feet 
last 15 minutes: back/neck

I figure they waste half the time because they don't take the few extra seconds to take individual customers' needs into account.

If you don't mind the above routine, it's probably just fine. And the price is low enough. So it could have been worse. 

On the bright side, Vivian followed up with a text message, asking for our feedback. So hopefully things will be better for others in the future...",2

Han's has, needless to say, been a favourite of ours for years and a couple of past attempts at retirement and handover went so poorly that Mei and Han had to take the restaurant back. Today, we ordered our favourites (chicken with spicy sauce and the fried green beans) along with a cold celery dish that sounded interesting. I'm happy and relieved to report that it was all superb... amazing actually. The simple celery dish was magnificent; made with extreme care, blanched and tender but not close to mushy with a simple dressing of light soy sauce and sesame oil, I think. Delicious. The hot mains were absolutely stunning- we ate every bite and enjoyed them all. Service was very friendly if a bit slow because three parties, us among them, showed up at the same time, but it was very much worth the wait. Such a fantastic meal.

Their menu is quite limited but thats a good thing for indecisive patrons like myself.  I tried all their spices of chicken and fries but nothing wowed me like what I have heard.  I might have set my expectation a little too high for Nandos.  The quality is definitely there but the recipe can use some tweaking.

I left feeling a little disappointed and sort of wish I had spent my money on Popeye's chicken or KFC; I know I know its not the same but they all specialize in chicken.

Drove past his shop and saw that there was a piece missing from my 8x11 slab.  Wouldn't return any of my polite texts/phone messages.  After my 4th attempt to find him at his shop and speaking with one of the workers there, I got a call from the stoneyard saying that he was dropping off my slab back at the original location (without responding to any of my inquiries).  Unsure if slab is usable for my purpose and manager at stoneyard said the break looked like someone dropped it or hit it when transporting.  Cristian finally texted me back after I called him out on returning a broken slab, but no attempt from him to rectify that I will have to buy a new slab and identify a new fabricator after waiting 6 weeks for him to get to this point.",3

Room was fine.  Bed comfortable.  Uncarpeted but quite clean as was the bathroom.  Great location on the strip.  Grounds have nice gardens with several animals living in the habitat including Flamingos. Great historic pool area.  Elevators are pretty quick.

Cons-
Most upsetting were all the hidden fees after you arrive, if you are the regular folk without special gambling status.  Whatever you pay for the room, you can add another $42+ for each day you stay if you drive to Las Vegas.  Internet hookup is bad.  Yes they even charge full price $8 for self-parking if you are staying in the hotel.

CONS
I was very limited on what I could eat but if you like red meats and oxtail dishes you may like this place.  My only options were pretty much the papaya salad and the fish tacos.  Fish tacos were super tiny and both were pretty forgettable, unfortunately.

The second time I came here the service was horrendous. The cashier carried on a full conversation for at least 2 minutes without even asking us if we were ready to order. Additionally, once we started ordering, the cashier continued a different conversation in between asking me about what I wanted to order!

7339,2,1547596800000,"As a party planner, I do not gratuitously provide 5-Star Ratings. However, I believe Mastro's Ocean Club to be the perfect location for an intimate dinner party in Las Vegas. We booked the private rooms upstairs for a reception and sit-down dinner for a party of 40 on Saturday, September 15, 2012 and our discerning guests who came from all around the country could not have been more pleased with the entire experience.  We were expertly guided from start to finish by Carly Smith, Director of Events. Carly was assessable, professional, flexible and an essential resource regarding local vendors to compliment the comprehensive services offered by Mastro's.  The ambiance was charming and elegant... photos of the gorgeous chandeliers, golden leather seats and flat screens which are viewable on their website, do not do this venue any justice.  We were in full view of the delightfully lit Tree House and even the restrooms which came with very courteous attendants, were a pleasant surprise. Their technology is also top of the line. All we needed to do was bring our slide show on a flash drive and our iPad playlist and our music soared through the rooms and our slideshow displayed brilliantly on two flat screens. Mastro's provided all of the equipment and cords and made it easy for us to make our party truly surround sound fun!  No event is a success without delicious food and this is where Mastro's clearly shines brightly. We started with an extraordinary Seafood Tower and Brochetta during the reception. Guests could not get enough of the Colossal Shrimp and Split/Chilled Alaskan King Crab Legs and the wait staff kept everyone's wine glass full which added to the fun and excitement during the reception. As we moved into dinner, the asparagus tempura seemed to disappear from the tables as guests ordered their choice of salads and entrees. And, talk about entrees...the generous portions of prepared-to-order salmon, chicken, steak or sword fish provided additional shock and awe. Even the side dishes, sautéed mushrooms, sautéed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious. In addition to Carly Smith, we also have the highest praise Sherie Ritzler, General Manager, Brandon S., Banquet Captain, as well as, L.R, Alex and all of the wait staff and hostesses.",2

After trying a couple more rolls I was a bit done with the food and was looking forward to dessert. Sadly mochi ice cream was only served for dinner. For the price that I paid, it definitely wasn't worth it.

Our coffees came out first and then a while later, the food. The portion size again was great, enough for two meals. I accidently spilled the syrup all over the plate, and I don't like my eggs in syrup so they brought me a smaller plate to which I could transfer the eggs.

Nick Fisher was the guy that sold us the car and he was a stud. Very different from most car salesman and not trying to pressure us or anything. There were a couple of managers that helped us as well and I don't remember their names but they were very helpful and friendly as well. They were super willing to work with us and definitely earned our business. 

Not only was the buying experience exceptional, but just as my luck would have it, 4 days after I purchased the car someone decided to hit my back bumper and scratch it up pretty good and not tell me. In a phone call with nick I told him about what happened, and he went above and beyond to get us some touch up paint and clear coat when he totally didn't even need to.

7448,1,1547510400000,"I finally found a sushi that I like! Went tonight 1-8-16 for their $25.95 AYCE around 6:30 PM. This restaurant is located adjacent to the Target shopping center on Maryland and Flamingo.  Shout-out to my Yelp pal Gregg W. who just happened to stroll in while we were chowing down!    
The ambiance is casual but their food is totally upscale.  I was amazed at how quickly the food came out!  Seriously we must not have waited 2 minutes for our food and it was all hot and fresh and delicious.   
Items selected: 
Scallop & bacon skewer- Delicious.  Bacon was crispy and scallops were tiny but sumptuous.  
Shrimp tempura- Best I've ever had.  Hot, crunchy, salty, delicious.  I could eat them all day. 
The shit- wonderful.  Spicy, crunchy, hot, crabby.  I wanted 20 more immediately. 
Edamame- Best I've ever had.  Piping hot, salty, perfectly steamed. Yassss.  
Chicken fried rice- Wonderful flavor.  Good size portion for AYCE.  
Japchae- Stir-fried glass noodles with shredded carrots.  Delicious flavor and piping hot. 
Pang- YUCK.  Tastes like hot mayo and crab.  Not for me.  Gagged a little bit. 
Something wrong roll- The first sushi I've ever liked.  I'm go glad I tried it.  It had tuna, salmon, and shrimp tempura.  If you go, you have to try this.  I loved it. 
Mini honey toast- Amazing.  Toasted block of bread with honey and ice cream.  Get five of these.  The ice cream is something special...it's super white vanilla (like the inside of a Klondike bar).

Our party of 2 generally each order a set lunch, which comes with a soup and a drink.  They're about $7-8 which is a tad bit higher than the price at some other places, but still a well reasonable lunch budget.  The vibe and atmosphere here is a lot more low-key than most other HongKong style restaurants.  Their food portions are what you would expect, not too large, not too small, and each person can typically finish their plate without trouble.  

The service really changes from time to time, and it's honestly all random,  Sometimes the waitresses will be very keen and but other times, they can be extremely ignorant and frustrating to deal with, so it's honestly just a bit of luck in all of this.

7474,1,1547769600000,"A five, a five, and another five. So many fives. Gallagher's is so good. Simply put, probably the best steak I've ever eaten.

The menu claimed that the aged Strip was their trademark, but I went ahead and ordered a filet mignon. A few moments after I regretted my decision, but after taking a bite, I was really glad that I ordered what I did. The filet mignon has an incredible crust on the outside, and my steak was cooked just about as I ordered it (medium rare) on the inside. I say ""just about"" because parts of mine were a bit rare, but not raw, so I wasn't at all picky about it. I also opted to get their chowder as an appetizer, had a side of green beans with my steak, and tried the calamari -- which was my first time ever having it. Oh yeah, I also had some mac and cheese.

All really excellent. If you haven't eaten calamari, I'll just tell you that (at least in this case) it's a very mild almost nonexistent flavored flavor with a slightly chewy but tender texture to it. The appearance of tentacles may gross you out if you order it, but trust me, it's good eats. The mac and cheese was also great and had a nice little bitterness to it to keep the already rich cheese from being over the top. I often tend to much prefer baked mac and cheese, but Gallagher's is some of the best non-baked mac and cheese I've had. The chowder was delicious as well, and was probably my favorite I've ever had until I wound up having some in Seattle, but that's for another review. I really liked the fact that it was a bit on the thinner side, because super thick chowders just aren't my thing. I didn't get much of a bacon flavor, but I did get a bacon smokiness which was fantastic.

Gallagher's is expensive. If you couldn't guess that by it being a steakhouse in Vegas, you'd hopefully guess it based on the look of the place. I will tell you that everything about Gallagher's is phenomenal. It was a bit too warm for comfort sitting next to the kitchen, but everything about it was awesome. I'd like to try another ""fancy"" restaurant the next time in Vegas, but it'd be hard for me to go somewhere other than Gallagher's when I know it's so damn delicious.",3

Staff was friendly and really wanted to make your experience enjoyable. They have a few variety of fish/marinate to choose from, and I had the 'always lit.' Fish was marinated pretty well and there was a lot of mix-ins and toppings available. However i found there was a bit too much rice, so the ratio didn't feel right. The whole bowl ended being a bit bland in the end, so I sort of wish they'd ask if you wanted to have sauce on top of it. Still it was a pretty good experience , and I definitely recommend giving it a try.",2

I ordered the Martinez which is like an old fashion but made with gin...this is a must try!

For food I ordered the mushroom ramen, which was to die for! I rarely order ramen, but plan to order it from here every chance I get. The broth is not too thick and very flavorful! My friends all ordered meat dishes, which they loved but I couldn't sample since I don't eat meat.

7493,1,1547510400000,"Satay is something rather ubiquitous in my home country of Australia. Being situated close to South East Asia we have quality Asian restaurants in the same way the South Western United States enjoys incredible Mexican food. Satay dishes are so commonplace that in Australia they appear on the menu at regular Chinese restaurants.

Living in Vegas now I've missed satay and even though Malaysian satay (my preference) can be hard to find, Thai satay is an acceptable alternative. Panna Thai takes that alternative and makes it in the best possible way.

Every time we go here I order the Satay Chicken as a dinner portion and both sauce and chicken are incredible. It comes served with egg fried rice and the standard little cucumber salad and is delicious from first bite to last. The chicken is exquisitely basted and marinaded and the peanut sauce perfection itself.

When my wife and I go here we usually enjoy the vegetable summer rolls as a pleasant, fresh appetizer to share and she raves about her vegetarian pad thai with fried tofu. 

I've also ordered the BBQ pork noodle soup which is similarly tasty, but overkill when you're ordering a big plate of Satay.

Service is always attentive and friendly.

My only real gripe with Panna Thai is their lack of a fountain drinks machine and the requirement to buy cans of Coke (or whatever) if you want something non-alcoholic other than filtered tap water. This, of course, means no soda refills.

Overall though, Panna Thai is a great option. Their menu might not be as extensive as some, but they have more than enough to satisfy everyone.",2

7503,3,1546300800000,"This was a really fun experience during my trip to Vegas.  It's not one of the bigger helicopter expeditions where they fly you off to the Hoover Dam or Grand Canyon but it is still a nice way to get a good look at the strip from above and more fun than a bus tour or any tour on the ground.

The service was pretty good all the way around.  A shuttle bus/cargo van will pick you up from your hotel or another hotel destination and take you out to the airport in North Vegas.  This was the one weird part about the experience and that had some of the people I did the tour with feeling nervous.  A friend of mine booked the tour through a Groupon or Livingsocial deal and it was hard to even confirm that the thing was purchased, randomly my friend received a text message saying to meet at a certain place and time for the ride to the airport, people in the group thought it was shady but I wasn't overly concerned.

When we did arrive for the shuttle, we were met by two nice ladies who would be our driver/tour guides from the trip from the strip to the airport. Both were really fun and loose and gave a few tips and nuggets about the city of Las Vegas, they also spent time just having general conversation with each other which was fine.

We arrived at the airport and the staff there was friendly and welcoming as well; we were served champagne while we waited for everything to be set up.  A staff member drives you out to the airport from the hanger in a nice party bus style shuttle, which was cool as well.

Once you get to the actual helicopter you may get a little nervous, the helicopter is small, not like a giant police or news team helicopter.  It only seats 4, 1 being the pilot so you either have to go 3 people up at a time depending on size of your party.  They also weigh you at the airport so depending on how much you weigh it could be a factor in whom you are allowed to fly with, the helicopter needs to be balanced.

When you  get to the helicopter, you're literally strapped in in a minute and given a headset so you can communicate with the pilot as well as your fellow passengers, it also lets you listen it to the air traffic controller which is pretty cool.  Also be prepared because this particular helicopter does not have any doors and the wind is whipping pretty hard.

After a quick introduction with the pilot we were off and up.  You fly up to about 300 feet and are given a real bird's eye view of the strip, this is a strip tour so it's not overly long, from the time you leave the hanger, go up and out over the strip and come back is only about 20 minutes but it still a very fun experience.

I definitely recommend it for anyone who is looking for something fun and new to do; it'll be well worth the time and money.  The view of the strip is cool from a helicopter and you can really see how amazing some of the hotels are from that high up, the only thing that would have made it better is if the tour I took was at night instead of the afternoon.

The crew was friendly, the ride was amazing and I'd definitely do it again, a very unique way to see Vegas.",2
7506,2,1547769600000,"Food was decent, but nothing life-changing. Yes, I know it's supposed to be ""simple French bistro food"" and it was ok but...

Just because Thomas Keller got a lot of money to slap his name on it, you are not really eating at a Thomas Keller resto unless it's French Laundry or Per Se. This is just a very slightly higher-end La Madeleine with inflated Strip hotel prices. 

I gave it two stars because of the noise and flaky service. For food alone I'd easily give three maybe four. It's a cavernous space and they really try to pack 'em in and flip the tables as quickly as possible to generate volume, pretty much the antithesis of a what a genuine, relaxed bistro experience in France is like. The noise level was almost deafening. My dining companion was seated right across from me and we were literally shouting at each other during several points in the meal. A conversation was pretty much impossible and neither of us are hearing-impaired. Although my ears were ringing all that night after...this is absolutely not the place for a relaxed and intimate dinner. Don't be fooled into thinking that just because it's ""French"" food.

Courses came out at odd intervals and aside from when it was time for us to pay and run out (flip those tables!) our server just didn't seem to be very good at his job. Maybe he was having an off day, got caught in the weeds...but I honestly think in his case he's just a bad waiter. 

Started with a nice platter of oysters. They didn't make us sick so that's good. Not that I expected them to. 

My dining companion had the roast chicken which really was delicious and so well done. Chicken is usually one of the most boring things to order on any restaurant menu but this is an exception. If you've always wanted to try one of those flavorful, moist classic French roast chickens you've heard are so good, here is a place to start. My trout almandine was quality. Simply prepared and I liked it. The rhubarb cake dessert was tasty.

This was my first visit back to Bouchon after I had gone several times a few years ago. Prior to that it was always for breakfast and lunch. It's was less crowded and quieter at those times. However, service there has never been especially good and it suffers the endemic Strip celeb chef phoning it in for the tourists problem. 

I'd recommend going for lunch or breakfast (especially during the week if you can swing it) avoiding weekend dinner there and not setting your expectations for food and certainly not for service, all that high.",2
7507,1,1547856000000,"Decided to stop here to satisfy a major craving for traditional ramen. The favorable reviews led us blindly to try this little place out. Forewarning: there is a bit of a language barrier, so if you aren't versed in Japanese be prepared to immerse yourself! The menu is limited, but fairly priced. All the ramen has a pork belly broth, so vegans and strict vegetarians may not find something here. I tried asking if there was actual meat in a particular dish, but I'm not sure our waitress understood my question as I did end up with two pieces of pork I gladly gave up to my carnivorous boyfriend. I chose the tonkatsu ramen with the black fungus. Sounds freaky, but really has a warm umami flavor reminiscent of chicken and dumplings! It was good, but not to die for. Filling, but not overly rich. Pretty much right in the middle without disappointing. For dessert we shared a yuzu cheesecake with matcha filling that was over all to quickly. I could eat about a hundred of those, easy. Overall, fair experience with good flavor that makes you feel as if you're in a coastal contemporary haunt in Japan.",2

I read a lot of reviews and maybe that affected me but many people were right. You're in and out fast. The food comes super quick so there's no time to digest, enjoy and spend some time. I guess they want you out fast. It's their loss tho because I think people would drink more if lingering were encouraged. 
Sooooo the food: 
I loved the tuna tacos and the burger. 
It was silly to order oysters. They were meh and we can get them at home. My partner loved the ravioli. The green beans were pretty good too. Our neighbours at the next table had enviable and gorgeous onion rings. For some reason they didn't like the mushroom salad and the staff were gracious and removed it and didn't charge them. 
Our server kind of ruined the mood. She was kind of snooty about the wine. In fairness she let us return a bottle we didn't like but she wasn't warm and friendly. Quite the opposite. For me I love to chat w the server and those interactions really influence the experience. She did nothing to enhance our experience. Quite the opposite. And I felt other tables got better attention. 
I would maybe go back but it's in the cosmopolitan which offers lots and lots of choice so I'd probably try another restaurant there first.",2

The wait wasn't long and the workers were nice. The only problem I had was that the boba tasted weird. It had a weird aftertaste that a boba should not and it was a little hard and not that chewy like how a boba should be. If I do go again I will definitely substitute the boba out for crystal boba.",2

This place is amazing.  They have many diverse spaces for both large and small groups.  The spaces can include technology connections when requested.

Our group had a conference room that seated about 20 people comfortably.  The conference room had an awesome vibe that helped produced a very productive planning session.  Everyone was able to see and hear everything. Getting to our room was very easy thanks to the clear signage placed ahead of time by the people at Switch.

It's great to see companies like Switch investing in Nevada.  If you didn't figure it out, their slogan is that they take ""no"" out of innovation and replace with with ""nev"" for Nevada.  They have a big sign with this on it, which is great, because I just thought they misspelled the word. :)",2

My only complaint is the service I received two weeks ago.  The waiter was very slow and there were only a few people eating in.  It seemed the amount of take outs that were being prepared were holding up the dishes coming to our table.

The ribeye was really good. Grill to exact request it was smooth and full of flavor. The Ceasar wasn't that great. When we ordered ours without anchovies it came with it anyway. What threw me a bit was the total lack of craft beer selection. Several pages of fantastic wines but no draft craft beer selection. Only bottles and sub par beer selection at that. Basically not the type of beer you want to complement a five star steak with. A little shocked actually. So one star for not what we ordered and one star for no craft beer.,2

As far as I'm concerned, the Beach Club is the world's greatest sandwich. There's nothing wrong with it, they make it on the quick, and all the ingredients are top-notch and really, really, really good. They're so good that they make you question the quality of the sandwiches you get in other establishments, so you get spoiled. 

I only ever get the Beach Club because I think it's perfect, though I've gone with other people who have ordered other options, as well. Nobody has ever complained about anything, and all the reviews I've gotten have been pretty dang good! The only consistent ""I just wish..."" comment about this place is that it's small inside. 10 people in here and this place is jammed and you'll have to ""excuse me, pardon me"" your way across the place. Not really a negative at all, but just so you know. 

On my last trip here, I ordered 3 sandwiches and some drinks and stuff. I walked out spending $25, which is a great deal for the food you're getting. It's like fast food in terms that you get it quickly, but not fast food in terms of quality. This place is full of win.",2

I wanted to take her somewhere fancy, and she is a Keller wanna-be-groupie (ain't easy getting into Fr. Laundry). Being poor, we went with the breakfast. It was resonably priced, quite good, and pleasantly informal.

Nothing leaps off the menu as ""holy crap that sounds great!"" It's just simple things done really well. Perusing the menu allowed several fills of the bottomless superb coffee. I ordered quiche, which was spectacular. The filling was essentially custard, that gave way to an extra-tasty egg/spinach layer, and a structured but yielding crust. The crust edge was just on crispy edge towards burnt. I've always thought of quiche as dough with egg and veggie scraps thrown in, but this was a masterpiece of the form.

When you take the mudane and make a subtle masterpiece, that's impressive. Kudos. Only four stars because my GF got the oeufs au gratin, and it was in the pedestrian realm. Alas.

The bistro itself is elegant but unpretentious, and the patio to the bizarre 10th floor pool lobby is a fine environment. Strangely, the prices were included on both menus. Service was excellent.",1

There were a few girls up front that looked genuinely sad to be there, and the owner (I presume) would come out and ask who had what occasionally. All that wait, and we got bowls that were about 75% rice. The actual teriyaki sauce is tasty with the chicken, but you get so little of the meat that it's just not worth it.

Mind, you before this, I was playing at the poker table. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 drinks...6?  I don't know how much.  I had to pass out at the house for a while, and when I woke up I was still drunk!  TIME TO GO PARTYING!

It is my last night in Vegas, fourth day of vacation and I haven't been to the gay club yet! ABSURD!  I was stuck with all these straight, moke men and it was time for this type of atmosphere to end.  Prior to this, Yelp led my two angels and myself, to  Piranha due to alleged good reviews.  The place was sooo sketch...., Even the woman who was about to take our money.... she had crossed eyes with a BMI of 30 something and a latino accent.  $20!  $20!!! Woman...you are OUT OF YOUR MIND!  We took our high-class diva-selves to Krave!  Our instincts didn't fail us!

Philamer:  You better screw someone while we are here (Krave).
Me: WHAT!?  Where would I go?  Take him to Jess' house?
Philamer: JUST DO IT IN THE BATHROOM!
Me: OMG!  Shut up already!  Let's just go and have fun!

Guy #1 with braces and a nice body: Um...what are you doing?  You don't know how to dance.  I kindly step away...

Philamer: What happened?
Me: He was a bad, bad dancer!
Philamer: You're being soo god damn picky! 
Me: :-P

Guy #2 I met through Philamer's friend.  My now buzzed state was well enough to know that this guy was  A TERRIBLE dancer! JUST TERRIBLE!  Are you sure you're gay?  Giving us a really bad name...
With no prospects, I attempted to make this better.  What's your name?  Bill?  Yikes...I can't handle this...NEXT!

Philamer and Jess were getting fed up and no body in plain sight. Until... yes!  Finally found someone who was dancing good!  YES!  I looked around and just starred ahead.  I think he was dancing with somebody, but I didn't care.  I had to interrupt!  Finding good dancers is such a rare thing now these days!  

Mr. Salad (keep his name private) is his nickname. This was a match made in heaven due to background information that was exchanged.  I even went as far to ask for a kiss.  At the end of the night, I had swollen lips.  We're keeping in touch to this day. YEA!

Philamer: sooo did you get some?
Me: Met a really cool guy
Philamer: Did you do it in the bathroom?
Me: Jesus....!

SYNOPSIS
This place is by the main strip and you can't miss it!  Like seriously.  When we looked outside there wasn't much of a line.  Perfect...because it was cold!  Inside is HUGGGEE!  Biggest club I have seen thus far.  They had gay dancers, performers, a fake Brittney Spears, midgets, people with GREAT bodies.  It's Vegas, the people you see here are from all kinds of races!  YES!  I don't know why this placed received poorer reviews compared to the ghetto we just visited.  Right night to come to Krave, I suspect.  I had a great time.  There were some songs I wondered why they were playing, but I burned a lot of calories. The price is kind of steep for my liking because I typically go to places that are free...but the night was definitely worth it.  Sometimes, you just have to MAKE YOUR FUN!

ENVIRONMENT
A big sign is outside in purple. KRAVE!  Once inside, it seemed like it was circus night.  YES!  This is the type of partying I should be bestowed upon.  Guys with great bodies, décor of the place was awesome, people on stilts.  The atmosphere screamed circus party!  At moments during the night, foam would come falling from the sky!  YES!  There were small pyramid-like steps you could go on and dance!  I used this to find people to dance with!  There were two areas, the dance floor and the area where 21+ were drinking.  18 and older weren't allowed. Nice! I love special treatments!

EMPLOYEES:
I never had a hassle with anyone here. The lady on the stilts, even though she was having a hard time moving, was nice enough to get out of my way to pass.  WOW!  Love you sistah!  

Some other reviews mentioned that some of the dancers were getting tired or weren't good. That is kind of true.  I was expecting them to get down and dirty!  But no, that wasn't happening.  Worse, they stuffed their pants to make their package bigger. LOL!  I laughed at this in entertainment instead of observing it with disgust.  

DRINKS
I needed to stop drinking by the time I was here.  Yea...I know if otherwise, I would have been making wrong decisions!!!!

PEOPLE
Plethora of people from different varieties.  Good dancers?  Um... to some various degrees.  Nothing I find heart-pumping.  I honestly just thought Ceazar was the best, probably because I danced with him the ENTIRE night. Giggles.

COST
I paid for Philamer and I, $40!  Whatever, I am on vacation!  Any other time, this would NOT have happened.... I think... I have to come back to Vegas to double check.

SIDE NOTE:
Under 21 are blatantly marked with black X's!!!!   Hahhaa..so poor thing.",2

I ordered the turkey wrap and the hubby ordered the 3 little pigs pizza and pork stew. After some wait, he brought out the wrap and pork stew, but said the chef burnt the pizza and it would be out ASAP. I ate one of the wrap rolls and didn't touch the rest. Wasn't the worst thing I've had, but it was lacking flavor. No ranch or cheese on it either as stated on the menu. After coming by 20 minutes after he originally brought the food, he never asked about my full plate or if there was anything else he could get in place of it. At this point, still no pizza. By the time he brought it, we were ready to go and asked for it to be boxed. Side note as well, we came in after 8pm, so it was not busy at all. When he brought the check, there was no comp or anything for the delayed pizza. Again, we really wanted it to work out and hate to be the stereotypical yelpers, but we feel the only way a place will succeed is with honest feedback. I hope Tavern Americana does well in the long run!",2
7726,3,1547596800000,"Worst place ever in charlotte. I order the sweet 18 roll, and 4 others... They were all not good. For some reason it was hard to finish the food, maybe it was the overload of msg in their sauces. I don't mind msg in food but when a restaurant puts too much in it gets hard to eat. The couple sitting near us had a really pissed look on their face, had three bites, paid and left. I should have taken a picture as proof but I was too angry with the food to think straight.",2
7739,3,1546387200000,"I received a flyer in my door one day that advertised 2 medium pizzas, any way that I like them, for $11.99. Sweet! I ordered my usuals but one with stuffed crust (no extra charge because of the coupon) & one regular. If I had to choose only one word to describe the pizzas, it would be: alright. I enjoyed the taste of the cheese but it was the type that's all in one piece so it's prone to doing the pizza landslide where everything falls off in one bite. 

The toppings were quality, and as Susan I. said, the ham is savory and delicious, unfortunately, the crusts didn't match up. I'm a sucker for stuffed crust from Pizza Hut where it has cheese oozing out and you can't see the other end, but this one clearly had a disappointing light at the end of it's tunnel. This crust also seemed to be thinner on the rest of the pizza so it got soggy before I even took my first bite. On the original crust, the center of the pizza was good but the crust was almost like a pizza from the freezer aisle. 

The people who worked there were really welcoming and their promotions are a great bargain if you're just looking for something to fill you up. 

P.S. There is now one table situated outside for those who want to dine in.",1

7752,3,1546905600000,"Absolutely love the place.

Stayed in a 1 bed room suite on the 15th floor with a gorgeous view overlooking the pool. 

The curtain opens automatically the first time we entered the room, revealing a floor to ceiling window. What a view. The curtain also double as a screen for the projector in the ceiling. Can use it to watch TV. The kids had a great time dancing in front of it while we put on music videos.

The suite has a full kitchen, electric stove top, microwave, toaster, blender, fridge with ice maker, a combined washer and dryer, dish washer, 4 sets of dish wares, assorted pots and pans, big counter/dinner table, a Jacuzzi tub in the bed room, separate shower and bathroom, big closet, and two pull out beds. After we settled, as a habit, we took the ice bucket and looking for the ice machine, and the maid told us it's only on the 5th floor. We went there and back, then it dawn on us that why there was so few ice machine, we already have an ice maker in our fridge!

The Jacuzzi was big enough for two and maybe even for three, thou it took a long time to fill up. Felt guilty to have done that in light of the drought situation in the South West region.

Beds are comfy and soft. The sectional sofa was very nice and spacious. 

The Hotel is connected with the Miracle Mile Mall from the lobby and shared a parking garage which is quite busy during the day and opens up somewhat in the evening hours. 

The pool is quite big and is 3 1/2 feet thru out. There are submerged lounge seats inside the pool for sunning which is very convenient.  

We really enjoyed our stay there.",2

Our favorite menu item is the Asian nachos: fried wontons with chicken, wasabi mayonnaise, and a sweet Thai sauce.  The salads are good and fresh, the burgers are tasty, and the fries are yummy. I don't drink beer, so I have no opinion on it, but despite not liking beer, I really like this place.",2

Wouldn't change a thing with that.

I got the onion rings as a side and they rank up there with the best onion rings I've had in the Valley or elsewhere. Breading was awesome and they were fried just right.

I dined for lunch and was surprised to find that they have an all you can eat option, which includes starters, regular AND signature rolls for $35--SCORE!! The best part about it was the quality of their sushi. They serve extremely fresh, flavorful and very presentable sushi, which is a big win in my book. I ordered the Tiger Roll, Girl on the Beach, and the Spicy Samurai. None of them disappointed! In fact, I alone, ate all but four pieces. I also received wonderful service, which added to my experience. The servers were super nice, friendly, and kept my glass full at all times.

7803,1,1546992000000,"This review is specifically regarding the Pharmacy and it's staff.

I recently had to travel to Las Vegas, for work, from out of state. During my trip, to LV, my chronic Diverticulitis decided to rear it's ugly head. By midday, I was in a considerable amount of pain. I called my G.I. Doc, back in my home state, to get a prescription sent over, for the usual antibiotics. Unfortunately, due to his medical license, he was unable to send the prescription, directly to an out of state pharmacy. He had the great idea, to send it to a Walgreens, near his office, then see if the LV location could transfer it. The LV Walgreens was indeed then able to transfer it, to their location, via their internal computer system.

I was in touch with Dave, in the LV pharmacy a few times by phone and he was just incredibly helpful. Very ""matter of fact"" and no-nonsense. My kind of guy, really. He never made me feel like I was making him go out of his way, or anything of the like. He was the one who initiated the transfer, told me when to head over, from the hotel, so I wouldn't get there after he closed for the night, etc.

After all this, the last thing I needed, was another problem, but... that was not to be, curse my luck. Unbeknownst to me, my most recent medical insurance card (which I DID have on me) DOES NOT have my prescription coverage information. (Separate card, now, apparently). Dave once again came to my rescue. He called my usual pharmacy, back home. Different company, completely. He was able to quickly get my current prescription coverage info, which they have on file. He then went over the meds with me, meticulously and made sure I understood all the ""do's and dont's"". I shook his hand and thanked him, profusely. He smiled and wished me all the best and his hopes that I started feeling better, soon. Just an all-around great man. Really and truly helped me out, with the rather difficult set of circumstances, he had to deal with.",2
7812,3,1546992000000,"The best place ever ! 
They are making the best wine in the world. Very tasty and it is REAL WINE with no sugar added.  Atmosphere there is really cool and people so nice . 
Highly recommended!",2
7813,3,1546905600000,"I came here because it was the most convenient place to go to and it was right next to the sportsbook. This isn't really a place you should go to if it's out of the way. The items don't come with sides, so you have to order it.

I ordered the triple decker sandwich which contained pastrami and brisket. The pastrami was decent, but the brisket killed the sandwich for me. 

The spicy fries weren't really that spicy. It just had a little cayenne pepper. Not really worth it.  You should order the garlic parmesan fries instead.",3
7815,1,1546473600000,"I like where the hotel is located as it's short drive from things like Taliesin West, the TPC Scottsdale Golf Course, the Waterfront, and Old Town; you have tons of restaurants within walking distance (Capital Grille to In 'n Burger or my first stop in Scottsdale, Oregano's at the corner of N. Scottsdale and Shea - short drive, don't walk that one) and plenty o' shopping including Kierland Commons, the high end open air mall, about a 1/2 mile away. A quick right out of the parking lot leads you to the 101 loop and all of the surrounding area.

The big blue Frank Lloyd Wright spire across the street is a great way to find your way home (the hotel is kinda hidden behind a Carraba's and an office building and easy to miss when driving). On weekends, go out to the pool around 9:00 PM and catch the fireworks from the Paradise resort behind you.

The hotel itself is clean with large rooms that contain a comfortable seating area, a decent sized desk for working, and a separate 2 seat table for meals. The swiveling flat screen is visible no matter where you plop down. There's no oven in the kitchen but who cares? When I'm traveling I am reheating not cooking meals. The microwave gets the job done. They'll shop for you if you make a list and the laundry's up on the second floor if you packed light and need clean clothes.

The staff is friendly and efficient. The little Marketplace in the lobby stocks pints of Haagen-Dazs and Milky Ways -- what else do you need?

A great place to stay whether it's a business trip or a mini-vaca with Honey Bunny and the Boy.",3

7835,3,1548720000000,"Genseng 3 offers great Korean food 24 hours a day.  While I realize they say they offer Japanese and Chinese cuisine I wouldn't bother wasting your time.  I say this because the majority of the menu is Korean, the waitstaff are Korean, and the cooks are all Korean.  

While there, my party and I had BBQ Pork, BBQ Beef, Kimchee, Kimbob, and steamed wontons. Everything was absolutely delicious and at the end we were incredibly full.  The waitstaff were all very nice/attentive, and our food was brought to us promptly.  The only reason I dock it a star is that for Korean food it is pretty expensive.  22 dollars for a plate of BBQ pork that costs 8 bucks in Korean places from New York, LA, and everywhere in between is pretty expensive.  That said, It's Vegas and one should expect when eating in any hotel you're going to pay a heavy mark up.  Either way, I will be eating here next time I head to Vegas.",2

7841,3,1547251200000,"I went to Nuit Social on a Thursday during their happy hour, and it was the stellar yelp reviews which motivated me to make a reservation. There were pros and cons to this place for me: 

Pros
- Their charcuterie boards. An absolute must. Most delicious cheeses and meats with accompanying compotes. There was on apple compote in particular that tasted fantastic with everything. So good!
- Service. Our server was so nice and attentive without being overbearing.
- The mussels. Unreal broth that we finished off with the table bread. Amazing, buttery  flavour! Probably up there with the best mussels I have ever had. 
- Decor/vibe. Loved the stained glass bar! 

Cons
-Online menu. I went anticipating to have the parmesan cheesecake because everyone raves about it, and it was on their online menu at the time. However, it's only a seasonal dish, and they haven't had it all summer. Our waitress told us that the haven't changed the menu online since June (this was a night in late August). In addition, the scallops were also on their online menu, and it wasn't on the menu when I arrived. Two dishes I had been looking forward to that they were not serving. *Also, some of the happy hour info on yelp isn't correct. It's half off the social plates ONLY per alcoholic drink you purchase. 
- Pork ribs and mac&cheese. The texture and cook on the ribs was excellent (falling off the bone) but they are extremely sweet; they had a maple syrup taste. The mac&cheese had a strong smokey flavour, overpoweringly so. If you're okay with very sweet ribs and smokey mac, then this is definitely the dish for you.
- The arancini was very underwhelming. Again, the cook on them was great. Great textures which fell apart so nicely when you cut through it, but the flavour was very bland. Needed salt, basil, oregano ... anything to give them flavour. The chipolte mayo it with was nice but again, you don't want to completely drench the arancini in sauce either. 

All in all, I would definitely come back here for the wine and the charcuterie boards. I still want to try this parmesan cake that everyone talks about, as well as one of their cocktails. I would definitely call in advance though  to double check if certain items are being served that night. Great service, and great ambiance.",1

7864,1,1548633600000,"Minus the fact that this place is always busy, and that there's always a line, it's definitely worth the wait. Some people stray from this place because it's not AYCE kbbq like everywhere else is. But the quality of their meats is sooooooo much more worth it than other places. I originally came to this place to try the spicy cold noodle which is by far the best I've had in Vegas. I normally get combo #3 just because it's a variety of beef. Their hot sauce is amazing and really spicy. If extreme spice isn't your thing, then it's definitely not for you. Nana is definitely helpful and funny. When we first visited she explained to us the menu and she also showed us how to eat kbbq properly. I'm always laughing at her because she seems so intense when she's cooking the food for you but she got jokes. The chemistry of the team working here is amazing considering they rotate and nothing is ever wanted without immediate attention. Just make sure you come here ready to wait as I've never been here when it's not busy. Other than that, enjoy the food, enjoy the vibe, and enjoy the food coma.",2

Elle était bonne sans rien de plus, ni de moins. Les betteraves n'étaient pas hyper grillées et auraient eu besoin de quelques minutes de cuissons d'extra pour être vraiment bonnes. Le fromage de chèvre est très bon plus la laitue (romaine) était aussi bien fraîche et parfaitement assaisonnée d'une vinaigrette simple sans en être détrempée. Les noix de Grenoble ajoutaient un petit croquant mais elles ne goûtaient pas grand chose. Pour ce qui est de l'ambiance, ça me fait un peu penser aux chaînes à café de style Van Houtte ou bien Presse Café, alors ça ne sort pas vraiment de l'ordinaire, mais c'est quand même bien.",2

7882,1,1547424000000,"The pizza is absolutely, authentic Italian. A real pizza pie. The taste brings you back to Italy, if you've had the chance to grab a slice across the pond. They serve white and red [meaning:with and without sauce versions]. I haven't been to the original in lil' Italy, so I cannot compare. I was impressed to learn that that they imported the pizza oven directly from Italy, piece by piece in containers. I'm definitely jealous of my friends and colleagues who live in the burbs of Laval and get to order a delicious piece of Europe whenever they have a taste for pizza! The pizza is 4.5/5!

On the other hand: The gnocci was soggy and was already falling apart in the bowl. The Panozzo was weak also, with little filling inside, and instead of the advertised prociutto, they put Italian ham. So it was glorified crusty bread that was not very satisfying- not to mention overly burnt around the edges. The tiramisu dessert was fresh and authentic when it came to flavour, but I wasn't a fan of the presentation; three clumps of it, arranged in a triangle? The chocolate torta caprese with a glass of prosecco is an excellent way to finish your meal, as well. The wine selection is great, providing good: by-the-glass, demi-boteille and full bottle selections.

The atmosphere is modern, fun and conviviale. The service was good, but slightly dry with our waiter. Example: he plopped the pizza on our table and quickly scammered away. Meanwhile other waiters are cutting the pizza for the customers around us- not too sharp, this one. Interestingly, the second time I visited- we were served by the same waiter and the pizza came precut-nice!

I look forward to ordering the pizza ""to go"", anytime I'm remotely close to boul. St. Martin in Laval. It's worth every penny.",2

The beer is always cold and the TVs are always on, and the food is pretty good too. I love coming here for football because they always have drink and food specials. My only gripe is that service is slow since they typically only have 1 bartender, 2 waitresses and a bar back on a typical day I've been here, even on Sunday afternoons when it gets busy! I love Yvette, the bartender who is usually there on Sundays (especially because she's a Cowboys fan too) but being the only bartender on a busy day makes my drink and food orders take a long long time. Another downside is that since it's a gaming bar, people smoke all day at the bar and it makes it a little uncomfortable sometimes when everyone around you is smoking nonstop. If you come here on Mondays for football, they host raffles and giveaways.",3
7887,2,1548201600000,"About a year ago, Bloor and Lansdowne saw the closing of its neighbourhood institution: The Dale. The Dale had been serving 'greasy spoon' diner food in the neighbourhood for nearly 60 years, but what emerged from behind the brown paper and dressing screens of a renovation was so much better.

The Bloordale Pantry, opened by young couple Rose and Anthony, has moved this venue from institution to gem. A lot of love went into this place; and not only love for their little diner, but also love for the neighbourhood in which it sits.

Upon entering, the greeting was warm and friendly, which wouldn't be strange as my guest and I have eaten there a couple of times, but you don't need to be a regular to feel at home; every one of their guests seems to be rewarded with a warm smile and happy hello.

The room is decorated with local art mixed with diner kitsch. It's all brought together by red vinyl booths lining one wall, and an old dinerstyle counter and stools lining the other.

The menu's main theme is diner food with an all day breakfast and lots of sandwiches, but it's all updated regularly and prepared well. It also features a lot of Italian fare with both a panini and pasta section.

On a recent visit, my guest tried the 'Mac'n'Cheese', which she thought was cheesy and good, albeit needing a little more flavour. My Bloordale Brisket sandwich was sloppy and well cooked--as it should be! The brisket meat was tender, but not falling apart. The barbeque sauce was a little sweeter than I generally like, but overall the sandwich was filling and comforting just like diner food is supposed to be. Served with their expertly seasoned and perfectly crisp French fries and creamy coleslaw, it was quite a large portion.

Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and with a menu that has vegetarian options and interesting daily specials, like meatloaf, 'Jalapeno Popper' burger or house cured trout, The Bloordale Pantry pretty much offers something for everyone.",2

As far as what I had, I started with the chopped salad. Delish! For dinner I got the petite filet special. This was different than the regular petite filet, because it came with the most delicious king crab leg meat as well in a yummy butter sauce. I honestly could only eat half of the steak, this was just too much food all around. 

For sides, we got the mushrooms, creamed corn, creamed spinach, sweet potato fries, and scalloped potatoes. holy bananas these were all so good.

Then we finished with the butter cake!! Which is gigantic, way to big for two people. We all got some of it (there were six of us), but keep in mind we were stuffed at this point! The noise level was reasonable in this restaurant, so it was perfect for a dinner with colleagues.",2

There is a bar that serves excellent mojitos, but it doesn't have that kinda sleazy Casino feel.   We stayed here for my nieces' basketball tournament and got two suites.  I switched off on both the sofa bed (comfy after you put that cushion on) and the bed - super comfy.  Gym is really nice - spin bikes, treadmills and good weight machines.  Parking was also free, but the traffic around the hotel was pretty horrendous. It took us 30 mins to get from Aria to the lot (which is less than a mile away).

The only reason I am giving it 3 stars versus 4 or 5 is because the day we were supposed to check out (11am) and we were in a rush to get to the last game and started loading the car.  We had to do two trips and when we went back to the room (it was 9:20, game was at 10 am), the key wouldn't work.  Housekeeping was cleaning another room and I asked if she could let us in our room as we were in a rush.  She said that she wasn't allowed to do it so I asked if I could use the phone to call the front desk.  They said that we were shown as checked out and said they would send someone up to let us in.  We saw a staff/security guy walking toward us and we thought he was sent to let us in but he said that he also couldn't let us in.  So he called down to the front desk again and instead of asking if he could let us in, he confirmed that someone was coming up.  My brother in law was frustrated because we were late to the game and ran down to get another key.   He had never checked us out and was upset because they locked us out for no reason and the staff wasn't very helpful. I understand they could get fired but the security guy should have asked for permission to let us in instead of just confirming someone was coming.  So overall a great stay until the end.",2

7918,2,1547683200000,"If you are in search of a park for your kids to play in with playground equipment...this isn't your place. BUT, if you're looking for a peaceful sit down with a dozen of donuts from some donut shop in downtown...lol...then you've found it. It's not a big park. However, it's a nice park to watch your kids frolic around. Layout a small blanket or sit at a bench and just chill. Like, literally just chill. It's nice to have a spot in the valley where you feel you can do that. I love everything about Symphony Park and I love that it sits next to The Smith Center because it creates this not-so-in-Las-Vegas vibe. 

Grab your kids, fave book, some lunch or snacks, and roll on over if you just want some chill time. It isn't a busy park. Everything we have gone we have either been the only ones there or by the time we leave a couple people roll on. Side street parking available. Oh, and don't expect a bathroom as there isn't any.

Enjoy!",1

I am very happy with Chef Fei and his precision on maintaining consistency and remembering individuals previous orders. Mirugai, uni, toro, amaebi, ikura, and sake are a few of my favorites! As well as the Jessi roll which isn't on the menu but full of Asian pickled vegetables, very refreshing, a bit salty but if you like ume, shiso, gobo, and cucumber... Try it!! :)

First I got in a shuttle and went from the mall to the airport. The driver on the shuttle was speeding the entire time. At the airport I waited for the big bus, but when it came the driver decided to go to lunch. 
-  minus 30 mins
After that he personally loaded on everyone's luggage rather haphazardly (don't pack anything breakable) and checked everyone's ID with all the speed and style of an immigration official in a corrupt third world country. Then we went to another gate and repeated the process.

7990,3,1546732800000,"I don't see what the hype is about. My family and I see tons of commercials for CiCi's Pizza in California but when we go to look up the nearest one, Nevada is the first location that pops up. 

That weekend we happened to be in Las Vegas so we decided to check it out. 

Food: If you didn't know, CiCi's is an all you can eat pizza buffet. The pizza selections are basic. Your classic pepperoni, cheese, combo and then they have specialty pizza. Mac and cheese pizza, sausage, pineapple only, and so forth. BUT there is only about 7 different pizzas at a time. They have soups which are not that good. A basic salad bar and sweets such as cinnamon pizza not as good as Woodstock's and brownie pizza also not that great.

Ambiance: It feels like your normal pizza joint. In comparison to Round Table or Mountain Mike's. There was a small arcade at the location we went too, nothing crazy.

Service: This is why I gave this place 3 stars instead of just 1. The cashier was a nice woman, she had to deal with a large birthday party and all the customers coming in and out. The cleaner, who was African American, he was phenomenal. I wish I got his name because he deserves most of the credit. Always making sure the tables were cleaning, collecting dishes and this is what made my day. He would always ask you, ""how was your meal? Did you enjoy your time here? Is there anything we could do to help you?"" He had a smile that could light up the room and a positive attitude. 

Other than the amazing service, I wouldn't come here again to be honest. Not the best pizza around, way over hyped!",2

8006,2,1548720000000,"I was excited that (yet) another restaurant opened in this location. It's convenient and a beautiful spot, yet it seems to have an invisible revolving door, so you never know what will be there from month to month (or so it seems). 

Since West Addison is so new, I have to give a lot of leniency for working out the kinks. It's inevitable and forgivable. That being said, I promise to return and give them a second shot down the road... if they are still open.

I agree with most of the kid-related comments below. What are you? Bar or family restaurant? Even if you are a family restaurant, come on people, wrangle your offspring. Our generation was not brought up that way. If we were lucky enough to be taken out to eat, we were expected to behave properly. So true, Nick S., this is not Chuck E Cheese. 

But I digress. As of this writing, the restaurant is just OK. The food was fine. The wine was over-priced, tiny pours (though I do like the stemless glasses), and the waitress had zero ZERO! personality. We observed some of the other servers around us and they all were personable, friendly, helpful... we were jealous. Ours sucked. I don't remember her name but she had short blonde hair and never smiled once. Not once.  

The environment is super loud. Perhaps because of the low-ceiling area in the back, where we sat. (Up front has high, vaulted ceilings.) Perhaps because of the drunken cougars at the next table. Or because of the maniacal children running around, screaming. Hard to say. If I give this place another shot, I'll bring a jacket (it was chilly that night) and sit on the patio. Less rugrats, cooler, quieter. And the nice waitress was working the patio!",2

Despite being only 1 topping it was tasty and enough to fill me up!

Their crust is super light and buttery.  You can hear that nice crunching sound with every bite.  I'll have to come back and try more of their pizzas.

He didn't want to be there any longer. He almost told the guy doing it to hurry up because it was taking sooo long. I understand they do an amazing job, and it takes time....but over an hour for a simple hair cut, not even a beard trim is a little much.

I started out with a margarita - which came in an awesome shaker. It was pretty good, but I've noticed that margaritas out east are A LOT sweeter than margaritas in SoCal. If I want a perfect margarita ... I'm going to have to make it myself - at home. 

Instead of getting entrees, my mom and I ordered multiple appetizers. We got the mini taco plate with fish and shrimp, sweet corn tamales, the sope with vegetarian toppings, and rice/beans. The tacos were amazing - especially the fish. The sweet corn tamales cakes were just okay, not bad - but definitely not good. I've had tamales before and sweet corn tamale cakes - and they have never had cinnamon like these did. Just not good ... If you want really good sweet corn tamale cakes, go to Cheesecake Factory (do they have those out here?). The sope was good, but a little crunchy on the bottom - not sure if that's how they are supposed to be, but I've never had them like that before. The rice and black beans were good also. 

All and all, I will definitely go back - and I will have the fish tacos again! I will try their enchiladas one of these days.",2

I used to order from Venezias more frequently but they are more expensive so I will be ordering more often Rino D's in the future.",2
8044,2,1547424000000,"All three stars go to the food and none to the service. I ordered the (vegetarian) salad I referred to in my previous review and what do they bring me? A caesar salad with salmon on top. They took it back and brought me a non-animal salad. I actually didn't know it was Caesar at first, I just thought wow they really have changed this salad since I last had it. But I started to really wonder where my beets and butternut squash were. I just thought they really gypped me with the toppings. I soon found out that my husband ordered a Caesar salad with salmon but he thought it didn't taste like Caesar and there were a lot more non-Caesar-like things in there, like quinoa and goat cheese and farrow. That's where MY salad went all along! But it had salmon all over it so what could I do at that point but be totally depressed with a weak and boring and very mediocre Caesar salad. So maybe my three stars should be two. But the roasted peppers in oil and salt are just so awesome. 

If we had ONE waitress/waiter and not FIVE, it might have gone better for us. And maybe they could like, I don't know, use a notepad to write down the order so they really can get it right? 

Also I think the dress code is very slack for the waitstaff. One of them looked like he was trying to be homeless. 

They covered up that tree hazard though!!! Enough people must have gotten hurt there. They also have an actual business sign out front now. And a parking lot next door! Still no place to wait but luckily we got seated quickly.",2

It was quite refreshing to see pan seared calamari instead of deep fried. The sauce that the calamari was soaked in tasted phenomenal with some garlic bread!

Went there got them changed and left. Once I went on the highway it was vibrating at 110km/hr. Brought it back to him the next day and balance it again. Second time I went on the highway it was vibrating again! So went back there and balance it again. Third time went in the highway it vibrating again!!! I called him and said you got to be kidding??? 

He didn't know I was a mechanic before and I told him there is a tire defect. This guy is trying to tell me the tire is cheap and really can't do much. I told him this is new and its warranty ! He told me to bring it back again so I did. I thought he didn't have the hunter machine to do road force balance there for he won't know which tire is defected. 
Next day I brought the van back and he test drive and took the front tire off and balanced it. That's when I realized he did had the hunter machine to road force it because he left the door open this time. When he was done he didn't even put the wheel cap back on. This time is finally balances!!!

We ended up cheating and turning one of our computers into a secure hot spot for the rest of our gadgets.  Trip to Wal-Mart and the purchase of a cheapy ice-chest replaced the $13 a day refrigerator charge.  It also held more than the fridge they offered. The 12 pack of soda purchased for $3.50 at Wal-Mart replaced the $4 a bottle of Pepsi charge downstairs.  

Mold in the bathroom pretty bad.  If you are 6' 6"", you will have to bend to even stand in the tub due to the low ceiling clearance.  At 6'2"", I still ended up getting shampoo on the ceiling.  Bathroom sink very low..  Ceiling in hotel hallways very low also, and waves and tears in hallway carpet easy to trip over. Elevators pretty fast, which was nice.

Supposed clogged drain somewhere that was going to flood the hotel by morning woke us up at 3 am when maintenance started fishing the pipe somewhere in the building.  It took them 1/2 hour to resolve that issue, and only another hour for me to get back to sleep. Two more nights sleep were interrupted when the extremely loud announcement from our room's wall speaker notified us a few times that the cause of the alarm (that we didn't even hear) has been determined and there is no cause for alarm. I can only assume that it was a building wide announcement for something that happened in the casino.  On the 14th floor in the Habitat wing, noise from the adult only pool area sounds like loud haunted wailing.  

Had a full face waxing done in the spa.  Spa was totally empty at 10 in the morning.  Just me and two employees.  Once back in their waxing area, I was told that I had to pay an extra $20 to have my cheek area also waxed.  The ended up missing the side burn area all together, which ended up looking very funny once I noticed.  

All in all, this hotel SUCKS!  Over charging and then nickle and diming everywhere you look.  Customer service also sucks, though our housekeeper was nice and knew what room we were from.  If we ever come back to Las Vegas (which is very doubtful), we won't be staying here.",2

Randomly found this place when trying to find a place to get dinner. I couldn't have had a better welcome, getting served by the owner Orin. I wanted to try multiple meats but didn't want all the sides, and he recommended getting it by the pound instead. Saved me money and got me what I actually wanted.

Food was delicious. So delicious I took my family back the next night to try more of it. It was all amazing.

Orin is an awesome dude, and so is his staff. I found myself chatting with him about BBQ, past careers, whatever. He is doing a great job and I can't wait until he stays open even later so I can hit this place up more often when I'm in town. Get your butt here!",1

8148,3,1547942400000,"I wish I'd read the reviews of this store before becoming a victim too. My experience was similar to many of the other 1-star reviews here. I hope that by spending the time to write this review I'm able to save someone else the unneeded nightmare of dealing with such an unscrupulous and rude business. If you love your new baby and don't need stress added to your pregnancy, don't shop here!

On July 3, 2012, I was looking for a store selling the Origami stroller because I wanted to see it in person. I called USA Baby Child Space and the lady on the phone said that they had it in the store and said I could come in anytime. Within the hour I was at the store and when I couldn't find the stroller, I asked a salesperson where I could find it and was told they didn't keep it in stock. I told her that I'd just called and was told it was in the store, and the lady looked surprised and said, ""oh we just sold it."" I thought this was strange, but didn't know anything about the store at the time, so I believed her.

I ended up spending $3,600 including ordering the stroller sight-unseen. I also purchased a matching crib and dresser. The items were to be delivered ""in a couple of weeks."" I also paid an additional fee for delivery and for assembly.

On July 29, 2012 (not too late), they arrived at our home with the items. The stroller was fine, but when they brought the dresser in, my husband said that he noticed that it was bowing like it was made of rubber. When the delivery men left the room, I attempted to show my husband how the top of the dresser becomes a table by pulling out the top, but something wasn't right - it was sticking and crooked. My husband pointed out that one of the wheels was missing from the bottom corner of the dresser leg. 

Then I started to open the drawers. When I opened the top drawer, a screw fell to the floor with a ""clack"" on the wood floor. When I opened the second drawer, two more screws. When the delivery men came back in, we pointed this out to them. They opened the drawers and more screws fell, then on the last one, some splintered wood fell to the floor along with one of the metal guide rails. (We kept pictures of this.) 

We called the store and spoke with the manager ""Evelyn"" and explained the situation. She pressed REALLY hard to get us to keep the ""furniture"" until a replacement could be delivered. My husband said that the dresser was a hazard and we didn't want it on our property where a baby was going to be, so they took the dresser and crib back. I asked Evelyn when we would receive a replacement and she said she would call me the following Monday with an update because there was nothing she could do on a Saturday. 

On Monday (surprise!) no one called me back! I called them Tuesday and reached Evelyn who told she couldn't give me any information, to wait, and that she would ""call [me] tomorrow."" Nobody called me Wednesday. I called them Thursday around 4 but Evelyn was ""busy."" I told them that I would like to get my money back if they wouldn't provide me with an approximate date it would arrive. They told me that Evelyn would call me back on that. She called around 5.30 p.m and I asked what the status on the furniture was and why she didn't call when she promised. Evelyn started (literally) SCREAMING at me the whole conversation and if you can picture this, she literally screamed that dresser won't be here next week either, that she didn't know when it will arrive and that she wouldn't give me a date, but that the was ""working on it."" 

I told her that since she couldn't even provide an approximate delivery date and because I no longer had time to keep trying to track her down (or felt like being screamed at by a crazy person for that matter), I told her I couldn't wait and that I wanted a refund. 

She started screaming at me again saying they wouldn't give me my money back. I told her not to scream at me anymore since we have been good customers who spent over $3,500 at their store. She replied (again screaming) ""I'm not screaming at you. You don't understand you need to listen I already told you I'm working on it."" I appreciated the irony of her screaming that she wasn't screaming at me.  

When asked if I could speak to another manager or just someone who wouldn't scream at me the whole time Evelyn replied, ""I'm the highest person at the store and there are no other managers.""

I let Evelyn know that I would be disputing the dresser/crib portion of the charge because I spent a lot of money in this store on what I thought was quality new furniture for our baby girl, I was 6 months pregnant and very upset. What should have been a joy for our family ended up being a headache with a crazy person screaming at me.

Only after opening a chargeback with my credit card company for the dresser/crib portion of my order, did I IMMEDIATELY get a call from USA Baby saying that the items I was previously told would be impossible to get quickly were magically ready for delivery.",1

The cashier was a little confused but the barista seemed more knowledgable, although still gave me a cup filled to the top with water for the americano. They're using 49th parallel which is generally good but both coffees tasted over extracted and were served in paper cups.

8168,3,1546560000000,"So the fries are bomb! Reminds me of a burger joint I ventured to often living overseas. I wanna say Beastie Burgers in South Bank in Australia. They put rosemary on their fries. They were thick cut though. I like thick cut fries better... if you like the skinny fries then you'll like this joint. 

I had the Carolina Classic... which was decent. Dude at the restaurant told me that he put a fork in my bag because the burger can be pretty messy with the chili. Welp! Guess someone forgot to make it extra messy that night because the chili was perfectly contained... and he forgot the fork. 

My dude had some chicken burger. It wasn't memorable. 

I also had a chocolate cookies and cream shake. It was aight.

8192,1,1546300800000,"When you're a visitor you may not know more than the restaurants just outside your hotel.  This is where meeting the locals and asking their advice comes in handy.  Lucky for me, I went to Vegas to visit some long-time family friends who'd been in Nevada for over ten years.  Now, these are folks who are originally from Jersey, so their standards are New York style pizza.  Or, perhaps that's my standards and I just know they also like that style.  I thought the pizza was pretty good:  thin, soft crust with lots of sauce and cheese and flavor of course.  I had kind of wondered if there was a Vegas style pizza.  Turns out they told me the person who owns Kerry's is from the Jersey area.  Go figure!   Well, at least I think they said it was the owner.  It was someone who worked there.  Oh, and I also tried the garlic knots, onion rings and mini corn dogs.  They were all good.  Watch out, though, the garlic knots are addicting!

The atmosphere is a great place for bringing friends and eating good food and laughing and having a good time, especially if you're a sports fan - college in particular.  And that is what we were there doing.  My friends go there fairly frequently, so I'd say they're fans of Kerry's.  I had positive experiences the times they brought us there in that oh so short visit.",1
8195,1,1546992000000,Went on a very hot Friday around 3 pm.  My dog was the only dog in the park most of the time but that was just because of the time of day I think.  Nice and big grassy area with lots of benches around to sit and watch the dogs. I really liked that it had a little gravel path around since I don't really enjoy walking in grass.  It was very clean. I didn't see any poop and there was several baggie stations for clean up. The covered area with picnic tables was awesome since it was 100 degrees.

8242,1,1546473600000,"Well, last time I wrote something about xyz I said I hadn't had a bad meal yet, and that's still the case. As ever, our food yesterday was pretty good. But...I definitely can't say the same about the service. We started with a produce sticker in our drink, which frankly we were pretty cool about and drank anyway. When the waitress came back after 20 minutes to tell us ""our order was lost in translation"" (ie she forgot to put it in), we were cool about that too. When she did bring the food and it was wrong, we didn't say a thing as she ran back to the kitchen again to get the right order. When my girlfriend was finally getting ready to put the first bite in her mouth and the waitress showed up yet again to whisk her plate away because it was once more the wrong thing, we still didn't complain. And then we never saw her again. Empty drinks the whole time. Part of my order never arrived.  If you're counting that's 4 food errors, plus a foreign object, plus neglect.  So all in all, pretty bad service right? So when we say, verbatim, no anger or attitude ""so, that was pretty rough, is there anything you can do for us?"" what I'm expecting to hear is your first ""I'm sorry"" of the day.

8243,3,1547856000000,"My sister Irene V. set up an event for me to meet some people this past Wednesday and it was fantastic.  Although the restaurant doesn't normally accept reservations for the bar area they made an exception for us.  We had a robust group of 20 and the bar staff (specifically Heather)  made the experience extremely enjoyable.  Heather took the time to explain the oysters available for the day in great detail as well as recommend several items as this was my first visit.
  My oysters arrived promptly and was quickly joined by my beer.  Every time my glass was empty Heather seemed to materialize with a new beer.  ""Carlos, would you like another Alaskan?"".   -Yes Heather I would.  :)
   Food item of note was a pasta dish called ""gnocchi""  It was a small bowl full of heavenly goodness suggested by Irene V (as much as I hate to admit that).  Good lord.  Small pasta with a creamy filling sitting in a thick butter sauce that is without a doubt the best pasta dish I have had in years.
  The restaurant had a classy feel but mellow enough that I felt quite comfortable in khakis and a polo shirt.  There is a full bar with upscale alcohol and a knowledgable staff.  I thought the vespa raw oyster bar was a cute touch and the ladies in the group of course took a photo of them sitting there.",3
8246,2,1548547200000,"My wife and I went to Shamrock Burger last night for dinner, and I felt the need to write a review today.  This was our second trip to Shamrock, and both were enjoyable.

The place itself is bright and clean and fairly new and modern.  The staff were all quite friendly and helpful, and the cashier was very pleasant, explaining all of our options and choices.  She also pointed out that the burgers are now all homemade (I didn't know that they weren't before) which is nice.

Now, the food... I ordered the big 10oz burger because I was starving, and got an order of onion rings with it.  The burger patty was lightly seasoned, and did look hand made.  The big one (there are 3 choices... I think 4oz, 6oz, and 10oz, all of which can be ordered double-stacked) was a thick oval patty, which stuck two half moons out each side of the bun.  It was cooked well, and was juicy without being sloppy, and held together well.  The seasoning isn't my favourite, but it certainly wasn't bad at all (I can't say it reminded me of Lick's, but I haven't been there in a long time).  The cheese and toppings were what you'd expect - I ordered a pretty standard lettuce, tomato, ketchup, onion with cheese (+$0.79 I think) and loved my burger.  It was a monster, too.  10oz is a big burger, but it was really good so I had no problem stuffing the last few bites in.  Oh, good fresh bun, too.  No problems at all with mine holding together.

The onion rings were a standout for me.  A good amount of really tasty batter, fried puffy and crispy golden brown, there wasn't a single soggy, floppy ring in my batch.  They weren't all-onion either, which some places like to do, starting with massive double-thick onion chunks.  These were the right size that an onion ring should be, at least in my mind.  And the container is large too, none of this ""put an order of onion rings in a small fries container"" business that I see in lots of places.  It was a good sized portion, which is good because they were delicious.

My wife got the small burger, which she was very happy with, and an order of poutine, which she liked a lot the last time we were there.  It was a hit again this time, and I dipped in for a few bites despite feeling ready to burst.  The gravy is good, not the tasteless generic stuff you get sometimes, and the cheese curds are large and plentiful.  The fries themselves might be a small weakness for me, but only because they weren't anything special.  They were still decent, just not as standout as the rings, and those will always be my go-to side here.

I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, but in any case this is a great local burger joint for us, and I would rank them up there with the usual Toronto favourites like Apache.  It will probably come down to personal preference as to which one is your top burger, but Shamrock should at least be tried especially if you're in the east end of the city.",2

8281,3,1547164800000,"This review is about buying a new 2016 Versa Note. Our experience test driving is first oart. The buying is the second half of this review.

My wife's old 2003 VIBE finally started to have issues after 13 years and she wanted a similar style and sized car. So she test Drove a Versa Note. We knew going in that the one we wanted was not at this location but it was easier to test drive one here than make the hour plus drive and possibly not like it. 

Surprisingly for a 1.6L 4 cylinder it did very well. Our VIBE had a 2.2L my F250 a 6.7L Diesel so these are our comparison points. 

My wife drove it through town and absolutely loved the easy drivability, the suspension system that keeps you from feeling almost any acceleration, super tight turns, comfort and feel while driving. She could find no blind spots which was a big concern for her. I found 1 blind spot behind left shoulder I did not see a gray truck it matched the interior and was not in the mirror. It accelerates nicely up to 75 going uphill on the on ramp. I had to watch the speedometer to see the good acceleration because the way this is designed you cannot feel it. You can see it but not feel it. Found a few hills and steep inclines. Drives and accelerated well. Very tiny lag. Extremely comfortable seats. Many of the controls are in the steering wheel or easily accessible. My one complaint is location of cup holders. They are under the center console so no tall items. Also there is a set under the drivers seat arm rest making them unusable. Very poor locations.

Test drive was a 4.5 star test drive. 

Purchasing took over 4 and a half hours. My wife had already chosen her exterior and interior colors. No budging on that. Then there turns out to be 6 S types and each can have minor upgrades and gets a bit confusing. So I chose the SL it's the fully loaded full tech model. So with these 3 choices finally made it became a hunt to find them. Turns out there was only 3 made and all were in a Warehouse ordered by mistake. In LA California.  So we set out to buy one and have it shipped in. Finance manager got the numbers right and all was going well slow but well. 

At this point 5 star service and support by everyone.

You would think we were about done now that we are 2 hrs into it. A half hour wait for a finance guy to start our paperwork up and call us back. Once inside the process to purchase becomes a 2 star event. My truck was a 4 star quick done and gone by Ford. Not here. A 1 hour speel about warranty. Simply put the 36,000 mile is for defective parts only not wearing out early or just going bad. So pretty much covers nothing. So a secondary warranty that's a true bumper to bumper can be bought as a add on. It started out at $120 a month complete BS. I found through my phone in the office better deals. Finally got a 5 year bumper to bumper and a 2 year maintenance package for $40 a month. Never settle always argue them down. Then issues getting the VIN # slowed us down. And the paperwork started. Total time 2 and a half hours. Ford less than 20 minutes my total time at Ford with the test drive, financed,  signed and drove away was 1 hr 15 minutes. That's why 2 star here maybe 1 star even.

So we traded in and have no car. They gave us a loaner  to use until it arrives. That's pretty awsome I think. Our first loaner did get sold lol but things happen.

8284,1,1548028800000,"When this place first opened up the food and delivery was great.  However, I have noticed a decline in service and quality lately.  Tonight took the cake for me.  We ordered food at 6:30 and was given a 45-50 minute time frame for arrival.  Our food arrived at 8:10.  To top it off we weren't even given rice with our General Tso's.  We called the restaurant and the woman initially hung up on my husband.  When I called back she told me the phone lost service.  They offered credit towards a future purchase and I declined as we will not be ordering from here again.  Ultimately she gave me a $7.00 refund which is laughable, but whatever.

8301,2,1547769600000,"This place is just about worth the $30. For your very first time, you enter a username that you'll use every time after. You can input any driver name you want, so don't put something boring like ... your name. You can name yourself anything. I've seen ""Beatbyagirl"" and ""The Stig."" Nice. 

Before you hit the track, they make you watch a safety/ instructional video. It's very brief, don't worry. And then ...

Seven minutes of fury. The carts go pretty fast. I've heard they peak at 45 mph, but depending on the configuration of the track (they do change it up), you may or may not be able to hit 45. 

The speed of the carts is also governed by remote control just in case some one wipes out and the employees need to slow or stop the race. 

I really liked the printout they give you after your race. You're ranked against the other drivers in your race and against every other driver that's raced at any Pole Position location. After you've registered, every time you race, it keeps a tally of your score for every visit. It makes you want to keep trying to raise your overall score and improve your heat.

Sign up for their email notifications -- they are not in excess and being that the price of a regular is a little high, it helps to stay up to date on the specials. 

There are some people that go to PP that are no joke. They look down on people just wanting to have fun.  They are on a mission. And I get that.",3

The owner of this location is actually a very nice guy. (pretty sure the guy who is there 90% of the time I drop by is the owner). 

This location is near my office so I drop by every monday (Big Mary Mondays FTW). Love the food. Great customer service. 4 stars because of the nasty ""hot chicken sindwich"" on their menu. The big mary burger is great though.",1

Prices are really good and look for coupons as they frequently advertise and have specials.  We had a 40% off and met the price level, so were pleased.

I paid my first visit to Dr. Tran almost a year ago, and saw his deal on Yelp back when I didn't have insurance. You can see my old review, where he only charged me $40 bucks for a cleaning and X-Rays.

Yesterday, I was proud to come back to him and bring him my problematic mouth to fix again. I won't go into the gory details, but I knew I could trust him, and once again, he came through with his awesome professional care!

This office is great. Dr. Tran and the staff do a great job in making sure that you feel safe and painless, if you are getting a cleaning, or even getting things drilled. The digital X-rays are pretty cool because you can see close-ups of EVERYTHING.

The staff is very chatty! This is a MAJOR MAJOR strength and helps ease any anxiety you may have. You'll feel like you are hanging out with friends. And if you are lucky, you might even have the chance to pick the movie they are playing in the office. I chose the Tom Hanks classic, Big.

Yes, I am American, and in my short trip to Canada, I could never get used to the fact that Canadian bars are packed with people as young as eighteen.

Regardless, I took a look at this establishment from the sidewalk and thought, ""This is a bar??!!  No way!!""  I love how this little yellow house stands nonchalantly amidst the massive skyscrapers.

SIDE NOTE: This place is also the bar equivalent of my FAVOURITE cafe in Portland.  (See my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/rimsky-korsakoffee-house-portland#hrid:kMZBNKqWmvMKYA_JWd9vew)  If you are ever in Portland, I highly, highly recommend that you visit.

Unfortunately, my party made this wonderful place the last stop of the night, so I can't even remember what I had to drink.  All I can remember is that it was very large and Canadian...

I never wear my hair straight and decided to let her blow dry and straighten....and it was beautiful... but next day when I wore it as I would normally I was so disappointed.  I need to learn to communicate better I guess or find a picture to take with me.

They do self-serve yogurt working a 12 flavor rotation with 6 flavors daily.  If you're familiar with the froyo chain Yogurtland on the west coast, it's pretty similar.

When you go to Razzy Fresh it's definitely all about their toppings though.  Their yogurt isn't spectacular, but it's good enough.  Toppings include the usual suspects when it comes to fruit (strawberry, mango, kiwi) but they also have BLACKBERRIES!  They also have assorted cereals, various cookie crumbs, and chewy mochi.  I also like honey on my froyo, so next time I might ask the owner/suggest having a squeeze bottle of honey at the toppings bar as well.

They have a $5 minimum for credit cards, but because they do end up being on the pricier side for froyo @ $.41 per ounce, hitting that minimum is a piece of cake.

In a froyo saturated market Razzy Fresh might not stand out, but in pgh it's easily the place to be if you're in the mood for froyo.",2

Excellent restaurants (the Food Court has healthy options, too), exciting, trendy retailers offering myriad options (from sporting goods to couture clothing) and entertainment for the whole family. They have an excellent Kids Club program that is super-affordable and offers great programs for kids year-round, and plenty of comfortable places for Dads to lounge and catch up on email while their significant others shop 'til they drop.

I also got the green tea frapp once, it was pretty good! Although they do charge extra for boba, they give you a pretty big portion of it.

Oh, and they have those punchy cards, too. Buy ten drinks and get one free. Boba Tea House got rid of their's so I think I'll just go to ITwist from now on~

8432,1,1546905600000,"On a bride's wedding day, the salon should realize that the bride and her party is priority. After spending close to $700 at this salon, we were rushed through our day, my hair looked nothing like the photo I showed the woman (two photos actually - the first had a french braid around the bun which Jennifer, owner, could not accomplish even though it is a standard wedding updo), my sister has nailpolish all around her fingers like a child colouring outside of the lines, my mother had dark black eyebrows on her face that jennifer refused to alter after several requests, and my bridesmaid was told sternly by jennifer to stop talking while the makeup was being done.  Also, we were all supposed to leave by 11 30 the latest but 2 of my party were kept an extra hour because Jennifer overbooked, cutting my photography time in half and rushing those two to get ready. And that was only on the day...

Prior, I had my eyelash extensions put in, after which jennifer kept telling  me that she was adding extra and not charging me because I was the bride, and after getting extra done on my gel nails by Henry (who did an amazing job) because jennifer kept me waiting for over an hour to get my eyelashes filled because of overbooking, which resulted in me having to come back the next day (waste of gas and time) because other customers arrived for their appointments and I decided to give up my spot to avoid the angry customer from freaking out at the staff, she tried to charge me MORE money. I did not ask for diamonds on my nails. I did not ask to be waiting an extra 1 hour and then politely come another day to help out your schedule.

On top of that, even though I was informed by a worker I would receive 10% off for paying in cash and having such a large service, no discount was ever given even though I asked about this directly with Jennifer two times.

Honestly, Jennifer, you need to a) trust your staff to do their job and give price quotes according to your menu list. You should not be charging extra secretly, and you should not be making me feel like i'm getting a deal when you initially quoted me something else.

b) realize you cant do everything. If you don't have enough time, don't overbook and do a crappy job. If you can't commit to a wedding party of 6 women, don't accept my money.

Overall, this could have seriously ruined my day, and I'm beyond pissed to hear about this situation from one of my bridesmaids who kept it secret until today so as not to spoil the evening.

We got seated immediately at the sushi bar and within minutes we had our drinks and appetizers!

We both did AYCE which was $24.95 each for dinner. I think its something like $20.95 for lunch. Decent prices for the amount of options and rolls you have to choose from!

The dulce de leche and vanilla bean tasted similar and most like classic creme brûlée.

Honey Lavender was my favorite which surprised me. Smooth taste with a hint of lavender and honey. But the consistency was amazing.

Pandas Coconut was ok. It tasted like lucky charm cereal marshmallows. Not my favorite. 

London Fog had just too much of a tea taste. It was overwhelming.

This restaurant absolutely lives up to the reviews before me. Excellent atmosphere and fantastic food. We started with the homemade bread and burrata. Delish. Also ordered the cauliflower that everyone raved about -- and I can see why. It was seriously crack on a plate.  

For my main dish, I ordered the agnolotti with browned butter and summer corn. Every bite was a burst of flavors that I've never tasted before. 

Chef James was very active in the kitchen and made sure to interact with every guest. So personable and passionate. Cannot wait to make this a regular go-to place!!",2
8569,3,1548892800000,"Grand Ave Produce Company is a family owned business that has been in operation in Phoenix since 1946. When they first opened, GAP was an open air fruit market. I can actually remember trips to the stand on Grand Avenue (hence the name) as a child. Mom and dad would pile us all in to the car and we would fill up these enormous boxes with all kinds of goodness. I can still recall the smells as we would walk through the mountains of fruits and vegetables. They have since grown to one of the largest distributors of fresh fruit and produce in the metropolitan area, delivering to over 900 businesses statewide.

In order to maintain their role in the overall community and stay connected to their roots (pun intended), GAP offers a farmers market on the first Saturday of each month from 8:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.

Each market offers the freshest produce and fruit at incredibly low prices, based on the season and availability. It is literally possible to buy an entire trunkload of the yummiest things for under $30! Last year I literally had to eat fresh pineapple three times a day for a week because they had them for $1/peice. Yes, I got a little overzealous, but thanks to GAP, I now have pineapple growing in  my garden!!!

Anyway I digress...  GAP can be a little difficult to find the first time you go, so just head South on 33rd Ave to Lewis (just three blocks South of Thomas), then hang a left. Give them a call on the Friday before the first Saturday to make sure the market will be open or to ask if there is something special you are looking for and want to check on whether or not it will be available.",2
8580,3,1548720000000,"This place is very very decent. I would stay here again for sure, but I wouldn't be over the moon about it. 

Price: $200/night during the off season, at best
Amenities: standard
Access to the strip: very good

I came here because they let me stay three nights free on condition that I sit through their 2-hr pitch on timeshares. I would suggest this route. They will try to shame and bully you into a time share, but just stay strong. Then we got free entrance into Marc Savard's comedy hypnosis show (pretty good) and the Planet Hollywood Spice Buffet (never seen anything so terrible). 

The bartenders are cool. The pool is disappointing at 3ft deep, but there's nice places to sit if you're into that. 

Staff are courteous. The place is clean. It's not exotic, but it's a sweet contrast to the Econo Lodge. And it has direct access to Planet Hollywood's shopping center. This is not the Bellagio or Cosmopolitan. But you might as well stay here anyway.",2

I've had a few ok experiences with this place until I went the other day and had order eggrolls for the first time. The eggrolls had gone bad! It tasted rotten and it was terrible. 

The food isn't amazing! but for the price, it was worth going back to try again. Because they had 30% off for the first 2 months of grand opening, it was worth going even though the food wasn't great. But if I had to pay full price for this joint, let me just say that I won't go back.

The one thing I ordered that was actually pretty good was the rice. They use Jasmine rice for ther platters and you get a choice of pork, beef, or chicken, The egg that comes with the rice platter also known as ""com"" on the menu is really good! served with fish sauce. The drinks/dessert drinks there aren't great. Overall this place only scored 2 stars in my book. 

The service is terrible, but it depends on which server you get. There is 1 server who is really good and super attentive, but for the most part, every other time I've gone it's a different person and the service is terrible. Servers stand around and sitting down doing absolutely nothing, even when trying to get their attention.

The owner is a sweetheart, and bless her heart. But in order to make things work, she needs to hire servers who can drive the local back to see them again.",2
8598,3,1546992000000,"Right before I heard about the new beach club that will be taking over where Myst and Suede now are, I had finally checked out Spanish Fly, a bar and restaurant housed in one of my former old faves, Drift, that already brought a beachy feel to Old Town Scottsdale. I went there not expecting much in terms of food, since I had seen scantily clad crowds taking over the premises on weekend days that made it seem more like a spot to be seen than get decent grub.

But Spanish Fly has a pretty kick-arse happy hour menu, and their bean and cheese burritos rival my current faves, those of America's Taco Shop. And no, if you go there on a weekday night dressed in your business clothes right after work, you don't have to worry about not fitting in with a bikini-clad crowd -- bathing suits are only acceptable there on weekends during the day.

The bar looks like it should be connected to a hotel, with pebble floors and lots of lounge-y furniture surrounding the pool. Our bartender was friendly and laid-back, and the crowd was more diverse than the typical plastic you might expect from Old Town -- while most of the patrons were young, some seemed like they had just left work.

Spanish Fly's extensive happy hour is Monday-Friday from noon-8 p.m., making it a great place to day drink. The happy hour menu features half-off appetizers, party bowls and bottles, as well as two-for-one drinks. Their margaritas ($8-$10) were super-strong, so I thought it was definitely a great deal.

We tried the bean and cheese dip ($6 -- at happy hour, only $3) with chips, and it was a decently portioned serving of nachos that was heavier on the cheese than the beans. I also had a muy delicioso bean and cheese burrito (I ordered off the menu since the menu only features chicken fajita and carne asada burritos), and the burrito was huge and very filling and had the perfect balance of beans and cheese. I loved it!

While I enjoyed Drift for its tropical-inspired cocktails and decor, Spanish Fly didn't disappoint at all when it came to ambiance and food. I'd go back for lunch or happy hour or on a weekend when I want to be surrounded by beauties in a hotel-like pool without the room charge.",2

And she didn't tell me this till she was about to wash my hair! Then she tried to charge me 20$ for conditioner! Last time I checked that's part of washing my hair! After that she tried to get me to color my hair, highlight my hair, cut my hair, do my eyebrows and try to sell me product! I felt harassed! At the end I had a horrible cowlick and I looked like a poodle! It's not very hard to blow dry someone's hair straight!

8633,3,1548201600000,"My review is on The Mansion de Joel Robuchon (next door).

So anyway, I have one word to describe my experience: ORGASMIC.  

The restaurant interior is very classic parisian w/ touches of art deco.  The garden wall (18ft of corner to corner greens) is so beautiful and the ambience is elegant but not too stuffy.  The place taps into all the human senses perfectly. My only complaint was that it was too damn quiet in there.  Mind you, I'm a very  vocal person and so the place was just not conducive to demonstrating appropriate behavior given my experience at Joel Robuchon.  I think the good lord heard me call his name several times that night!

I had the 13-course tasting menu which sounded overwhelming but let 'tasting' be the operative word. Mushroom bisque, sea urchin, chilean seabass, tomato gelatin, kobe beef--it goes on and on--made w/ such craftsmanship and was ABSOLUTELY fabulous!!  The service was  exceptional, impeccable and in a class of its own.  

Pastries and dessert by renowned Chef Kamel Guechida was the finale of my wonderful experience.  Talk about having a ""multiple"".

This was the ultimate dining experience.",2

After 1.5 hrs in traffic getting to the old port through all closed roads all we wanted was a nice cold drink and a couple of appetizets. We went into Santos and were seated at a table. The water brought the menu and disappeared forever. After 15 min of waiting we finally saw a staff member and asked if we could order. He replied that he was just collecting dishes and couldn't take an order. I guess it didn't occur to him to call the waiter because after 5+ more minutes I went up to the bar to order drinks. The bartender was not busy, all his clients sitting at the bar were served and he was chatting with them. He told me he couldn't make me a drink because I was seated at the table and had to order from a waiter. I find it very poor managment when waiters are so busy that cannot attend clients in 20 mins while a bartender is not busy but not allowed to help.

There see no communication between managers here, And if there is well they just don't care! My husband had surgery and his disability checks got delayed so I had to be late this month. I spoke with one of the mangers on Thursday the 15th and told them I would pay in full on the 21st, basically i made a promise to pay. She showed concern for my situation and told me she will put a note on my account and she will look for the payment on the 21st. Well on the 20th I get a call from the facility, a different manager this time (i won't drop names) wondering where my payment was..... really?! Even professional debt collectors honor a promise to pay and won't call you until the day after the payment is due. Last month I was a little late as well just because the whole first of he month billing thing they do doesn't work for me with rent and other bills being due on the 1st, a week after my payment was made i get a call from the manager wondering where my payment was. REALLY?! Now I don't know if this is just aggressive collection tactics on the managers part or if public storage corporate, a world wide corporation is making them do it, but Do yourself a favor, go with a smaller self storage company if you need storage.  I used to work in self storage and Public Storage bought my facility and offered me a job. After learning how they operate.... i declined the offer and stayed with my employer at the time, StorageOne.  I should have known better before I rented at this location. Since December of 2015 I've had 3 increases in my rent and nothing but aggravation. trying to find a flat cart to move things around is nearly impossible.

I had the gourmet eggs benedict with mushrooms and it was amazing. I couldn't finish the plate because it was so big. We also tried the crepe with fruit and Nutella and English cream and it was delicious.

They also have great mimosas! And were willing to make a variation of the options on the menu. The decor was also bright and happy, the service was the friendliest I had anywhere in Montreal.

My biggest peeve was that my margarita was waaaay too sweet.  Another person in my group felt the same way.  We decided to say something since there was obviously something wrong.

8670,1,1548633600000,"I would highly recommend White's Integrity Auto. I had a terrible experience with another shop and White's restored my faith in the Auto repair field. They were not only very professional, but they earned their name by displaying a high level of integrity. They offer top flight service while making sure they are fair and treat each customer the way they clearly would expect a member of their own family to be treated. This is a shop I would feel comfortable letting my wife take her truck to and know they would not attempt to take advantage of her. More specifically they would tell her what honestly needs to be done and what does not need to be repaired, which was evident when the gentleman paying for his repair when I arrived to pick up my truck was told one of the parts he had been quoted as needed was not in need of replacement and that had saved him $120.00. That is a charge another shop with less integrity could have charged and that customer would have been none the wiser, but that is clearly not how White's and the owner Curt choose to do business. Not only is White's a top notch shop but they offer the most important thing a great shop should, trust. Finally I feel a great way to judge a shop is their facilities (the pride they have in their shop) and their personality. White's ""shop area"" is immaculate, you could literally have a picnic on the floor in their shop and Curt the owner was a joy to work with going as far as to come out to my vehicle and be silly with my young daughters who commented after we left that he was a ""cool dude"".

The dining room is very nicely decorated with a soft lighting that makes it very comfortable. The owner comes out to visit every table and makes sure you have enough water and to see how you like the food. Service is very, very good.

We only ordered three dishes so we can only rate the food on those. The Spicy Pork Spring Roll special had tender grilled pork however it was not at all spicy and the sweet dipping sauce was just too sweet without enough tartness.

The bun tit nuong cha goi (vermicelli noodles with garlic pork and crispy egg rolls) is basically the go to dish at an authentic Vietnamese place and this one hit on two and missed on two points - the meat was tender but did not have enough flavor or char notes and it was a small portion of meat as well. The second hit was the crispy egg rolls - very tasty and very crispy but there was no appropriate sauce for dipping. That was the second miss - the nuoc cham dipping sauce served with it - it was so watery! A good nuoc cham will be somewhat strong and have noticeable lime, garlic, fish sauce, sweetness and hot chili flavors in a well balanced mix. This one tasted a tiny bit sweet, with a hint of garlic and barely any lime or fish sauce notes - it was just too bland. The only offer sriracha and a hoisin like sauce on the table - no fried shallots, rushed red peppers or pepper oil as they do in Vietnam.

The only side veg they offer are green beans on garlic black bean sauce. These were really tasty with a nice coating of the sauce and topped with crispy fried shallots,

8762,3,1548720000000,"I had a steak dinner meet up with a lot of guys I grew up with. A few of them live around Westpark so this was the meeting grounds after the steaks. The service was great. The atmosphere was enjoyable, people were being extremely friendly, saying excuse me when they passed etc. Out of the strip of bars that make up the Westpark scene, this is by far my favorite. I did see a familiar face of the Cleveland cop who Ric Flair chopped my friend at Treehouse the one night. I doubt he remembered my friend though. Maybe I am just paranoid. Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me. I find it odd that no one really reviews Westpark bars. This could be a reality for a few different reasons that I think of.",2
8766,2,1546300800000,"A-mazing!!!! So absolutely delicious and tasty. I had the teryaki chicken and it was fresh, crispy and very flavorful. I went with a group of girls for Happy Hour and it was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I had while I was in Phoenix in July. Just delightful.",2
8771,2,1547856000000,"I don't really write reviews, but I just have to share the horrible experience I had at this hotel when I stayed this past weekend. I was excited for this weekend getaway to Vegas! Who ever isn't? Plus one of the girls found an awesome deal for this place on travelzoo for a one bedroom suite. The pictures looked super nice and modern so we booked our trip! I was happy when we arrived. The lobby was big and spacious. I liked how it wasn't as noisy and busy since they didn't have a casino. It kinda took a while to check-in since there were only three workers at the front desk. We were given the 51st floor and we were stoked!!! It had amazing views. I liked how you could take a tunnel to go to the casino and the food court. The room was nice and big. The decor was modern and I could not wait to get into the tub!! The lighting was dark in the room and there were some chips/scratches on the pull out table, but I didn't think much of it. The bed was big and comfy too. 

I was enjoying my stay until the next morning when I woke up with bed bug bites :/!!!! I've stayed at lower end hotels before and never had this problem. I was mortified. It was just a small patch on my arm so I didn't make a big deal out of it. I also noticed a wretched stench in the bathroom, but it was even stronger whenever I went to the sink to wash my hands. I brushed it off and blamed it on the bad ventilation. The girls and I decided to check out the SImon restaurant on the 6th floor where the pool also is for happy hour (it was a little chilly to go into the pool). The drinks at that place are spot on. The bartender had heavy hands, but that's good considering how much you were still paying per drink for happy hour. 

It all went downhill from here on out. We go back to the room to start getting ready for another night out. One of the girls asks for the hairdryer and we told her it's in a drawer in the bathroom since we used it the night before. She opened up the drawer and could not believe what she saw. She told us to go see what it is because she thought it was a joke, but it wasn't. There was a huge pile of POO in the drawer all over the hairdryer!!!!! Literally a pile of s***!!! Wth was going on??? Who did this?  No way were we too drunk to do this. Plus it was huuuuge!!! Way to big to come out a girl. No wonder the bathroom smelled like poop all day long. We immediately call security and the front desk and explain our findings. The first sign was that they didn't even sound shocked over the phone. They also took 20 minutes to finally come to our room to check it out. By then we already packed all our stuff up because there was no way we were gonna stay another night in that room. The manager and security at that shift came up, took our statement, took a few photos and told us we were going to be moved to a different room. There was no sympathy for what just happened. The only thing they offered to do was to call a bellhop to help move our stuff to the new room. Of course they said they were going to investigate to see if there was any unauthorized use of our room. We all had our key cards still so we didn't lose it, but you can't tell which room it goes with anyway. The whole process was taking forever and we had dinner reservations to go to. Security told us they would notify us in a few hours to update us on the status of the case. Did we ever get that call? Nope. We had to call ourselves the next morning before we checked out and of course the same guys who helped us out the night before weren't there so they couldn't really give us answers yet. The manager at the front desk wasn't any better. We had to wait another 15 minutes for her to come out and talk to us. She said someone from risk management would call us to let us know what is going on (any compensation). We told her that they had horrible customer service. Not once has anyone apologized for what happened to us. Someone broke into our room and violated our sense of safety. Luckily nothing was taken, but who knows what else this pervert could've done to our things.  We even asked if this kind of thing happens all the time, but of course they said no. The entire time they seemed so unprofessional and like they didn't care. What kind of customer service is that? If you may be in the wrong shouldn't you be trying to do everything they can to make up for what just happened? I guess the main thing was that it just seemed like they didn't care and this wasn't something small like the hot water didn't work in the room or something. Someone in that hotel crossed the line and our well being was jeopardized. 

So we go back home with a sour taste in our mouths because we don't know what happened. As of yet, we're still waiting to hear back from corporate. Guess they're just trying to think of ways to cover their butts.

Bottom line: DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL",2

8784,1,1547769600000,"Ate lunch at Rizzos last Wednesday (September 20,2017) with a friend. We both had received posts in early September (postings of September 6,2017) with raving reviews of authentic Italian food and a menu that looked promising. 
When we got there we were confused if we were at the right place as it said ""MICHAELS"" on the sign.  We had been told it was in the old Pork'N'More building which is where we were.  As we looked at the menus and our phones trying to decide if to stay or look for the right place, a waitress came over and we asked.  Michael's was the name of the last place the restaurant went by! 
We were given a paper menu that stated 'soft opening' and that didn't have much at all of the items on the menu that was shown on Facebook and they had prepared to give at the restaurant.  It was mostly sandwiches,  spaghetti and meatballs and antipasto or shrimp salad. And two desserts.
I got the calzone and my friend got the salad.  
I was still hopeful for a great meal but the calzone was unlike any I had ever had before.  I expected a lots of cheese, a rich tomato gravy. What I got was alfredo sauce with ham in a biscuit type crust with a side of tomato gravy dipping sauce. NASTY!!! My companions salad looked/smelled much better than my food. I also ordered cheese bread that was brought to the table after our main course was half way over.  We both got different desserts a lemon cake, and cheesecake with strawberries that were both good. The wait between eating and ordering was VERY long.  You definitely couldn't eat here if you only get a hour for lunch! And they were not busy! Our drinks were water and tea. We were told their bread machine they had been waiting on for weeks had not shown up and maybe the hurricane had slowed down its delivery...??? For a  $40.00 lunch I think I'll go somewhere else next time. I do hope they get it together. It would be nice to have a good restaurant nearby.",2

8789,3,1547337600000,"Nothing great about this place. They could replace the sign with Subway and I would never know...except that there would be fewer options to top my sub with. They coined the phrase ""Mike's Way"" in an effort to allow you to order your sandwich in some special and tasty way. In reality, it means lettuce, tomatoes, oil and vinegar...wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. As a vegetarian, this is one of my least favorite sub places since there are not too many toppings for those of us avoiding the meat selections.

I've only been here once and will not be going back.",2
8791,2,1548374400000,"A fast-food option that is at the very least healthier than the choices at the nearby golden arches, although probably more expensive. I had the 6oz corned beef sandwich ($10.45), which comes with half a pickle but no sides or drinks. You get your choice of bread, cheese (Swiss, smoked Gouda, cheddar), and mustard (hot or reg). Toppings include bell peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, or raw onions. The meat is taken out of a large steamer, sliced in front of you, weighted quickly, and packaged on the spot. Since the sandwich was under the hot-sandwich section, I expected it to stay warm for the 5 minutes it took for me to walk back. However, it was already cold when I unwrapped it again so I found that confusing. Is it false advertisement or am I understanding the word 'hot sandwich' incorrectly?

In all, not a bad sandwich even though it was cold. 6 oz was a lot of meat so I will probably get the 4 oz cheaper version if there is a next time.",2

8802,3,1546905600000,"CIndy C. has it down. My first time at Buca was lovely. It started off a bit awkward. When you arrive, it seems as though you've stumbled into through a back entrance.  The hostess ""desk"" is a floor mat, and I guess you're just supposed to wait to be greeted. That didn't really happen. We had to notify about 3 people that we were waiting to be seated before the hostess came and she wasnt very welcoming or friendly. I guess it was a busy night. 

After that however, it was a really great experience. I didn't know what to expect, and wondered if I had crashed a corporate party. ALL the patrons were dressed very well, and far from business casual...more like cocktail attire. 

As we waited for our table to be ready, we drank at the bar. I didn't drink alcohol that night, and when the bartender realized I was the only one in my party not drinking, he made me a homemade iced tea on the house. It was really refreshing. 

When we sat down, I have to admit, the tables were too close to each other' and the place was more so packed with employees walking around, crowding the floor. But the atmosphere is fabulous. The food is tasty and the great thing is that the menu is never more than (I think) two weeks old....if I remember what we were told. Its a great way to try new items on each visit. 

Its impressive and comfortable for the most part.",2
8811,2,1548892800000,"I visited the ""Aveda Montreal Lifestyle Salon Spa & Academy"" today and I was very pleased with the service. I find it very difficult to find a hair salon and let a stranger play with my hair, I often give them "" carte blanche"" because I can poorly imagine what would look good on my own face. Every so often we get disapointed with the result anyway, but thankfully our hair grows back !

Fortunately enough, Aveda delievered! I received a haircut by Angela for the cost of 45$. Starting off with a peppermint oil massage on a ""bed"" then shampoo. I have to say, Aveda's product always smell so delightful, it's most likely their most fantastic feature and my favorite part of the appointment.

I came in to reshape a short cut/bob haircut and change my bangs. The cut itself took roughly 45mins including drying. I'm overall very satisfied with the result. The salon was very busy but very clean.

The only negative thing that I would have to say about my visit is that as a customer, I expect the stylist/hairdresser to give ideas, brainstorm with me and let me know what would look best on me and I received none of that today. Also, the promo code which was available on Yelp app (15$ off) was not accepted as it only applies to Insitutes and not academies,

Would go back again.",1

I had been meaning to check out the new location for a while now and finally made it down there a little bit ago.

Wish I hadn't. The guy behind the bar was friendly enough and helpful, but aside from a couple of nice posters in the men's room, that was the highlight. The beer was thoroughly eh on tap. The two six packs we took home were both flat with the honey beer being almost undrinkable. The place was a mess.

The loupes are very clear and light weight and the light is small, bright, and light weight. I also like the touch on touch off function of the light and battery life seems longer than other companies. The price is very reasonable too and I'm glad I finally made the purchase.

If you're going to be a coach, you need to have a coaching attitude and you need to make corrections when needed. Especially when tumbling, where you can easily get hurt. The teachers are constantly checking their Apple watches and they walk away when they can see a child struggling. It gets very frustrating watching your child not get the help they need at almost every class they attend.

Not knowing the area, we walked up and down Danforth until we decided on the small plates at Mezes. We started with drinks: Skinos with lemonade for me and on the rocks for my husband. We've not had this before and found it delicious. Light and slightly herbal, it mixes nicely with lemonade. For dinner, my husband had the lamb chops and the tiger shrimp in a light wine and lemon sauce, served with vegetables. The shrimp was cooked perfectly. The lamb chops were done just right and served with a side of tzatziki. I had the Rodos Salad: mixed greens with figs, goat cheese, honey roasted walnuts drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette   It was awesome. We unfortunately left no room for dessert. I would highly recommend Mezes to anyone.",2

We had the pineapple upside down pancakes which had no upside downness at all! No brown sugar and no sauce! Just pancakes with pineapple in them. Boring!!! Then their bacon is blanched (pre-cooked) tasted like a dog treat. Other than that the breakfast was nothing better than what I can make in my own kitchen. Raise the bar Tryst Cafe, do something worth coming back for.",2
8839,3,1547856000000,"Above average punjabi vegetarian food. Service was good and courteous. As the restaurant is vegetarian so had limited selection but still did not miss any popular dishes. I ordered vegetarian biryani and thali ( platter with bread, rice, vegetables and sweet). Most of the restaurants have sweet and yogurt in thali but Rajdhani gives you only one to choose. The price of thali is same as most of the restaurants in Brampton ( $5.99 + Tax ). The place has seats where you can eat your food but not a full service restaurant. The food is not very spicy so my kids could eat it. If you are a fan of 'gajar ka halwa' ( carrot dessert ) then dont forget to add to your meal as they are really good in that. If you like punjabi food then also try their makki roti ( corn dough bread ) saag (spinach and mustard puree) with lassi ( yogurt drink ) on Tuesday's.

Today (I fail because I forgot to get her name.. she was at table 9) was another great day. My nail tech asked for a photo of what I was wanting (nude sparkle ombré) and recommended the color we use. She also made sure that I was okay with everything she did. She did one pink completely finished To make sure that I liked the finish product which I asked for more sparkly and she had no problem! 

She was very kind to ensure that I was getting what I like. Most of the time they just go at it and don't make a peep! It can be awkward! 

I live a good half an hour away and I still come here to get my nails done because it's worth the drive. 

I really do appreciate that if I've ever had a problem (not liking the colors or shape) they will re do it without hesitation.

8848,1,1547596800000,"We love dining here and after several years of dining every couple of months or so at L'Atelier next door, we recently switched to Joel Robuchon after a couple of incidences of 'not-so-great' service at L'Atelier.
(Although, we love  the trendy ambience & tapas-sized portions of wonderfully eclectic French fusion food there.....).

We always trust 3-Michelin star restaurants to be exceptional, and it's a shame to read some of the reviews on here - I am sure if you returned after telling them about your previous less-than-expected dining experience, they would absolutely make you leave happier!

The decor is very much to our liking - very European in taste - it's classy, luxurious & contemporary, yet somehow feels ""old school"" all at the same time...you will not be disappointed with the floral & table decor, absolutely stunning every season!

Always expect at least a 3 hour dinner at a 3-Michelin starred restaurant - you are paying a lot of money for such an experience - why rush?

The 'carts' are all fantastic - breads, cheese, desserts, tea - all beautifully presented & extensive - the dessert cart takes some beating!

We always have beautiful food here - never had enough appetite for 16 courses, unfortunately, but always enjoy the various A la Carte options.

Wine list pricing is as expected.  $100 corkage per bottle.
It would be very difficult to spend less than $1000/$1500 for 2 adults, if like us, you like to start with Champagne, enjoy a decent wine with dinner & opt for after dinner drinks with your cheese/dessert.

8916,2,1547424000000,"I should preface this by saying I don't drink coffee, so I'm far from the target customer of this business. I basically just wandered in because I was running WAY early for an appointment one morning and thought I'd grab a muffin for breakfast while I waited.

The staff seemed decent enough, but nothing out of the ordinary. The service was very much ""by the book"" - a quick high, take my order, tell me how much it is, give me my change and a 'have a nice day'. Nothing to write home about in either respect.

The muffin and hot chocolate I got were more of exactly that - same old, same old. You could get pretty much the exact same thing in any coffee shop that's ever existed. And the prices? Well, they were better than some, but worse than others. Yep, yet another reason that this place failed to make an impression either way.

The only things that made me go more positive than negative about this place was the fact that the decor is rather nice, the comination of products gave the whole shop a very pleasent aroma, and (one of my favorite things to see in such an establishment) FREE WIFI!

So, if you're looking for the best tastes and the lowest prices, or even the cheeriest staff? My one experience tells me this is not the place. But if you want a nice relaxing place to sit down with a moderately priced, run of the mill warm beverage while surfing the net? Then 'Urban Bean' is a pretty solid choice.",2

We get there and my mom immediately says this is our new place because the atmosphere was great and they were so kind. We were both done and went up to pay, online their price for a gel fill said 25 dollars and they charged me 35 I asked why it was different and she said ""Oh we charge 15 extra to fill if you already have gel on your acrylics"" I've never heard of that before at any salon I went to AND she must've pulled 35 out of her behind because 25+15 is not 35 but I wasn't going to tell her because then she would've charged me for a full set like come on a fill should not be 40 dollars!!!!! Then their price for a regular pedi was 30 dollars not bad and we got to the front and it came out to 37 we asked why and the lady said ""Oh I forgot to tell you the lady that did your toes is a private contractor"" IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR YOU PAY THEM MORE DO NOT CHARGE MORE!!!!

I personally don't own a dog, but my friend who came along with me on this particular visit does. This was a great opportunity for him to check the place out. Fresh baked dog biscuits are made daily. I'm afraid to admit this, but they actually smelled quite good. A bevy of pet products are there for the choosing including pet beds, raw dog food, leashes, toys and more.

If your best friend is getting a little ripe, bring him down. Bring your dog too! You can wash him yourself for a fee, or even have the pet groomer on site wash and clip your pup. The washing and grooming areas are kept separate from the rest of the store. We all know how wet dog smells, and that's not an issue in the parts of the store where you may not want to have to smell that. 

A boutique for your barker. Prices seemed fairly reasonable with an adequate selection of dog and cat care products. As the sign on the side of the building points out, there's plenty of barking spaces in the back of the store.",1

The Vitamin Department has everything you could ever look for to help your well being and they are always extravaganzas in the stores so you are always getting the most out of your money, and in times like these I know people are very appreciative of that since groceries are becoming more and more expensive everyday, or so it seems!

The staff was not very friendly and we were not greeted when we got to the register. The girl taking our order was wearing gloves when she took my money, and I'm really hoping she changed them before handling food. 

The restaurant itself has a lot of tables for two but not many tables for a larger group of people. We chose a table/booth combination and unfortunately the table top was dirty. I asked the employee if she could wipe down the table or provide me with a rag to wipe it down myself. The carpet was dirty and the service was very slow considering there were not many people in the restaurant. 

Overall, the food was good. I had just a cup of broccoli and cheddar soup, the little one had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with yogurt and apple juice, and Adam had you pick two with a chipotle chicken sandwich and broccoli cheddar soup.

He didn't disappoint me. Thank you Andre! I should even have more than 50 check-ins if only I signed up on Yelp earlier!

I always go with the large sized drink fruit (Passion Fruit, Lychee, Mango, Kiwi) green teas + honey boba. They would even ask if the drink tasted okay or if it needs to be more or less sweetened. Had a lot of stamped cards accumulated to get me free drinks after!

This is my go to place if I need a quick ""craving satisfied"" blah. I always hang out here with my girls, Charlene and Jolene after work just to vent or just talk on random things (we order Crepes in between the talking sessions) we even would last 6 hours in this place and it gets so busy but the turnarounds are quick!

I went to the Scottsdale location for a drug screen. First, I do not have a drug or alcohol problem. Second, the questions you are asked are leading & already assumes you have an addiction. For example, I was asked when was the last time I was drunk. I answered, when I was 21 yrs. old. The next question was, so you've been an alcoholic for 20 years?  NO, I don't drink....period. Another question: how long have you abused drugs/alcohol? My answer is I don't. The next question: when was the last time you abused drugs/alcohol? My answer is never. This 'counselor,' whose credentials are unknown, told me I am in denial, I am an addict, and I must attend a Level 2 DUI class that I have to pay for....or go to jail. 

I was not there because of a DUI or drug charge. I was there because my boyfriend slammed his front door on my foot & refused to open the door to release my foot, so I shouldered the door to free myself. The prosecutors office REFUSED to drop the charges & told me to do the drug screen & then they would. My personal doctors & therapist have written letters saying I don't have any addiction issues....apparently this Justice Services place, upon talking with you for 50 minutes, knows better then medical doctors who have known you for YEARS. 

This place is a legally run City scam where their job us to generate money no matter what.

Windows requested: front and all rear.
Date of Window Tint: 2/9/13

Being new to the PHX area, I researched online for tint shops and came across The Mobile Tint Team.  They were friendly and I chose to bring my new car to them.

I arrived on 2/9, met with Kip (nice guy) and he proceeded to do the work.  Afterwards, he informed me, as standard practice, that it will take a few days for the tint to settle.  After about a week, I noticed that 3 windows needed to be re-done.  One was bubbling up and the other two had lint/hair(?) trapped between the film and the window.  This is ironic because while the company has the ability to work mobile, I was advised to bring it in to their ""clean shop"".

I understand that sometimes these things happen but when I called back, I didn't get the feeling that I was a priority.  I travel often and so I needed the company to be flexible but all I received was, ""I'm busy right now but free this many weeks out"".  Long story short, I went back on 3/30 (between my travel and their schedule) to finally get it corrected.  When I showed the work to Kip, he was trying to make light of it, ""Oh, that's our signature line in the tint..."".  No apology - no ""I'm sorry you had to give up your time to come back to fix the problem that I created"".  Nothing...  

Long story short, they corrected the problem but the experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  I'm sure Kip has done some great work, as evidence by some of the positive reviews - my disappointment is with the post customer service.

In good faith, I cannot recommend them nor will I visit them again when I get a new car.  Again, nothing to do with the people per se, just bad experience post installation.",3

9096,2,1548028800000,"I am definitely a francophile, and I have been wanting to properly enjoy a meal at Bouchon for a while now.  Nothing to me is more satisfying than a lengthy brunch with delicious cup of coffee, fresh baguette and delectable butter and of course a Croque Madame.  Needless to say, I did all of the above when I had brunch at Bouchon last month in Vegas.

We had about a 30 minute wait that went surprisingly quick.  The service was good from start to finish with a few hiccups here and there with our coffee/tea orders.  Fresh baguettes are dropped onto the tables directly from the servers with butter, and they keep it coming!  Don't load up on the bread though!! No matter how good it is... just try to save some room.

We shared an order of the Beignets du Jour of course because only at Bouchon can you essentially start your meal with dessert.  These were a treat!  The ""spice"" aspect gave these beignets something that most beignets don't offer.  I thought it went really well with the jam.  The Nutella put it a little over the top for me.  For my main, I had the Croque Madame.  Be prepared - the serving is huge.

9096,3,1548201600000,"Lawry's is the best prime rib Las Vegas has to offer, period. 

@ Prime Rib - You come here for the prime rib. They have a variety of cuts ranging in different prices. in terms of price, the beef bowl is the best bang for your buck, IF you can finish the 24 oz (w/ bone) of prime rib goodness for $49. The Lawrys cut is around 10oz of prime rib for $36.  The best for most people.The California cut is around 6oz for $32. Not worth it unless you have a small appetite. It may be worthwhile to just share a beef bowl if you're planning on doing a California + Lawrys cut. There are more cuts, but I think these are the only cuts you should be interested.

Also, you must get rare or medium rare. It just makes the carver sigh if you order any other temperature of meat. If you don't eat your meat red, you really have to try it just once. Its worth it.

@ Bread - Good bread is the type of bread that makes you keep grabbing more before your delicious prime rib comes out. This would have been the case if I wasn't getting a beef bowl.

@ Spinning Bowl Salad - Being the guy I am, I really don't like my greens. But this salad was very fresh and just good. Spinning your food before eating must make everything taste better!

@ Yorkshire Pudding - This is actually bread. People seem to love this, I don't. This is more of a personal preference though.

@ Mash Potatoes - This is really the only disappointing item. It just lacks flavor and just doesn't have the nice smooth mash potatoes texture that I want. I love mash potatoes, so this was a big deal for me. My favorite mash potatoes is the one at Cheesecake Factory, and they give you mountains of that stuff! Yum

Besides the prime rib, one of the strongest key points is the attention to detail. Service is top notch. The wait staff is very friendly and very attentive. You're treated like a king or queen here. The first time you come here, you'll be awed by the presentation of the spinning bowl salad. They also provided you a cold fork just for your salad. Drinks are refilled fast. If you have leftovers, they package everything for you. Lastly, if you babies in your party, they provide you stands for the baby car seats. All of this attention to detail is what separates those 4 star and 5 star restaurants. 

This is a nice restaurant, so try to dress appropriately. However, they really don't enforce any dress code. I did come in shorts, a t-shirt, and flip flops and they didn't seem to mind. I did feel like I was underdress though.

If a cute girl wants to go to Lawrys, you take her here. No excuses. There is no substitution in Vegas. The smile in her face at the end of the meal will be worth the price you pay.

Other than the mash potatoes, I have zero complaints about this place. I want to give this place a 5 star for the great prime rib, service, and attention to detail, but the disappointing mash potatoes just won't let me give this place a 5 star.

I knew going in that this cuisine was friendly towards those who have dietary restrictions or are vegetarians. Merkato offers a vegetarian plate that can easily serve two people. The meal comes out on a large platter lined with the traditional bread and eight generous samples of different items. There were two styles of lentils, sauteed cabbage and carrots, spinach, a lettuce and tomato salad, a chilled salad using the injera bread, and two types of paste. It is enough food for two grown men to leave satisfied. At first we were surprised by the injera because it was cold to the touch, spongy, and then when eaten had a strong sour taste. After the initial shock, it did not hinder us from ripping at the three large rolls that came with the meal. The fun in eating is finding the best combinations of flavor. The two curry-esque powder items were good on their own, but when mixed with the spinach or the cabbage they were even better. The lentils had an al dente texture and were my favorite. When we were finished, we left feeling satisfied for only $10.81 before tip.

This experience has left me excited to come back and try more.",2

The food was awesome tho, we got the margarita flat bread, spinach dip w/pita and lobster spread w/crackers all worth trying. As for drinks we ordered a couple martinis & a mango mojito all were pretty good except the one thing that pissed off my fiancé was that when he got his martini which comes with a shaker to pour your own glass, the waitress advised that the shaker was uneven with the top, so of course when we poured it 3rd of the drink leaked thru the side of the shaker, and the waitress could care less!

9146,3,1547683200000,"Stayed here for 3 nights.  Here's a real quick breakdown:

Pros:
Clean and spacious room
Decent pool, deepest it goes is 4.5 ft I think.
Shuttle to the strip 4x a day, but that's also a con.

Cons:
TV didn't work
No fridge in room
Distance from strip
Thin walls.  Our experience was we could actually hear someone snoring in the next room.
Few people working the front desk, which means longer waits.


We stayed here to try and save some money, but ended up paying more for taxis anyway (and who doesn't love getting Vegas history lessons from taxi drivers?), so next time we'll just stay somewhere on the strip.  It's just more convenient and I would advise you to do the same, unless you're driving.  It's not a bad stay, but I wouldn't stay here again unless I had no other choice.",2

Light flaky batter, big chunk of fish ... Fantastic! Even my Cajun fries were awesome. Husband had crawfish etoufee, it was awesome. We shared a pound of king crab legs in the mixture of all four sauces prepared to medium spice, I was seriously sad when we were all done, I wanted more of all of it not because I was still hungry but because it was so good!

Ok, it's odd that it's dog friendly, but I'd rather smell dog than smoke any day.

Rates are good, the rooms are spotless (we had one with the big jacuzzi tub - well worth the few extra dollars.)

Yes, the cable sucks - and even if we are in Vegas some of us do want excellent cable coverage, and this didn't have it....never could find NBC.

9189,3,1548028800000,"Sunday Brunch Review: 

Not sure I would have found this place if I wasn't with someone who knew where it was. I luhh the vibe of this place, but I just love wine bars in general. The wood/metal combo just does it for me. When you first walk in the space is narrow and features the bar area. Head towards the back and it expands to an open area with tables and booths. No need for ressies there was no wait.

I ordered the veggie omelette and it had ALL THE VEGGIES! It had bell peppers, zucchini squash, tomato, mushroom, swiss chard, AND spinach! Like how did they fit all of them in this omelette?! But really, the veggies tasted so fresh! Most likely one of the best omelette's I've had. So this AMAZEE omelette came with a large serving of breakfast potatoes. I am more of a well done type of girl when it comes to breakfast potatoes/home fries/hash browns. So these ones were not exactly my type, but I don't mind because it stopped me from eating all of them. Other orders at the table featured the pumpkin pancakes, & the V breakfast. Our server was pleasant & attentive so no complaints there.

Now for the most important part of brunch... the beverages. My table ordered a bottle of already mixed blood orange mimosa. Split between 4 people we each got 1.5 glasses of BOM and it came out to $8 per person. According to the other humans at my table the carafes don't have the IDEAL ratios. 

So if you are tight on ca$h money not sure this is the best place for a boozy brunch, but if you want a BOMB veggie omelette this is the place. 

Will return for dinner & wine.",2

Incompetence is probably the best way to describe it. Clients are screaming murder at the front staff and the manager just laid back talking to his buddies and pretended to ignore and even let the poor guy get walloped. It was a busy day and this happens? So much for a peaceful, enjoyable relaxing lunch?

My personal experience is that such lax management means there's a lot of corners being cut somewhere else. Where are the standards? Are they being trained to be oblivious?

Our waiter Kevin was prompt even as he collected more tables towards the end of the night.  He is extremely nice and very good at what he does.  We ordered a bunch of food and Chris came out to greet us.  He was extremely nice and the lobster sliders were out of this world.  The decor is trendy but not tacky.  Pricing was pleasantly surprising.  We expected to cringe at our bill but felt it was completely fair.  Parking is a bit of a concern but considering the location (across from Consol) it is to be expected.  If you have the opportunity visit this place you will be happy that you did.,2
9210,1,1548201600000,"VISUAL AESTHETIC: 4.9/5
The location is at a visible area and is very unique, with a red and white awning that sort of gives a street food feel. Inside there is an old nostalgic essence that depicts Korea and how street food cart areas would be set up. The colors are drab with heavy pops of beautiful saturated red. There's are golden pots hung along the roofing of one section which is quirky and very cute. Overall the decor is quite nice, old movie posters and school books to banners with word play on different signs. However, during busy hours, the abundance of smoke is sort of annoying. The fans do little to really take away the large clouds floating amongst the restaurant and the ceiling in the venue is actually quite high. 

FOOD: 4/5
I find this sort of strange and this is all opinion but Hobak does not serve barley tea, a common staple amongst Korean restaurants. However, the iced water is fine.

The side dishes were fresh but alright in taste. The green onion salad lacks the namesake, green onion but I don't mind the bean sprouts so this did not bother me much. I make the steamed egg at home and add a kind of fermented shrimp in to add flavor and because Hobak did not have this, the taste was quite bland. It is common for Korean barbecue restaurants to remove salt within recipes due to the salt that is added with marinated meat and dipping sauces. 

The salad had a sort of black sesame dressing which was delicious but the iceberg lettuce was sparse and I find that most KBBQ restaurants give romaine lettuce. I asked for lettuce wraps but Hobak does not provide this service. I had to ask for a bowl of rice, which is uncommon at most Asian restaurants in general because rice is typically served with a meal. 

I ordered the Family Combo 1 which includes the ribeye, pork belly, pork ribs (marinated), and beef (marinated). The cheese and grilled mushroom and sweet potatoes were a nice addition. 

The meat was of good quality, however lacking in variety. I have been to various KBBQ restaurants in Las Vegas and found multiple ones that have gems which include options I haven't seen here in America unless you were out in LA. 

SERVICE: 2/5
From the reviews, I saw that this location supposedly provides great service. I did not experience that in the slightest. The service was moderate and the workers were slightly attentive but I was very uncomfortable at the unfriendly behavior. What shocked me though, was the actions of one of the workers, Myunghee. I was appalled at not only the way she reacted towards me but her fellow employees. 

One young man (today was his second day) came over to take our order and he was friendly and prompt, but in all honesty, had no idea how to explain the menu. This is understandable though, due to the short amount of time he has been working at Hobak. Myunghee had stopped by our table shortly after to take our order and when I explained I had already given it to another employee, she stomped off without a word and proceeded to interrogate the young man who took my order, asking him why he took our order and what it was that I ordered. 

I was sort of shocked but dismissed it as her being in a hurry to serve other customers. Shortly after however, it was no longer busy due to it being after lunch time. I was further astonished when I watched as she barked orders at employees and yelled at individuals, including the new worker. At one point, she began telling off an employee in Korean even though I had just spoke to her in Korean moments before the occurrence. 

This was rude, unprofessional, and embarrassing. Regardless if an employee has done something incorrectly, it is unacceptable to yell at them in front of a customer. Especially if a customer understands what you are saying. Regardless of this fact, people know how to read body language and it was very wrong to treat your colleague so unprofessionally in public. This is not only reflected poorly on Myunghee herself, but also on Hobak. 

OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 2.7/5
This is not a restaurant I will be returning to. I felt as though the interior was adorable and that the decor really reminded me of Korean nostalgia, however I cannot find myself enjoying the lack of variety and professionalism at this restaurant. I really wanted to enjoy this location due to the wide acclaim and the response amongst my peers, but the horrible service was not worth it.",2

Love usage this greenway is getting from all of the updates. Seems that there is a big push for more grassy areas and it's paying in more traffic, too.

I always order the same thing and it's the mango green tea with boba or the mango tea latte with the sea salt foam and boba. It is always packed though, but that's good for them cuss their business is popping. The workers are always nice and they work hard to make your drinks quick. Another bonus is the stamp reward system they have. I believe it's buy 10 drink and get the next one free (regular size). If you wanna upgrade your drink to a large, you just pay the difference. I love this place and I can't thank the employees enough for the fast service. Keep up the good work!",2

9296,3,1546992000000,"I admit I had my reservations dining in the middle of a mall, albeit a nice one, dining in the treehouse room felt intimate and classy.  In the grand scheme of steakhouses, I'd rate the food a solid 4, perhaps a 5, but the attention to detail by the staff, fantastic cocktails, wonderful ambiance, and late hours helped Mastro's earn a 5th star in its belt.

I was a bit peeved that we had to wait almost 30 minutes for our table at the bar, but the generous cocktail pours helped soothe the senses.  Plus, we were late to our reservation by an hour and a half so I had to throw them a bone (haha!).  We arrived around 10:30pm and were surprised to find a happening bar scene and a 75% full dining room.  We left past 1am, but the staff was gracious and didn't try to rush us out even when we were the second to last table in the restaurant.

The food was delicious.  We may have over ordered on the appetizers, but we hadn't eaten in 12 hours so we figured we would indulge a bit.  Very fresh oysters with all the fixings with lemon halves that were wrapped in cheesecloth and speared onto a fork.  Great detail.  Smoked salmon plate was also good.  The fried calamari was ok - good, but certainly have had better.  My bone-in rib-eye was great.  Cooked a little past medium rare, but still tasted wonderful - a nice char on the outside, lightly salted crust.  The side dishes were also good, in particular the mac and cheese, but get it while it's still warm.  At the end of our meal, our coffee order came out a bit lukewarm, but it was close to closing time so I gave them a pass.  In honor of the groom, the staff also brought out a dessert with the words ""Don't do it!"" written in chocolate on the borders of the plate.  Again, great attention to detail.

I really think this is where Mastro's shines.  The details.  We were asked whether we wanted a black napkin versus a white one to minimize lint getting onto dark pants when we sat down.  I just received a phone call today asking whether we enjoyed our experience and to visit again.  I might have had a better steak elsewhere (not by much), but it's a real pleasure to dine somewhere that focuses on the little details that elevate a dining experience into a fine dining experience.  Bravo Mastro's - I will be back.",2

Anyone knows the bread makes a poboy as much as what you put in it. The hard crusty fried shrimp was equally bad and I think there were like 3. It was the saddest excuse for a poboy I had ever witnessed. Of course I get the place isn't called Angry Poboy...it's the angry crab. Not really sure I'll be back in any case.,2

The inside was nice and resembled going to a BJ's. We ended up getting 2 flights of mostly their house beer. Overall the beer was not amazing but was not bad. We tried the house Blueberry, Freak'n Red, House orange ginger Saison, wren stout, helio pale ale, house amber, sun up brown, house brown, freak'n oatmeal and house blonde. There are a lot of varieties to their drink menu which is a big plus when coming during happy hour between 3pm-6pm mon-Friday ($2.00 off house beers, shared plates, well drink and house wines/$1.00 all other drafts) the food we ordered was amazing! The pretzels and beer cheese fondue dip was top notch, soft pretzels and hot cheesy goodness. The fried cauliflower and buffalo sauce on the side was definitely something we will continue to get as well. Our waitress Laura was very attentive and engaging with great recommendations.

9353,3,1548201600000,"Sombrero's is everything I want in my neighborhood Mexican joint: The flavors are bold and spicy, the food is fresh, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly.

The open burrito with barbacoa is my jam. While I like Chipotle as much as the next person and appreciate their ethical/fresh choices, the open burrito from Sombrero's is MEXICAN food. One day I'll try other things (they let you sample the different meats), but my love for the barbacoa open burrito runs deep and it's hard to stray. My companion is a fan of the green chili beef, which is REALLY spicy--too spicy for me, but he's into that sort of thing.

Both of the extra hot salsas at the salsa bar (there's a green and a yellow one) are spicy and flavorful. They're not unbearably spicy, but they'll make you sweat for sure. I thought I only liked tomato-based salsas until I had these. I ignore the others (in part because I always get take-out and the more watery salsas don't travel well).

The horchata really does taste like melted ice cream. Get it.

I happened upon the office bc I had to stop at the post office across he street. We're new to AZ and in need of re-establishing most of our preventative care. Walked in to get some info and was immediately greeted with a smile and hello. They were attentive and helpful with every question I had. I and my daughter were offered a tour of the office and patient areas without hesitation. I can not say enough great things about the thought they put into all things kids. Very welcoming seats (big dinasours rather than a cold chair) a video above lights so kiddos can watch while the dentist checks out they're teeth, a great play area if your waiting with other kiddos. There are iPads and laptops as well as a large TV in the lobby. 
They fit us in for a cleaning and initial
Check-up while we were there.  Dr Olga, as well as all of the staff; was warm, friendly and attentive. Answered every question and concern I had and really put my mind at ease. 
My daughter did amazing. They were so great with her. I was extremely concerned before walking in, that this would be a horrible experience for both of us, but was greatly surprised that it went seamless and my little girl walked out with the biggest smile on her face!

I booked this appointment yesterday. I gave the woman my ID card info, the day I made the appointment. Today my ID card was no where to be found. So I was gonna cancel my appt, these people called me to reschedule. They specifically told me they woundnt need my card that I would be okay. But I really don't even think she knew if that was ok. I got there at 11 am and left at 2:30 pm they never verified my insurance. They kept claiming they called and there was no record of me in the system, so I called, 30 minutes wasted because who ever gets paid to do it gave up. Never did they let me know anything. Total waste of my time. They don't even take HMO, but when you call they Claim they take ALL insurance. The dentist seemed nice, and another guy was helping me. He was really trying so kudos to having him. The other back office staff were rude, making little smart disrespectful comments. So I would not recommend this dental office until people who know their job are actually working. These people were socializing and not working. I paid for their social hours with my gas,my time, and worst of all I have to start the process somewhere else.  Soooo all the bells and whistles of this office mean nothing.

9402,3,1548201600000,"I've been to several Korean BBQs in my home state of Florida and I have to say this one is the best I've experienced.

The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. I've often had the stigma of being Caucasians in an Asian restaurant and not being experts on the cuisine and either getting poor quality help due to language barriers or poor quality help due to being an outsider. Here the staff was friendly, well-spoken, and knew exactly how to help some Caucasians that didn't quite know what they wanted.

Our waitress suggested a seafood noodle soup that she assured us would be excellent for leftovers, and I knew I wanted some good beef so I opted for the ribeye to grill at the table. The soup was loaded with noodles, vegetables, and tons of whole shrimp, mussels, and squid all cooked perfectly.

The BBQ came out on a nice flat skillet with a small portable propane grill underneath. The ribeye was extremely tendered and well flavored, served with a raw onion to grill alongside and the traditional banchan. Every single one, from the fish cakes to the eggplant, were tasty and just the right bit to accompany our meat. Fresh romaine and a bowl of rice came as usual, but the kicker was a miso-broth based soup that I have no idea what was in it aside from tofu but it was delicious and an unexpected star of the meal.

All of that was under $40 and gave us 2 days worth of leftovers. The restaurant was clean and inviting and the menu had plenty on it to make it worth coming back. The only complaint I can say is that it's a bit difficult to find, being on the 2nd floor of the Asian Town Center.

9445,1,1547769600000,"I'd been anticipating Tesco's new concept entering the Phoenix area for quite a while and after visiting for the first time, I'm unabashedly hooked.  I will not likely shop at any other place for groceries -- as the produce is gorgeous, their meat is proportioned into perfect dinner servings, their selection of national, name-brand products are concise but available, and their wine is CHEAP.  

Those are all the makings of a perfect grocery experience, especially since i'm spending about 1/3 to  1/2 of what i would spend on a typical grocery trip to Safeway or Trader Joes.

Did i mention that their wine is CHEAP?!  The Recoleta Malbec is FOUR FREAKING DOLLARS!  I buy 5 at a time to last the whole week ;-)

I also recommend their artichokes, which are jumbo sized and quite unavailable in the same proportions at Safeway or TJs.  And, as i mentioned before their presentation on all of the fresh produce makes you want to stock up on EVERYTHING, and at farmer's market prices.  It really is amazing, this store.  

Good selection of seafood and other meats.  I particularly enjoy their pork chops, and i bought 1.5 lbs of top sirloin the other day to cut up into kabobs for about $8.  

All your basic needs are present here, and they have a nice selection of everything you need, from name-brand to Tesco's own Fresh & Easy brand as a generic (but still quality).  

As I mentioned already, I won't do my grocery shopping anywhere else, other than to pick up a few random items (beer, breakfast cereal, water -- because F&E's selection is poor) at Safeway.",2

9466,3,1547596800000,"I had been to a few other Oregano's before, and was always impressed.  The food is usually 4 star worthy, but the service itself has always been 5 stars.  I seriously cannot remember receiving such great service at a restaurant in a long time.  My wife, son, and buddy who was out here from Vegas, decided to come down to this location before we went to the Padre game.  We arrived at around 11:15 and were seated right away.  We placed our order for a large garden salad, an order of garlic bread, a small stuffed pizza with sausage and spinach and a small pepperoni pan pizza.  Here is how everything was............

Large Garden Salad-  Oregano's salads are massive!  They can feed a small army.  We each ate about 2 bowls full, and there were still leftovers.  Our waitress brought us our own individual dressings, too!  It was a pretty basic salad, but it gave us something to eat while waiting for the pizzas to cook (45 minutes or so).  The Italian dressing was very good!

Garlic Bread-  Solid!  About a 2 foot long loaf of garlic bread.  It had the perfect amount of butter/oil and garlic.  It tasted great!  I could have ate another loaf of it!  Everyone at the table thought it was great!

Stuffed Pizza-  I had only had Oregano's stuffed pizza once before, and it was fantastic!  My buddy is a huge sausage and spinach fan, so we went with those toppings.  Their stuffed pizza is a sight to see!  It's cut into 6 slices and each slice is about a pound.  Oregano's sausage is fantastic!  The spinach they use was pretty fresh, too.  It was a good combo of flavors.  We each ate 2 slices and were pretty much stuffed.  I took the other 2 slices home for leftovers.

Pan Pizza-  This was the first time I had experienced their pan pizza.  It was good, but not as good as their stuffed or thin crust Chicago style.  We got this one mostly for my wife, but it turns out she really didn't care for it.  She didn't like the sauce (Everyone that I have talked to that doesn't like Oregano's, doesn't like the sauce.)  I ate one slice and we took home about 4 slices.  Reheated the next day, it tasted fine.  I don't know if I would get the pan pizza again, but there was nothing wrong with it and it was pretty tasty.

On to why this place gets 5 stars.......THE SERVICE!  Our waitress was absolutely awesome!  She was very friendly, personable and happy.  She kept our drinks filled, plates cleared etc.  She even mentioned that we were the most easy going table she had all day and that she appreciated our laid back attitude.  Nice!  Every other employee I encountered was very welcoming, too.  That is 3 for 3 on different Oregano's, as far as receiving beyond excellent service.  That alone will keep me coming back!  Food is a solid 4, but the service always bumps it up to a 5 IMO.",2

Furthermore, the wait time is not a problem because the waitess offered us prompt service. Now this place become where we often hang out in Squirrel Hill area.",2
9482,2,1547856000000,"I'm not very fond of the dentist, but Dr. Nguyen's work is impressive. He answers all my questions and is very friendly. He makes you feel at ease before he does his work and he asks you to do things instead of just forcing you to turn your head or open your mouth. 

First time I came in was for a deep cleaning and although somewhat painful he did his best to make it more comfortable for me. Every time he thought I was in pain he'd stop to make sure I was okay. 

Second visit was for an extraction. I was awake the whole time. Not the most pleasant experience but it definitely wasn't as bad as my first extraction in the military. I actually woke up and had a little squabble with the office during the operation. 

Overall great experience. If you live around the area definitely worth your while to bring your business here.",2
9490,2,1548720000000,"I like coming here mainly because the race & sports book is 24/7. I do all my football bets here and been super lucky here! LOL. They also have a variety of slot machines, table games, & a poker room if you want to do a little gambling. It's convenient coming here because they also have a buffet, restaurants, a movie theatre, bowling, & bingo. If you go bowling after midnight the games are only $1 & bingo is every odd hr so for example 11am, 1pm, etc. I been lucky a few times in bingo & sometimes it can get pretty busy. They also host shows here, a popular one are the rodeo shows so you'll see a ton of people in cowboy hats & boots on those days. Overall, I just like coming to hang out here because it's pretty chill and I've always had a good time.",2
9500,3,1546732800000,The staff here at this location are on point.   They are super polite and willing to help in anyway they can.

9503,1,1547424000000,yummmmmmy. This place is just delicious and the portions are freaking huge! I don't have much to say because all the other reviewers pretty much said what I have to say. You really just have to come and try this place for yourself. You won't be disappointed! Also... Their gravy is DELICIOUS.,2

On top of that, 2 other people had come and gone and received their orders in a timely manner. When I asked Daniela to check on my order she was VERY rude. Also, I did not receive everything I ordered. It is sad, because I love the food, but we will never go back to that location.",2

It's more like the smaller lounges in Chelsea (Manhattan) smaller, more intimate than the gargantuan mega clubs which are fun too but Blush is a nice way to change it up. I went on a Tuesday and it was a really good DJ but the crowd (like the rest of the Wynn) is like an Asian invasion. So... ladies if you are into handsome Asian guys THIS is the spot. I'm not so from a meeting guys perspective this place was a bit lacking. The men were waaay hotter when I first came here in 2007. But the Asians dance awesome and they are super friendly so I had a blast :) 

Drinks pricey but made to perfection.",2
9543,1,1546473600000,"Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyy!! REAL FOOD! FINALLY!
I got to have dinner at Rawlicious yesterday and I am thrilled. From filtered water to organic everything I can eat at this place with total peace of mind. I don't have to ask if the juice is from the 'gun', I don't have to drink water that reeks like chlorine and I can indulge in a sweet treat without any guilt.

I shared a smoothie and appetizer salad with a friend, had a main and still had room for dessert. I do wish they had a little more variety on the menu; I appreciate them being gluten-free but if they used wheat they could have a few more options. Also I'd love to see them serving alkaline water, that would really earn them a full 5 stars.

Their decor is so cozy and nice, I felt like I was in the home of a good friend. I will definitely be going back to support this local restaurant.",2

9550,2,1548028800000,"Hubby and I wanted bbq. Once u enter the place u understand the concept: simple, straightforward, and clean. This place is wonderful because the meat is legit with healthy options. I had salad with brisket on top. The romaine was crunchy, crisp and really dark green.  I got a mix with kale and I appreciate them lightly steaming/blanching the kale so it's flavorful than when it's raw (dry). I choose jicama, red peppers, rainbow cherry tomatoes, and cukes. $9. I wanted to try their ribs so I got 2 pieces for $4. Fabulous. Others wrote it fatty but I'm ok with it. It falls off the bones. Hubby got salad brisket as well with a side of their mac and cheese. Small side is $2. People might complain about their mac but I see it more on the healthy side: not too cheesy dense-it lightly covered the bases. The ice tea is freshly brewed with 3 varieties: unsweetened, sweetened and watermelon. I appreciate this because I hate the processed Nestea crap and other commercial flavored teas out there. There was thought put to everything.",2

I lost count on all the bad reviews its crazy JUST READ SOME AND AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE ITS LIKE A BROKEN RECORD. , plus any good reviews were mostly someone having a drink.

One time I told a waitress and she said it looked like mine! It was a short brown hair and I have long blondish-brown hair. I don't think so.

9579,2,1547424000000,"Usually only order their Grilled Chix Salad which is good. They make home made ranch dressing and their salads have no cheese which I prefer. And of course, since this is PGH, fries are included. Definitely recommend.",1
9580,2,1548720000000,"I really liked this place.  Stopped in right after opening on Sunday - I was the lone customer and found a spot at the bar.  By the time I was done, they had a pretty good crowd.

My server was named ""English"" (guessing that's an alias).  I think I heard another employee call him Dave, but I don't hear very well.  English did a great job and was talkative, likable, and friendly.

Like some other reviewers, I found many things on the menu I wanted to order...but I was all by my lonesome.  I really need to find some friends!  Here's what I tried:

---  Oysters:  The oysters were fabulous.  They only had two choices, so I snarfed down three of each.  Great value.
---  Shrimp Mint:  I really liked the flavor combinations but they were a little light on the ikura.  I've had better ikura in North Dakota, so I'm not complaining here...
---  Pork Belly Kim Chi Fried Rice:  I was surprised by how much I liked this.  The kim chi flavor was quite muted.  The pork belly, mushrooms, and fried egg mixed very well with the fried rice.  Every bite tasted better than the previous bite.  
---  Pabst Blue Ribbon:  $3 a pint.  Yeah, buddy.  What's better than a cheap lager combined with great food??  NOT MUCH!!!  Seriously, you ought to try it sometime.

The pricing was very fair, but it sure would be easy to ring up a big tab here.  Another nit to pick - it wasn't hot outside, but it was plenty warm inside the restaurant.  Made me wonder what it's like when the temp is 115 or so.

I would be a regular here if I lived in Vegas.  Would recommend to all but the least adventurous of my friends.",2
9583,2,1548288000000,"Turtlehead Peak was AWESOME! Actually it was pretty EASY (don't let the reviews scare you) if you are in OK shape. 

Just follow the trail - go around the two fingers (a landmark) and attack the mountain from the side.  

Tips;

Use Trekking Poles - they help a lot by increasing stability on the descent (that's why Mountain Goats are so agile - 4 legs are better than 2)

Wear real Hiking Boots - I use Lowa Zephyr GTX, which are German made - super light (used by a lot of Army ""Special"" people, Hardcore Hikers, and Real Estate Agents).  Once you put them on - you feel like Spider Man/Woman/in-between - and you 'all of sudden' get these 'special powers' that allow you to leap from rock to rock.

Bring food - a sandwich, no burritos (don't stink up the trail), some trail mix and two (2) water bottles would be sufficient or maybe some Russian Vodka to celebrate at the top.

Bonus - Smiling and Happy Hikers

I met some really FRIENDLY people from all over the world.   I noticed how friendly  the Hikers are (as opposed to the tourists on the strip - filthy gambling whore-mongering, *wait* that's a different review).  Haha.  The Hiking community is quite the 'model' demographic of decent, fit, and generally speaking - emotionally stable people.

The View - It's all worth it!

By the way, the views at the top are spectacular. Bring a camera.  Today it was perfect, but once in a while it gets windy - so bring an extra layer - because it can get nippy.  If you get too cold you can wait in the lounge and take the elevator back down - just joking.

Sign the Guestbook - You made it - your a Winner, you are NOT a whining sorry-ass lazy _____ of a person. Haha.  Just joking . . .

As customary - for those that make it to the top - you should sign the guestbook inside the Ammo Box.

Next step - After the hike, go to a buffet and PIG OUT!

By the way if you want to get in good shape

I've been doing the High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), it's sort of like Cross Fit.  It get's you in shape fast, and you get strong as well.  Try it.  You'll eat the Turtlehead for breakfast and still have loads of energy for Saphhires *wink*  *wink* Haha, just joking.",2

Vraiment moins impressionnant. On manque toute l'ambiance si jolie et feutrée. Vous aurez compris qu'il est important de réserver haha
Les cocktails étaient vraiment très bons. 
Comme plats, nous en avons choisi quatre. Quantité raisonnable pour deux personnes, mais les plats sont excessivement chers pour les portions servies. 
Nous avons commencé avec les Dim Sum au poulet et les rouleaux aux canards. Rien à dire, simplement parfait!
Nous avons ensuite pris le satay de poulet et le hamachi popcorn. Encore une fois délicieux. 
Le service était aussi excellent.

9599,3,1548288000000,"Food was quite good, but our server suggested we order all of our food in the beginning, assuring us that she would pace how it was brought to the table.  It was not paced ... We were totally rushed and the food runner was actually pissy with us when we didn't adequately clear our food for the large paella plate.  Some of the other food had arrived only a few minutes earlier.  

Best of the night:  bacon wrapped dates, Serrano ham, cauliflower, peppers, and coffee ice cream with candied olives (a sweet and savory punch of yum!).  Eggplant was okay, as was lobster paella.  The sourdough bread with the cheese course was very delicious.

The atmosphere is lovely and has a contemporary feel with neat light fixtures and a casual vibe.  I would recommend going, but DO NOT order all your food dishes at once.  Order your next plates after the first ones arrive, etc.",2

I can't cope with Tim's coffee anymore so started popping in here instead.  I've only had coffee and snack things so far.  The rest of the food is like any Druxy's I think.

Coffee is decent but the 4 star rating is more for the staff.  They are so friendly and cheerful.  One woman in particular tends to be on the cash register in the mornings and truly does brighten my day.  Yesterday's exchange:
Me: Extra large coffee please.  It's one of those days.
Her: I thought all the days were like that?  Haha!
Too true....
She doesn't have to be so cheerful and smile so genuinely, but she does and I feel energized leaving-even before I've sipped my coffee!

9609,3,1547424000000,"Being from upstate NY and coming from a town that is predominately Italian, I have searched long and hard for a restaurant that would fulfill the needs of my taste buds.  I grew up eating Italian sausage, baked ziti, chicken parmesan, and meatballs, served with homemade marinara made with tomatoes that we grew in our backyards.

One trip to Giada's, and I realized that this place reminded me of home.  The Chicken Parm, the Meatballs, the Italian Sausage, and Marinara Sauce were absolutely DELICIOUS-- I had flashbacks to my childhood and my tastebuds were finally satisfied-- in my 18 years of living in the Las Vegas area, I had yet to find my back home restaurant, and the day I stepped into Giada's, I knew that this place was it.

The service was excellent, the atmosphere calming and romantic, the wine and beer selection vast, the service friendly and attentive, portions generous, and flavor like no other.  

The owner Daniel personally delivered our appetizer, and even checked back on us after we got our entrees. He told us everything from the menu was one of his grandma's recipes, and his friendly demeanor made me want to go back to eat 2 days later.

CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!! Friendly staff and big portions pleasing to the taste buds!!!  My new favorite authentic Italian ristorante!!",2

I went to have a package sent out and she had a line out the door so she forgot to put the label on my package. So the package got sent right back to my house. I went back and she refused help get the package shipped out again with expedited shipping due to her mistake. She made up the excuse that someone must have ripped the label off or it may have fallen off, even though there was no sign of it being torn off. When I asked to speak to the manager she said she was the only employee and the store owner comes and goes so she couldn't give me her personal number or any other way to speak to her. She said she'd leave her my name and number to call me back and never did. The service is ridiculous, this was my first and last time at this location.",2
9621,1,1546560000000,"I sat on the patio, so I can't comment on the dining experience inside.

The patio setting is great. Very nice place to sit and have a drink. The patio menu is much different from the inside menu. This would be fine, but I don't understand why they chose to offer the food that they did. There is very little on here that is actually shareable, despite what the menu says. Legitimate tapas style patio food would be absolutely perfect in this setting. 

I had the salt brick chicken sandwich -very nice- but it was accompanied by a side of kettle chips that were pretty clearly Ms. Vickies. I love kettle chips, and I'm fine with getting them as a side, but not if I'm being charged $16 for the meal. It just seemed lazy. 

The service was ok I guess, but there were about 4 people who came by our table so it was never really clear who our server was and it lead to long wait times at every stage of the meal. 

Overall, it was disappointing. If I'm paying medium to high prices for drinks and a meal for two it'd be nice to have an experience that isn't firmly mediocre. The whole thing just reeked of missed opportunity. 

The place looks great, the location is fantastic, but everything else is kinda sloppy, sorta lazy, and poorly executed. Since I live in the neighborhood I'll probably be back but it'll be for the setting, nothing else.",2

9627,2,1548374400000,"As everyone else mentioned, the best thing about this place is that it's open 24/7. So, my boyfriend and I came to eat here around 3AM since it was close by and seemingly the only restaurant open at that time. This is definitely more of a Korean restaurant with some Chinese and Japanese items on the menu. There's even a TV playing non-stop Korean music videos on the wall.

Our waitress told us that the only items that weren't available were the bento boxes. Which was fine, because I was craving some soup, so I went with the kimchi jjigae. My boyfriend ordered the orange chicken, which came with rice and broccoli on the side. The panchan came out first, but there were only about 5 sides. I liked my soup, but the chicken was just so-so. It's probably best to stick to the Korean items on the menu. For drinks, soda is served in a can.

The service was good, but there weren't too many people there. On the downside, we were automatically charged 18% gratuity for only two people. I agree that the tipping policy should be mentioned somewhere on the menu, so it's not such a shock!

Expect prices to be high here. It is Vegas, after all. But if you're out really late, and you don't want greasy fast food, this place is worth a try.",2
9628,1,1546300800000,"I owe these folks an updated review. About 10 days before my scheduled departure from Mesa I called Arizona RV Repair and stressed that the clock was running out. They promised that they would be here to do the repairs. They showed up on time and stuck with it for most of three days and didn't quit until the job was finished. The slideout motor replacement turned out to be a bigger job than I thought and it took two days of hard work to get the old motor out.
Once they were on the job, they did really good, thorough professional work. So I guess that my only complaint is that it took a long time to get scheduled but that really didn't cause any problems other than my stress  as long as the work got done before my departure date, which it did. So I'm up voting Arizona RV to 4 stars based on the quality of the work.",2

Actually, there are: first off, he simply dismissed my husband. He showed me a couple options but when I asked him specific questions he kind of him-hawed and then left ""to check"" something for me. The prices advertised were not the same in store but we didn't get a chance to ask because we realized after awhile that we were just dropped, kind of like that one time I tried to hang out with the popular kids in middle school.

My daughter had one of her first sandwiches as a toddler(Turkey) from the Clybourn Location and I just picked another one up on the way to her ASU dorm about 17 years later.  We also shared a weekly trip to another location while she was in pre-k. up until they opened one in our town.

9720,2,1547424000000,"After discovering the delectable mystique of Vosges Haut-Chocolat in the O'Hare Intl Airport a week earlier, I was delighted to find an actual store in The Forum Shops!  

This shop had all the flavors I had been meaning to try, and then some.  It was so enticing, in fact, that I stopped in here 3X during my Vegas visit.  Brian behind the counter helpfully answered my questions and was just generally very nice and knowledgeable, and though the other girl was more hands-off, she was just as nice.  She even recognized and thanked us for visiting their store again the 3rd time around.

The space is small, but they don't need much room to display the products.  Beautiful truffles lay behind a glass case, while chocolate bars lined up on the opposite wall were nestled among several other chocolate-related products.  

Not the most expensive chocolate I've ever paid for, but it's definitely up there at $7.50/bar (same price if you buy online).  It's so worth it.  The packaging is both beautiful and simple at the same time with the purple ink and shiny foils.  I love how the photos capture the deconstructed ingredients.  As for the actual chocolate, flavors are very unique, complex, and even strange, but all somehow cohesive.  All the amazing bars I've tried so far, which admittedly were dark chocolates, have resulted in an explosion of the senses: Black Salt Caramel, Oaxaca, Black Pearl, Red Fire, etc... Can't wait to try the Blood Orange Caramel and Pink Himalayan Salt bars in our latest purchase!  (If you want a more detailed review on the Black Salt Caramel and Red Fire bars, please search for my other Vosges review).

Sitting next to the water jug (for your personal hydration) are some samples, which should be very helpful to any Vosges virgins.  Once you try, you'll want to buy some!

The best part of all was when Brian offered me a complimentary little ice pack to keep my bars from melting in the Vegas heat on the long walk back to my hotel room on the other end of the Strip.

HIGHLY recommended.",2

Celebrating my daughters debut at Symphony Hall I made reservations for a party of 9 which included 3 under 14.  
They were very accommodating, tho I was put on hold twice to make sure it was okay to take the 9 top reservation.  They didn't wait to have us all there before we were seated.  A plus as we had my 99 year old grandfather with us and also had to wait for my daughter to change and arrive.  
The food was from good to stellar, as we all ordered very different things.  Well three of us ordered the chicken stroganoff, which sounded fantastic but seemed to be missing something.  Still quite edible.  We also had the beef stew (I don't know how good it was because my grandfather wouldn't share), meatloaf (delicious) the smashed potatoes and gravy were perfect. I had the scallops, which were exactly what I needed as they were light and complemented my Arrogant 75(s) perfectly.
We ordered each of the desserts to taste them all.  The peanut butter mouse (aka melted peanut butter cup) went VERY well with the hot chocolate cake. I don't know how the blueberry cheesecake was as my grandfather, again, didn't share.  But the salted caramel pudding was hands down MY FAVORITE!!! I'd come back just for that.
You know what else I'd come back for? The service!! Tony was amazing!!! I love to ask questions, and he never once hesitated. His recommendations were spot on. He listened and was so much fun.  I eat out for the total package and Tony was the the perfectly tied bow on top!

The meal did come with a couple of chips and by a couple, I mean a couple. Menu seemed focused on Mexican cuisine and with that, I would assume you would get chips before the meal. Not the case. They did have specials for food and drink which is nice, just didn't apply to my meal today. Given that, the price of my meal did seem a bit high for lunch. If you can set your meal to fall on the day of one of their specials, the price point would be more favorable.

595 was highly anticipated and much needed in the area. The menu is great and the food is delicious. This is a fantastic place to enjoy craft beers and they are very supportive of local breweries. They also regularly host the local beer community for bottle shares and special events.

The reason they don't get 4 stars or more from me (yet) is because of the service. The 1st time I was in there was for a bottle share, which had been planned pretty far in advance. The server who was scheduled to work that day had apparently called in (which is no fault of the restaurants, that stuff happens). In a pinch, they had the wife (I think) of the Manager fill in. It didn't go so well, unfortunately. She wasn't familiar with the beers and we ended up with not 1, but 2 issues with our bill. She charged us for someone elses tab.

He had the peach cobbler crumble. It was a 2 star dish at best. What tasted like and had the mouth feel of canned peaches with cinnamon added were covered in nothing more than granola. And there were so many peaches!! TOO MANY peaches. It was the ramiken where peaches go to die I think. The dish is served ala mode and where the scoop of ice cream is... there's no cobbler underneath. He felt a bit jilted by this. As if the canned peaches weren't enough, you're going to scoop out a hand-balls size piece of it for the ice cream? 
We both enjoyed a glass of Riesling. The list is small, and nothing particularly eye catching... but they do cover all of their bases with a wide range of deep reds and light, fruity whites. I was particularly excited to see that they serve New Age!

The previous online version was pretty crappy too, but this new version is even worse!  I suppose it is supposed to be an improvement but believe me it is not!  The new version has too much flash in it and makes it very unstable.  It is not easy to navigate and due to the excessive flash, you have to wait too long for everything to load.  And the errors!

What a freaking joke for a paper -  both the print and online editions.",2
9854,3,1548460800000,"My husband told me to refrain from reviewing this establishment until I either slept on it or visited the store again to validate my experience. Fortunately for me, I did.

First of all, I created this yelp account to specifically review this store. I've visited this store not once, but twice. Both times have proven to me that there is a huge lack of genuine care coming from one of its associates, I found, is the store manager. Mike, I think is his name. 

Anyway, my first time there, I was pretty skeptical about what the company did and made it throughout the entire store, the museum included (which is more laughable than enjoyable), without knowing a single thing about the place. I figured it out, shortly, on my own. One of the wonderful employees there, I can't remember his name, was so friendly and got my friend and I hooked on the idea right away. He helped my friend set up an account, and gave her a quick overview of how to get through the beginning stages of uploading photos. We asked him about how long it'd take for us to go through the process, and he was very honest with telling us it's different for everyone and that the internet was being a little slow that day. Luckily, we had nothing but time to kill. Sadly, he did have to excuse himself for break, lunch, whatever the situation, but Carol (my friend) and I figured we'd be in & out within an hour, at most. That ended up not being the case.

About 10-15 minutes in, we noticed the internet was processing at a much slower speed than we anticipated. Still, we tried to remain positive, but needed assistance once we realized we forgot to add a photo (our mistake). We looked around for an available associate and one girl was assisting another couple and it seemed the only available associate, Mike, was too busy texting on his phone. Carol eventually called out to him and asked for his assistance. Once he came over, he was very condescending with talking us through the steps and seemed aggravated that we even asked for help. His answers were quick and he didn't engage in much conversation. At one point, he asked us if we were looking to get a shadowbox and after we kindly said no, he proceeded to grab one, tell us all about it, and upsell it to us. Carol and I both come from a strong sales-driven background and his methods seemed almost like he was attacking us. We didn't need a shadowbox, let alone his annoying upselling tactics. 

Although the experience started off great once we sat down, Mike ended up skewing that.

A few days ago, another friend of mine and I decided to visit Polaroid Fotobar. I immediately thought of my less-than-ok experience from my first visit, but thought that since it had been a few months, maybe they improved. I, unfortunately, was wrong.

They did begin a new metal art process, so that was surprising. My friend was so into it and wanted to get a metal print, right away. Once we sat down, we were advised to brighten up the photo to a comfortable lighting as once it's pressed, it darkens. We have no experience with metal photo prints and their processing, but were glad that someone advised us right away of what needed to be done in order for the photo to print out to our liking. 

This time, the customer service was much better as Mike wasn't the associate assisting us. I was even delighted to see he wasn't on the sales floor. That was short-lived once we came back to pick up the photo. The photo was pressed and heavily darkened and even though we were told this could potentially happen, we were most upset at the fact that Mike told us that it's okay and that it looks great. Because it didn't. You could clearly tell he didn't want to refund us or reprint the photo. He insisted the quality was up to par, that there was nothing wrong with it, and even suggested it was our fault that we didn't lighten it up enough.

I want to rate this establishment at least 4 stars for the few employees that gave great customer service the 2 times I visited, but unfortunately, Mike has ruined each experience in a number of ways.

I'm a businesswoman, and my friends are either in hospitality or customer service careers and we're so disappointed that one person can ruin an experience that's supposed to provide lasting memories. My niece has even had an awful experience and would rather order online through a different company and pay the extra shipping fee than even deal with their online store, assuming their customer service is the same, digitally.

The store manager, as young as he is, ought to learn how to be a store manager, especially in a location that thrives off of travelers. He displayed no sense of genuity, care, sensibility, humbleness, nothing. If I were to ever respond condescendingly to any guest, in a position such as a store manager, I'd be worried for days, wondering if that guest would write ill of me. 

So here I am and hopefully this will be a lesson learned.",2

I'm extremely glad that my wife and I decided to go tonight. Our server Paul was on his game. It's like he could read my mind and replenish my drink or fries before I asked. The restaurant also has a kiosk at each table to order, get more drink, pay the bill, ask for the server. It was great. I ordered the buzz mac and cheese burger. Two patties with mac and cheese between them. I live mac and cheese and the idea for this burger was great. McDonalds Big Mac has nothing on these all beef patties. My wife ordered the Caesar salad w/ clam chowder and garlic bread. She said the salad was so good that Caesar Augustus probably made it himself. Clam chowder was on fleek and garlic bread was delicious.",1

My friend and I shared one of the mango desserts with sago and it was great. We also got a dish with ice cream, tapioca, popping boba and grass jelly. I like popping boba in my frozen yogurt but it just did not go with the other things in this dish ... Might just be my taste, although my friend did think the same.

Overall the dessert selection looked really good and other customers' desserts looked quite appetising.

The staff here are really casual ... Almost too casual. When we entered, we couldn't tell who worked here and who didn't. After we ordered our first dessert we wanted the menu again to order more, and after we finally got someone's attention, she looked like a deer in headlights and really unsure of what to do. (Just come over to our table first instead of standing there and then we can tell you what we want from you!)

I'm not usually picky about service but it was kinda annoying here. I will probably still come back here to try more of their menu, though.",1

We also requested the newly renovated tower, which according to them we got after the 40 minute search, only to find that the carpet is all torn up, the chair is absolutely filthy and we found a dog toy stuffed into the sheets of the bed, which means they did not change the sheets from the last visitors.

""Martini Time"" is a live-audience cooking demonstration that is a lot more than just ""hey look at me cook up a steak.""  Chef Tina Martini imparts her many years and experience as a chef and nutritionist on the audience during the one-hour show.  She explains all of her ingredients, the health benefits of each and why they're an important part of a balanced diet.

She then shows off her culinary skills without skipping a beat on her presentation quality, which could easily fit in on Food Network.  The audience is fully involved and gets to eat the dish as they watch Tina put it together.  There's plenty of time for Q&A at the end.

Chef Tina is just getting started at M Resort and I was lucky enough to get a free pass the M Resort gave away via Twitter.  Tina does three shows a day, ranging in price from $40 to $60 dollars.  Sounds pricey, but keep in mind that also gets you a pass to the excellent M Resort buffet after the show with VIP seating.

And yes, Chef Tina Martini holds true to her name.  The show starts with a free martini called the M Fantasy which is super good.  You can even eat the flower garnish.  I only wish M Resort would have launched this show a couple months back when it was getting all kinds of publicity from hosting the latest Top Chef season.",3

The sandwich was good, but believe me, this was not the canters I love on fairfax.  The pastrami was second rate to the original and definitely benefited from the swiss and dressing.  The menu's pretty limited, but the potato salad was great and the prices were about the same (albeit for less meat).

I spend my time working on the business as oppose to in the business, which means I need a place to get work done away from the staff.  I joined CO+HOOTS as both a workspace, as well as a place to meet others who I can share ideas with and gain energy from.
 
Since joining my productivity has greatly increased.  Having a place where I can go outside of my home and hair shops keeps me focused and on task.  For example, when I am at CO+HOOTS there is much less temptation to take a ""Game of Thrones"" break (or marathon) in the middle of my work day.

Its been more than just a workspace though.  For example, I have attended several free events they set up for members to share their talents with other members.  The last couple weeks I attended two sessions on improving your social marketing that have really helped me.

Lastly, but not leastly, it's a wonderful community of people.  I have met many other professionals who are in a similar start up or small business sphere that I am.  Being able to share ideas has been both energizing for me and helpful to both myself and others I collaborated with.",2

Cost for two was close to a hundred bucks, but we ordered ala carte and were hungry.  The oyster selection is among the best available locally.  Price for 6 range from $11-16 - again on the high side of prices.  Service was quick and efficient.   Fried clams were OK, but not the best.  Lobster bisque was tasty, but not a lot of lobster chunks in it.  Sushi was OK, but not great.  I'd rank the sushi as a 6/10, but I'm pretty picky when it comes to sushi.  Everything tasted great.

When I moved to Henderson, my eyebrows had completely faded so I started looking for a permanent makeup artist. Finally, after being here for almost a year, I found Sophia! Permanent makeup is a scary thing because if the artist doesn't do it right you are stuck!! I went in to Laguna Spa and met with Sophia. She was just finishing up with a client and I was able to see Sophia's work first-hand. Her client's eyebrows were perfect! I immediately knew I had found my new permanent makeup artist.

We also ordered the hot n sour soup, which - vegetarians beware - is generously filled with not just tofu, but shrimp and pork as well. Not a pork eater myself, I'll have to take my cohort's word for it that it was equally delicious. Meals were reasonably priced, especially the chef's specials. Service was fine - quite attentive, actually.

Each of us shared a taste with eachother and the range of flavors was astounding. Anyone could find something that they will really enjoy. 

The chef made a point to personally introduce himself to us and was able to give us recommendations straight from the kitchen. 

Plus, the service was great. Our server brought us a tasting of beers when we couldn't make an educated decision about which microbrew we would prefer. She tried tempting us with a chocolate mousse cake and a caramelized banana sundae but we were too stuffed. I can satisfy my sweet tooth Saturday while I indulge in the live music.

Served in a tidy takeout container, coated cardboard so the soy sauce floats around on the bottom. I've had the chicken a couple times and it is so good I can't seem to get myself to go back to their special featuring the purple rice. A five piece box of juicy morsels coated in a crunchy layer for 12 bucks? Truly a jewel of a stop on busy Queen Street. 
They coat the chicken in a squirt of mayo when you order, which adds to the juiciness, but feel free to ask them to leave it off. The soy sauce goes great on it! I haven't asked for any other garnishes but I imagine they might have other goodies behind the counter.
I call the place it's in, a loser mall, because everyone knows what I mean. Especially OCAD students as it's in their backyard. A little bit of heaven of a jerk spot is in the very back of the long empty dark and very dingy aisle, and before the smells of the Caribbean awaken your senses, is where the great Japanese god Gushi resides.

My most recent trip we sat at the bar for the first time and had a great experience. The bartender, Jay, was super friendly and attentive. We ordered the garbanzo beans, the cheese & fruit plate, and the crispy potatoes. All great choices for tapas! (The potatoes actually aren't crispy, but they are still good!) A pitcher of sangria and the rum cake made for a full meal (we were stuffed with this amount of food!)

Here are my tips:

Must have: Red Sangria! The pitcher is our go-to and really is delicious!

Consider: My favorite meal is the chicken cannelloni, the Spanish rice & veggies (that come with every entree) is great! Dessert: you can't go wrong - but I never have room for it! Tapas: the cheese and fruit plate is sizeable, be sure you have enough people to tackle it!

The patio is lovely - even through the fall it's a great outdoor area for dinner! They have the patio, a few areas of dining rooms, and the front bar area - so all people can find a place to please them!

At the end of every meal they give you a shot of almond liquor - enjoy!

Sure, the pull out couches feel like we're sleeping on bricks but where else can you get a two bedroom suite that has two king beds, two pull out couches, and a lounging chair that can be used as a bed. 

This place is budget friendly, perfect for those early 20 somethings that just want a place to crash with a group of their friends. 

This used to be Planet Hollywood Westgate and everything is the same except the name. 

The mile shops are convenient for a quick bite at Earls, Panda Express, Pinky hot dogs etc or to pick up drinks for pregaming at Fat Tuesdays, ABC stores, or the other nearby bars. But to be honest, that mile back to the room after a long night at the club really wears me out... 

Sucks that we have to pay for wifi. 

Overall, the number of sleeping spots, bar and fridge in the room, projector screens and tvs in all the rooms, a jacuzzi in one of the rooms, and a pool downstairs is a recipe for a good time with good friends.

When I first walked in, the blonde girl with the glasses behind the counter took no notice of me considering it was a such a small space to begin with. She seemed uninterested and didn't want to be there. A simply 'hello' would've been nice.

I'd decided on 2 plain butter tarts, I think the price was $2.75 per tart. Brought them home and got my cup of coffee ready and was super excited, I love butter tarts. I noticed that the tarts were oozing something (probably excessive sugar), it was really sticky, which is a mess to clean afterwards, ugh. The tarts themselves was really good and really sweet. If you have a sweet tooth? this is for you. The crust was also good, nice and flaky, though I would've prefer more butter or a tough of salt in the crust to contrast the sweetness of the tart. Nonetheless, good tasting tarts. However, what I didn't enjoy was the sticky and chewiness of some parts around the edges (I'm guessing it's the caramelizing of the sugar). It was no enjoyable and made for a very sticky cleanup. Also, it got suck in my teeth numerous times.

I left with one shampooed mat and with a car that smelled horrible (it smelled as if they used dirty, mildew towels to wash the inside of my car). I gave them the benefit of the doubt and hoped the smell would go away within a day; I even left my windows cracked overnight only to have that smell continue the next day so I brought my car back and asked them to correct the smell. Apparently they didn't realize the other mat was soaked and needed to be shampooed (although I asked to have both mats shampooed) and at no time during their service did they think to shampoo the soaked mat or ask if I wanted it shampooed. I am now stuck with a $100 bill for them to sanitize and shampoo my ""carpets"". It is very shocking that no one realized the carpets needed to be shampooed during the first car wash. Subpar service and very disappointing!",2

Then you see they have a great choice of sandwiches and salads, which are wonderful.  I had the BLT essentially, but they have a way cuter name for it.  Anyway, it is FULL of bacon, and a heavenly little thing called bacon jam (see my review of Honey Salt another place which supplies this wonderful condiment).  I had a latte which was awesome, and then we checked out their baked goods.  I had a loving v. virginia which is the legalization of marriage between a cookie and a brownie.  It was such a cute name I HAD to get it and it was worth the $3.95, although being a bit of a baker myself I think it could have been cooked a little less.  Now, the only reason it is not getting five stars is that there is not too many tables, but here's the thing, it's a CENTER and probably not meant to be a restaurant, but that's ok!

Why would you have a major airline at the furthest possible position, both ticketing and baggage? What did American Airlines do to deserve this? Security is not that much different than a slaughter house line. At least it's usually quick.

Parking is probably close to the best of any airport I've had to deal with, so there's that. Prices are definitely the cheapest.

My first experience with them wasn't really anything special. I do enjoy the fact that they make the burgers the way you want them too, but the ingredients going into the burger is nothing special.

Also, the way they stack the burger is what kills it for me. By putting the mushrooms and onions on the bottom of the double patties, it kind of melts the bottom bun, which was a big bummer for me. The meat wasn't spiced at all, but tasted fresh, which gives them some points. 

As for the potatoes, I don't really care where they come from, so having a sign to tell us where they come from seems kind of pointless. We got the Cajun spiced fries, which the wife didn't enjoy, but I liked. 

They tasted frozen though, which was kind of a let down.  EDIT: Just found out they always use fresh potatoes...didn't taste fresh.

Other than that, you do get plenty of food for the price, and the decor is nice. Staff was great.

I even find that the chips here taste better some how. And now you can even find the same brands in the grocery store here in both salty and sweet treats. Why pay more else where if its available here.

10095,1,1548547200000,"Get ready to give your dollars a big kiss goodbye at Lil' Baci. A few friends and I were seduced by the sexy look of this place - the high ceilings, the art on the walls, the mirrors, the nice bar up front. But as the saying goes beauty is only skin deep and you can't eat a table or chair. We started with the duck meatballs and the house salad. The meatballs were good and worked well with the cream sauce, but the salad was only meh. For me, the best part of the meal was the rustic bread that was served. 

The pizza however was a total train wreck. I ordered the fungi pizza and at $18 a pop I expected it to laden with all sorts of delicious mushrooms. Unfortunately it was a massive let down. I wouldn't even call it a pizza. The cremini mushrooms were soggy and lacked any real substance or flavour, and didn't work well with the tangy taleggio cheese or truffle oil. The pizza crust however was the real monstrosity. I wouldn't even honour it by calling it pizza. It was more like a puffed up pita. Totally lacking any texture, density or taste that you would expect from a normal pizza. It actually reminded me of the puffy pita bread they serve you at Paramount, which works well with Middle Eastern food, but not so much with Italian. I could barely choke it all down.

My friends were happy with their pasta and pizza dishes, but they're the type who are happy with pretty much anything put before them. They were kind enough to treat me to dinner, but I felt bad that they had to shell out $109 before taxes for pig slop.",2

As one who's not usually a fan of fruit in my main courses, I was blown away by the thin slices of green apple in the chicken salad. It's just enough to take the salad to the next level. Their simple greens salad is just that, simple but refreshing. Their tomato soup is out of this world. They garnish it with a piece of baked mozzarella, to die for!

10169,3,1547596800000,"There really aren't many breakfast spots on the east side of Vegas. Which is where I live. I love heading downtown, but sometimes I'm not up for wondering to far from home. That's why I dig Bonanza lounge! Bonanza lounge is a bar with an attached restaurant. You can sit in the restaurant or at the bar to order food. 
The menu is not just for breakfast, but they have great choices for lunch and dinner too! As far as breakfast goes I usually get the half order of biscuits and gravy which comes with a sausage link. This is more then enough food for me, but the regular order would feed a normal person. The gravy isn't greasy and has chunks of sausage in it. You can tell it's definitely home made. I've also tried a couple of their omelettes too. All huge and very well cooked. For lunch or dinner they have an awesome burger! There are several options of burgers the BBQ burger and the one with guacamole are my favorite. My top item to order has to be the BBQ chicken sandwich. The chicken is always moist and not dried out. Even though the BBQ sauce isn't home made it's still tasty. Bonanza lounge also has some crispy fries that are delicious. 
The staff at Bonanza Lounge are friendly and always remember me. Which makes it nice when they just bring me the to go container and I don't have to ask. The prices are very reasonable for what you get. Example this morning- I ordered a half order of biscuits & gravy and a cup of coffee for only $5.41! Sweet deal! 
If you live on the east side definitely swing by Bonanza Lounge for breakfast, lunch or dinner.",2

10183,2,1548201600000,"I've been going here quite a bit lately since I moved back to Scarborough and I must say it does the trick when your hungry. I have to say I've definitely had better Indian food for some reason the taste does seen rather bland for authentic Indian cuisine  I think the chiefs play it safe with the level of spice. Most dishes are delicious it just seems like something is missing for it to be considered real great Indian cuisine. I do not know enough about how to cook Indian food to say exactly what it is. I like the fact that the dishes are not salty, the only time I feel bad from the food is when I eat to much. The tandoori although good seems a little short on flavor, small pieces the butter chicken is quite disappointing it is very rich and doesn't taste 
like butter chicken I remember from other restaurants, not to mention it has bones in it what a sin. There always seems to be more sauce than chicken.The pieces I thought were quite small. The beef dish is good, the curry goat and chicken not so much the meat on these dishes seems very tough, I think they use the cheapest meat for the buffet. I haven't  tried the dishes on the menu yet bet I assume they are allot better. The veggie dishes seem old like they've been sitting their for days, overall the buffet does not seem to heat the food I have never seen the dishes really hot there not cold just lukewarm. The only hot item is when they bring the Nan bread from the oven. I really wish they had more of those famous  Indian
deserts, instead of ice cream which I don't think is sanitary to leave it there and everybody dig in to it and they need to cover it separately as well not just the door. The service unfortunately is not that great either the owner is very friendly, however the waiters seem disengaged like they just want to go home, no small talk no smile nothing. The worst thing for me about being served in a restaurant is when I have to ask for EVERYTHING, I don't mind sometimes but I always have to ask for another drink, more water, napkins remove bottles etc. every single time. The place does give the appearance of being clean especially the washrooms which is one of the reasons I go back. I must say I have seen attitude from some of the staff again not the owner who is always professional. On one occasion a girl working there who I never seen  before or ever since actually spoke rather rudely to me in an unfriendly tone for putting a little sauce back on the buffet dish from my plate OMG Call the police lol. Last thing I want to address is the decor definitely needs an upgrade seating could be set up better to maximize space, the carpet looks old and decrepit and the T.V looks nice but I've never seen it on. I don't think they want to pay for cable and no clock, whats up with that, oh I get it don't let people know what time it is so they won't leave to soon or have another beverage. The thing I hate about the buffet section is there is no light I think it should be the other way around lots of light to see the buffet and less light in the dinning room perhaps candles would make for a better dinning experience, flowers would create ambience, sometimes the music is too loud for dinning.  I think rather than everybody so close to each other in the dinning room they should use the other room as well especially on the weekends where seating is an issue. One more thing, through the week business is petty slow sometimes only me and a few people are there.So why play games with the few customers you have, one time a waiter who is no longer there charged me imported price for domestic beer I brought it to the owner's attention and he adjusted the bill the next time I went, no apologies were given everybody know's Budweiser is domestic duh. Another time I specifically asked for a Canada Dry Ginger Ale and that's the name it is listed as on the menu, the owner brings it to me and life is good. The next one I ordered he brings no name ginger ale I was so angry I just left as soon as I finished the meal I didn't want to lose it. Ant the no name of course tastes like crap that's why its cheap but he still charged me the $2.50. One time the said waiter who is no longer there when I asked him to remove the bottles from the table, he said you have a big table with lots of room. What the hell is he talking to me like that for. Unbelievable this is not how you talk to customers who pay your bills. As you can imagine it was reflected in the tip. Another time they tried to give me a bottle of beer that was opened for days flat as hell, they corrected that when I  spoke up about it.
Look I'm not saying to avoid this place at all, I just know they could make it a whole lot better.
I usually go alone and I've noticed the more people the better the service.(the  bigger the tip) By all means check it out the buffet used to be $10.95 they just raised it to $14.95 but the buffet items did not change at all, nothing new added go figure.",2

10248,1,1547424000000,"Somebody please explain to me why Nikki H's review is on top - it's nearly 4 years old, and she was clearly clueless. Totally useless review. Ignore her.

First of all, if you are not a Bruce Campbell fan or have never seen the Evil Dead movies, why the sweet flaming hell are you coming to this show? That's like going to see Star Wars and complaining because you don't like science fiction. Or fantasy. Or movies.

This show is a cult classic for a reason. It's cheesy, yes, because that's the point! If you listen to the lyrics, it's even funnier. People pay extra to sit in the splatter zone for the experience. If you don't want to get wet, don't pay extra and don't sit there. Duh.

Chris, playing Ash, out-Campbells Bruce himself. Handsome, hot as hell, and hilarious.

Jim, playing Good Old Reliable Jake, nails it. Campy? God yes. Like a cartoon! Fun! He can really sing, too.

The girl who plays Annie (Shelley in the First scene) has an incredible voice and is quite versatile. I didn't even know it was the same girl until the end, lol.

They have beefed up the choreography since the last time I saw the show. They also have an ""S-Mart"" in the lobby now if you want to buy souvenirs. You will still get free pics with the cast.

The show rocked. 

The venue needs help. Drinks are so expensive and tiny they aren't worth it. The show before ALWAYS runs long, which means we have to wait in line 30-60 minutes while they clear out (rude!) - another reason to ignore Whiny McClueless's review - late starts have nothing to do with them.

UPDATE: I hear they have moved venues. Worth finding them again.",2
10257,1,1546560000000,"While I've never experienced the need to hide my change that Eric has, I have unfortunately experienced the disgustingly inflated gas prices here.  I assume that the hike is due to this establishment's location off the highway, but it is seriously at least 10 cents more expensive than other gas stations.  Unless your car is on E, avoid this place.  And even if it is on E, it might be more worthwhile to push your car to the next closest gas station.",3
10259,3,1547942400000,"My friends and I had been frequenters of the former Maharaja for years. Found out it changed hands and became Tandoori House so we went over Friday afternoon to give the lunch buffet a try. Arrived around 1, the place was pretty empty. Think there was only 1 other table seated the entire time we were there. And once we tried the food itself, we knew why.

The selection was pretty standard to what you'd expect at one of these buffets. I of course got some tikka masala, my go to, and tried the lamb curry, and a few other things I cannot recall the name of. I took my first bite of the tikka, and spit it out. It was like taking a shot of salt. Everyone else did the same. It was inedible. At least 3 of the other dishes were just the same, the only flavor was salt. Overpowering loads of salt. And on top of that, they had the heater on the buffet set really low or even off, if they food had been any cooler I wouldn't have even tried it, for sanitary reasons. One of the managers stopped by to ask  how the food was at one point, and I was honest with him. He did offer to have a batch of ""low sodium"" tikka misala made up, which came out piping hot. And while it certainly wasn't the salt bomb that the stuff on the buffet was, it was completely bland.

It seems a strange turn around from the ""wasn't salty enough"" comment here from 2 months ago. And I know the business is still new, but you'd think they'd have the recipes in tip top shape after 2-3 months.",2

This place is open late, it always seems to be busy and has 20+ flavours of delicious gelato to choose from. They create their own flavours (the most unique we had was cake batter). 

It's run by a husband and wife team but teenagers man the counters. 

There is both indoor seating as well as an outdoor patio.

Neighborhood is sketchy at best. They're doing some road construction out front, and maybe things will improve when that's done. Or maybe the construction is just to help get people the heck out of here as fast as they can?

The room was clean... ish... Beds were typical Motel 6, tacky comforters and all. There was adequate hot water in the shower, though the fixtures were clearly in need of either replacement or assisted suicide.

My biggest issue with the place is that they plastered all over the online reservation that it had Wi-Fi available, and I actually planned to make use of that while I was here. Turns out the Wi-Fi only works in about 20 of the rooms, and it's not even ""the 20 all at the north end"" or anything sensible like that. It was ""these six over here seem to get it"", and ""a couple of these in the corner can get it"", and ""if you brought some aluminum foil with you, you might be able to get it from that room on the second floor"". If you don't have Wi-Fi, just say that you don't. Having it sort of available in 30% of the rooms, if the weather is good, and the neighbors haven't changed the password on it... yeah...

Cleanish, decent price, so I can't give it a 1. But it sure doesn't deserve anything higher than 2.",2

In addition, they do some catered events too in a back private room which are really nice. 

Things I've liked that I've tried: 
- Thai Pork Pizza (get this!!!! I had this this weekend. So delicious. Juicy pork and interesting flavors from the lemongrass and jalapeno really give this a sweet and subtle kick)
- Banana cream pie. Yummmmmmmmmmmmmm. 
- Cheese curds - yes. just get these. 
- Beer battered bacon and asparagus: a simple way of eating all the things. 
- Bavarian pretzel - I love the cheese sauce!
- Chicken, bacon, blue cheese pizza - also very yummy to try and share! These pizzas are huge. 
- Four cheese bacon mac n cheese: my friend and I enjoyed the flavors and textures of this. This was among the first few things I tried here. Sold on bacon mac and cheese. They love their bacon here. 

I've tried their steak and lobster during their catered events too and this was pretty spot on. Of all the things I'd come back for--it'd probably be the thai pork pizza. Try it out!",2

I really enjoyed the live music portion of the night but the DJ's music was so loud and the bass was so deep that it made it impossible to try to talk to anybody. Not that that was the worst thing because the crowd here is DISGUSTING. According to locals, this is a known hangout for prostitutes and the men that hire them. Unfortunately for the non-prostitute female population that just wants to go out for a nice time, if you go here you'll still be treated like a prostitute. Best to go ANYWHERE ELSE if you'd like to avoid being fondled without consent. I will NEVER set foot in this place ever again.",2
10295,3,1547337600000,"The 1 star is for my salad & lack of Manager service.  The waitress did her job well, her Manager left her unsupported. My friend and I stopped in for lunch yesterday (a Sat). She ordered the BLTT - which she enjoyed. I ordered the blackberry, orange & brie salad. The salad was $8.50 and came out looking like a small side salade. I had anticipated getting a salad as a meal. When I asked the waitress about the size, she said it was because of the quality of ingredients...there were 4 brie triagles of approx 1/2 inch, two 1/2 pieces of orange, 5 blackberries and a tablespoon of walnuts.  And I'm being generous. I understand I'm in a bar & grill ordering a salad - however, these days that doesn't seem to be an issue in most locations. You get a decent salad. Not with this one.

The waitress said she'd send the manager over. My only suggestion that I was going to make was let people know that this isn't a meal size salade - that it's more a small side salad. 

After this initial conversation - we never saw our waitress again. After a good 15 minutes a lady stopped by and asked if we wanted more water and took our plates. We then asked for the bill. The same lady brought the bill. Then our waitress stopped in to pick up the payment and asked if the Manager helped us or took the salad off the bill. (I wasn't looking to not pay, I just wanted them to inform their customers) We said we hadn't seen the Manager - she informed us the lady that took our plates and brought us water was the Manager. She had never said a word to us. Introduced herself or asked any questions. The waitress was stunned and very apologetic. She was a bit at a loss of what to do. 

We left a decent tip for the waitress, It's not her fault that management is clueless and unprofessional.  Won't be back - too many other options.",3

I always get my food to go, so my review is for the food only. I usually order form the to go counter and one time I waited at the bar and had a beer. The bartender was nice but she made it a point to tell me that I could order to-go food from her. I mean, she is a bartender she has her own customers at the bar.

A perfect pho broth has a clarity and lightness to it, heady aromas, full of flavour, but light...you know what I mean? It's that hard-to-achieve balance that makes the perfect pho. The pho here has a dark, heavy broth, initially giving the impression of beef flavour but ultimately falling short. It's like it was flavoured and coloured with soy sauce, giving it saltiness but no significant depth of flavour. Quantity and price were certainly good though. Noodles and beef were plentiful and decent quality. I also had satay chicken skewers and they were very good.",2
10358,2,1546732800000,"So this my free advice/feedback from one business owner to another (trufusion).  I went to your studio for the first time last Friday.  I signed up for your $30 1 month trial membership.  After signing up, I wasn't given a tour or any real introduction to the place.  I had to ask to find the locker room, ask a guest how the lockers worked, then went back to the desk to ask which room to go to, where they said ""just go right and right"".  The girls at the desk are nice but they really lacked the customer service I expected from franchise like this.  As a new yogi, I didn't know the basics like bring your own mat, towel and water.  I couldn't find a water faucet and so I asked about water and bought a bottle for $3.  No problem.  Did the class.  Instructor was great.  Room was hotter than I expected.  I barely got through as the heat bothered me so I had to take a shower to cool down. A guy in the locker room saw me and I asked about the towel situation (I had thought towels were provided like Lifetime, where I'm currently a member too).  He said he'd get me one as it was my first time.  He brought one back and told me I was charged $3 on my credit card.  Okay well this nickel and dime thing is irritating in the beginning.  I would be okay with it if it wasn't my first time and I had no idea how the place worked. Again, no introduction, tour of facilities, nothing when I signed up.

I came back again tonight.  My second time.  This time with a brand new mat, two clean towels and bottle of water.  I was excited to get my stretch on.  When I walked into class as it began, I saw that the room was packed.  I went to the back where there could've been space but two people were content to spread out more than everyone else and wouldn't make eye contact as I stood there and waved.  Irritated, I walked out.  It would have been nice if the instructor had greeted me and said ""hey, let's see if we can fit you in here"".

I went to the desk and asked if the classes were over-capacity like this and they said ""yes, the instructor is popular and this isn't even that busy"".  Well, that was discouraging.  A guest offered to go in the room and try to find space and even she couldn't do anything about it.

As a new customer, this isn't looking good and I'm now looking to go elsewhere. I know I'm one person, but I'm a loyal person and a good customer.  And I have a large influence within my community here in LV.  I know some of the teachers and guests that attend your studio.  I really wanted to like the place.  But the experience has been lacking.  One young gentleman at the front was good at smiling and explaining how the classes can be busy, and how I could come earlier at less busy times.  The two girls were nice but really looked unhappy and gave me that unwelcome feeling, like it was annoying that I was standing there asking these questions.

So I hope this helps you improve your processes.  Will I go back?  I don't know.  There are other studios around and I like to feel welcome wherever I go.  We shall see...",2

But Allô! Mon Coco should not be missed. First and foremost...it's extremely clean. There's also plenty of seating and the service is very friendly. The only glitch that we experienced was that one breakfast was served at least five minutes prior to the other. That said, I would rather receive hot and fresh food then allow one of the entrées sit under hot lights while the other is being prepared.

One of the special omelettes was ordered that contained brie, caramelized apples and bacon. The side of potatoes was a small mountain along with a couple of slices of fresh fruit. Great reviews on said omelette. It was also served with very thick slices of buttered toast and plenty of spreads to slather.

I decided to go all out and order a platter of food that had a little bit of everything: banana/chocolate hazelnut crepe, eggs, potatoes, fresh fruit and bacon. Oh yeah, and it's served with a side of toast as well. Sweet and savory? Yep.

Everything arrived hot, fresh and cooked to order. (I asked for the potatoes to be a bit more well done and they were..without burning 'em!). Great quality on everything. I would absolutely come back here for breakfast or brunch when I'm back in town.

We sat there for about five minutes waiting for the bartender or a waitress to bring them to our table. Again, had to get up to go get them ourselves. My husband ate the mini chimis but not the shredded lettuce and tomato garnish that came with it. I ate the chimis and the garnish. Excruciating stomach cramps are what woke me up on Thursday morning. I was sick until Saturday. My guess is that the shredded lettuce hadn't been washed properly and sat there, probably in a little puddle of water in the bottom of a container, stewing in bacteria, before they put it on the plate.

Every time I write more than 4 per item, they'll only provide me with 4. I understand why they do it but it's annoying. You also have the call them over to change the grill. They won't just do it on their own. The meat taste like a lower end compared to other places I've had. It's more of a place if you want AYCE for a lower price.",2

I haven't tasted them yet, but I can tell from several window shopping visits (they are located in the same shopping center as Sala Thai) and from seeing this company as a vendor at the Party Expo at the JCC today, that their stuff is pretty incredible!  

This is not just dessert, it's art!  Each decadent creation is handmade and unique - made just for the occasion.  I am thinking that if and when the time comes to pick out a wedding cake, this place will definitely be in the running!  Excited to find out more when the time comes!",1
10446,1,1548720000000,We bought the new XJF this summer and it's been in the shop three times because of the computer. The last time they had our car for five days and when my husband picked it up it was dirty and before he made it out of the service drive the radio stopped working. He pulled back in and spoke the the service manager who refused to take the car back and said he could do nothing and that we should call Jaguar of North America. Mind you this is not a cheap car yet when we get it serviced we get Ford's as loaners instead of a comparable car. All though the Ford did work and had way more functioning bells and whistles then the Jag. We also purchased a service that would take any dings out of the rims. We have asked on all three visits to have the rims repaired and guess what they have not been. When taking our other cars in for service at Mercedes we literally get FIVE star service which is what we expected from Jaguar but have yet to see it. I did call Jaguar of North America and they were shocked at the poor customer service coming from this dealership. The service people all are comedians and make rude condescending remarks about their lack of loaner cars and the respected issues with the computers. They should invest their time in fixing the problem. Looking forward to hearing a resolution from JNA since the dealership cannot preform.,2

I had the MangoBerry salad and an Italian Sub combo. I am always a skeptic with fruit in my salad but my taste buds were taken for an incredible ride! I don't think I'll have my salads any other way from now on!

I've been looking for a new groomer for a while now, and I've hung up on a lot of people because they simply have attitude over the phone. She was nice and answered all my questions. Not to mention I couldn't find my dogs shot records so they called my vet and got them faxed. So convenient.

I walk into the place and The front desk girl was the sweetest! The groomer Amber came out and greeted my dog and I. They all were so loving. She asked me how I wanted him cut. I've only ever been to PetSmart and every time I have told them what I wanted I got the exact opposite. So I expressed that to her. She seemed very concerned on how I wanted it and was very sweet. She assured me he would be in good hands and that she will call me when he's ready.

When I go to pick up my dog the first thing I noticed was that my dog was running around with the groomer in the back where he gets cut. He was not on a leash or in a cage. WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVED! PetSmart puts my dog in a cage and when I pick up I can hear him barking and crying and he's just being ignored. And I hate that. So the fact that he was free and he wasn't barking or crying made me so happy. And that sold me on coming back to them. They also give your dog a ""report card"" and it tells you how they did during the visit! So amazing! Love them! Go there! Trust me! They're great!",2

We ate panang curry, pad thai, pad see ew, a soup and a stir fry. Their pad thai is traditional tamarind based which I personally am not used to. Their curry seemed thick but tasty, their soup was sweet when is normally supposed to be sour. They charge close to ab extra $3 to use a credit card.

10484,2,1547510400000,"Words cannot express how much I love Swensons... 5 years ago, I moved to California. I've had 5 Guys Burger. I've had In n' Out (which everyone said I just HAD to try)... But NOTHING comes close to what Swensons offers. 

You've got:

VARIETY. I swear this restaurant must have the most extensive menu I've ever seen, from tater tots, fried zucchini, and peanut butter milk shakes! There really is something for everyone, whether you've got kids, health nuts (like myself) and hardcore meat eaters (like my now-occasional self). A little bit of everything, which is awesome!

THE GALLEY BOY!! The greatest burger I've ever had. The funny thing is, knowing a little bit about how Swensons makes their burgers, I've made them for friends out here in California. At first, they thought it'd be ""weird"" but they always end up loving it. And you know what? As great a cook I'd like to think I am, I'll never come close to making burgers quite as good as Swensons!

EXCLUSIVITY. At least for now. Swensons is very localized, so I know the only way I'll be able to enjoy it is when I'm back home. Although I often feel nostalgic and a tad bit jealous when I read all the facebook updates on friends and family visiting Swensons, I know I have something really great to look forward to. The best things about Ohio? Swensons and Cedar Point!! These are two places I tell everyone they MUST check out.

And, as a side note, I'd say Swensons wins the facebook popularity contest. I can't tell you how often I read about or see photos of Swensons when I log into facebook... As opposed to any other popular burger joint.

The last thing I'll say, for now, is that Swensons brings back wonderful childhood memories of an affordable, quality dining and eating experience. The service is quick, the food is excellent, and you don't need a Yelp review to figure that out for yourself. Who doesn't love a drive-in restaurant? Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",2

Their hostess stand is outside. There were 3 girls there total all talking and scrambling and on an ipad. There weren't any other customers waiting in that area. No one greeted me and I was ignored for several minutes. They kept discussing trying to find people for their table. Still waiting....We finally get greeted and no hello or nothing. We just get asked how many people. I told her. She asked us for our preference for inside or outside and I said inside. Then she said ok, 2 people for inside. I had to correct her it was for 4 people. She was so distracted on that ipad and talking with the other girl she wasn't even paying attention. It was a hassle. 

We got sat and the server was great. He was super friendly and attentive. He explained everything. They have juice at the buffet. It was room temperature so I asked the server if I an get a glass of ice. He came back with my glass of ice and when I received it there was a HUGE clump of dark brown hair all in and around the ice with huge black specks. I called him over and showed him and he said he was going to get me another glass of ice. I saw him go behind the bar, get a new glass and some ice and starts walking towards me with the new glass of ice. He put the glass to his face and turned it all around and he saw something and went back to get me a 3rd glass of ice. I was so turned off by it.

The menu looks enticing overall, even gives one hope, but seems to fall desperately short of combining what promises to be really good combination of flavors. 

Unfortunately the service was just as abysmal. Nice people, sweet, like molasses's about the same speed.

There are so many great places in the Metro Phoenix/Scottsdale Area.  Don't stop, keep on driving or go to Einstein Bagels next door. You will be much happier.",2

Of course it has a million reviews and 5 stars. There is something for every single person on this planet to enjoy. When the worker found out I had never been there, she mentioned that they make over 400 sandwiches. Four. Hundred. Holy. Crap. 
They have tons of vegetarian options, plenty of unique combos and then the basic stuff as well. If theres one thing (okay, theres many) that Adam Richman has taught me, its that the basic dish is the best way to judge a restaurant. Yes, I went with the boring turkey avocado. 
The lady working there recommended a crunchy bread and had my sandwich out to me in less than 3 minutes. First... it was the size of my head. Massive amounts of food is a big plus in my book. 
The sandwich itself was great. Perfect ratio of meat, bread and lettuce. And the avocado was fresh. None of that crazy bottled crap.

Crab Rangoon - 4/5
Edaname - 3/5 - a bit soggy and not salted much
Chicken soup with coconut - 4/5 tasty but not much chicken
Beef Pad see ew - 3/5 - not as tasty as the Rampart location or other Thai places.

We both ordered chicken burritos with cilantro lime rice, black beans, corn salsa, lettuce, cheese, and sour cream. Found burritos very skimpy on the meat and very flavorless.

The cashier usually suggests something. 

While the drive-thru line was packed... It took about 10 minutes for us. To me, that's quick! Considering the amount of people there was before us. We took our burgers to the park and ate there. I felt like the fries were extremely soggy and that my turkey burger was very sloppy.

Cons: Rooms are what you pay for. Pillows are terrible. Rooms starting to show wear. Off the strip, staff appear to hate their jobs, pool isn't heated, a ton of kids (could be pro or con depending on you), but for a couple in their mid 20's, the pool was a circus. Subpar gaming. Lack of any good restaurants. My room had a keurig without any k-cups. You can purchase single k cups in the lobby for an absurd amount of money. And you are given two styrofoam coffee cups wrapped in plastic. They will charge you $3.50 for each cup that goes missing. $4 water bottles in room (typical). Oh and although its cheap, this place has $18 resort fees per day and you are charged a deposit for each night. For example, I'm here 3 nights and I was charged $90 in deposits alone. This is Because they bank on you taking the water, coffee, use the Internet, and need to be able to nickel and dime you. Be aware. 

I won't be staying here again. It's definitely worth a little extra to stay at a nice hotel, even on the strip.",2
10585,1,1548028800000,"Checked this place out on a Sunday night with a friend from college, and a co-resident.  

Food (8.0/10) = started off with the Jamaican jerk chicken wing appetizers.  When I go back to kaya, this is all I'm going to order.  Absolutely loved it.  The cilantro cream sauce is the best.  I was scraping the plate with the edge of my knife trying to get every ounce of that sauce.  If I wasn't dining with my friends, I would've licked the plate clean like a dog.  Also ordered the fish tacos since it was the most mentioned item on yelp.  The fish itself was nicely done.  Tilapia.  Crispy.  Moist.  Soft.  The only thing weird about the flavor profile was the thousand island dressing in the taco.   It wasn't bad...just felt out of place?  The quantity was a bit overboard as well.  3 big tacos on a platter for $17.  Two tacos would've been just perfect.  This seems to be a recurring formula for restaurant success in Pittsburgh = large quantities of food per order (other examples:  Pamela's, Church Brew).  

Ambiance (7.0/10) = we sat outside.  Strip district is really dead at night.  First time I visited the strip at night.  The surroundings felt like a post-apocalyptic movie, such as I am Legend with Will Smith.

Service (7.5/10) = felt a little awkward whenever our waitress interacted with us.  Not sure what it was.  She was still nice though.  

Overall opinion = fish tacos (most mentioned item on Yelp) is done well by the folks at Kaya, but that thousand island dressing...it bothers me.  If you haven't had it, I'd still try it out.  The real winner, the gold medalist, the award winning dish of Kaya has to be the Jamaican Jerk Chicken wings.  The skin is crispy.  The wings are juicy.  And that amazing cilantro cream sauce!  The folks at Kaya should consider opening up a small wings shop in Oakland, just selling this one dish and beer.  The college kids would eat this up.",2

Located in a lower level of The Bellagio, they do offer outside seating by the water - great to watch the fountains!  The rest of the interior is elegant and somewhat dark - although lite well enough to see menus without a flashlight app!

They give you a bread basket with a few different types of bread in it, all of them were good, but the best was this little muffin with blue cornmeal in it.  I could have ate about a dozen of those alone.  

For an entree I had the 16 spice chicken, it came pretty much deboned, minus one of the wings, over some mashed potatoes.  The dinner version of this was $36, but I would still say it was worth it.

One big tip: the spicy flavoured olive oil condiment honestly made my Nona's pizza taste acceptable, as it was traditional stone baked pizza but soooo thin it flopped when held to eat.  The service was VERY friendly and hospitable while being comforting and attentive. The tiramisu dessert was longing on flavour, heavy on lady fingers and missing mascarpone. It was a fail for us, disappointed as they highlighted this dessert as the best.

Overall, there are better Italian style restaurants in Mississauga. After all, the food flavour is what draws all yelpers back to a restaurant.",2

I love Dunkin' Donuts coffee, and this location is no exception! When they first opened, they had a real issue with drive-through speed. They seem to have ironed out that issue and now they are pretty on par with the rest of the Dunkin' Donuts locations. Their staff is generally very friendly.",2

I get to the window when I'm told its a six minute wait on my spicy chicken sandwich. I finally get my food and the order is wrong all I ordered was a spicy chicken with no tomato and a chili with cheese. Tomato on the sandwich and no cheese in the chili. I've given this place several chances but the service seems to be worse everytime. The owner and managers should be embarrassed at the product they are putting out.",3

I am a fan of Joes stuff, and came here today to see what it was all about.  I really wanted to just go to the coffee shop, but after setting foot in here for the first time, I realized how close these two places were in proximity to each other, and decided to go to both!

I stood in line and ordered the hot dog basket and it was tasty.  I also got a drink as well, and really enjoyed my meal here.  I dont know how he does it, but this place is perfection.  Next time my parents come in to town, I'm taking them here.  amazing.",2
10640,1,1547769600000,"I work at Tivoli Village and have been here on three occassions. I really wanted to like it, but it was simply a poor experience each and every time. The decor is confusing; part soda shop, part modern bistro, part old world italian....did a professional designer get paid for this project? The service was completely disorganized; orders came out wrong over and over. I was offered scotch and wine at 11:30am, while dressed in a suit and tie. I know this is Vegas, but really? The menu reads great, but the actual product was underwhelming. Burgers are petite, nearly flavorless, and bare almost no resemblance to those described on the menu. The Southern Fries (sweet potato) were actually pretty good. The highly touted milkshakes are over-priced and just so so. Bottomline: go to In n Out instead, or if your must overpay for a burger, do so at Lbs at RedRock or Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay.",2
10641,2,1547251200000,The salsa - wow!!!! Definitely a great place to have lunch.  I had the lunch chicken fajitas - so good!,2
10644,2,1547164800000,"I came here with my friend today for all you can eat lunch. We don't love all you can eat as we find the quality is much better when it's not, but we were really hungry and talked about doing this for a while.

Originally, we had our hearts set on trying kaka in Markham which recently opened but we found out they didn't do AYCE lunch. We were at Vaughan Mills so we were just gonna head east to Yoshiko at Bathurst and Steeles (my personal fave) but decided to give a new local place a try :)---big regret!

I was kind of unimpressed right off the bat from the menu, I know AYCE lunch menus have less on them than dinner but I just felt like it was lacking something! Very limited side dishes. They did have red tuna rolls though which I haven't seen on many all you can eat lunch menus.

Normally when I go for sushi I order a ridiculous amount of food because I just want everything. In this case, there were only a few things I was even willing to eat.

The miso soup came first, watered down!! So was the thousand island dressing they used in their green salad. 

My friend ordered a nestea (which costed $1.50 extra) we saw the nestea cans but made bets that they'd bring it in a cup- bingo!! They did, and it was watered down. He asked for an actual can and the waitress just walked away to get it, didn't even reply- busted! I ended up sipping on his watered down drink for the rest of the meal.

The rolls were nothing to write home about- I consider myself a dynamite roll connoisseur and this one had the most miniscule amount of shrimp I've ever seen, the spicy tuna was meh, and the California was meh. My friend really didn't like his sushi pizza and I wasn't crazy about my beef teriyaki- too thick pieces and very peppery! Oh and the best part, he tried to order spicy chicken- it was literally chicken pieces cut up and soaked in like Sriracha, totally could have made that at home and saved myself $15 lol!

At the end we decided to wash down our joke of a meal with ice cream but realized they didn't even have dessert on the lunch menu! (it was one of those check off menus) my friend asked the waitress about it and she handed him a small check off menu- all I could think was what the hell, if he didn't ask they would not have offered this- then I thought of all the poor people who never got any dessert with their lunch because they didn't think to ask!!

The dessert is the only thing I give them props for because they brought the ice cream and fried banana AT THE SAME TIME!! Bless.

I really feel bad writing bad reviews but I'm about to get to the best part..

The bills came and my friend and I both had a charge for pop on our bills even though he was the only one that ordered one. They tried to charge me for sipping on his watered down mess! No thank you! They tried to argue it but there was no way in hell I was paying for that- heck if I wanted to order a pop I'd take a diet coke over Nestea anyway!

I usually am very generous with tips but didn't tip amazingly for obvious reasons.

Will NOT go back. Anyone who gave 5 stars either had a completely different experience or does not go for sushi and appreciate it nearly as much as me!!

Me and my boyfriend's one year anniversary is coming up and we're planning on going for fancy expensive sushi downtown to celebrate, it will be like a vacation compared to Masa! The only reason I gave a second star is for the tuna and ice cream!",2
10648,3,1548806400000,"I was kind of iffy because it is located in the mall, and mall food quality seems to plummet ... But ....Oh my goodness!!!  They need to open up a Grimaldis closer to me!! I was super bummed I didn't get to try it in NYC but this is my second best option. If this is how good it is here.... I really missed out because it must be like 8482919 times better on the east coast.

It was Sunday and only a few people were in line and it was obvious a restaurant worker did not show up. The cashier was doing double duty by being the hostess also. I ordered my favorite Vegas breakfast dish which is Steak & eggs, hashbrowns, and sourdough toast. We only waited around 10 minutes to get our food and it was spot on, good service and good food. I love eating at old school restaurants, there is a reason why they've stayed in business for decades, quality food and service.",1
10660,3,1547510400000,"I went here on the 9th & I am so glad we did. The cashier, I believe her name was kailyn was very welcoming. As soon as we walked in, all the employees greeted us. Kailyn went out of her way to ask us if we are first time customers, and walked us through the menu. My husband had the chicken katsu and I had the bun. Both meals were amazing, and portions are large esp for the great price. The food was all nice and freshly made. The workers came around more than once to ask if our meal was okay !  Also Chris, noticed my husbands skyline and saw we were newlyweds & gave us a promo meal for our next visit.  That was very nice of him & all of your staff.  Also, another plus, they do military discount. The decor was also very cute. I cant wait to come back to try more of their delish meals",2
10661,1,1547251200000,Very sub par. Definitely doesn't have turbo tap because it takes forever to get a beer. Also the ticket times are way too long. It shouldn't take 45 minutes to fry some chicken. Overall would not recommend.,1
10661,3,1547856000000,"Will not go back! I tried to cancel massage appt that was made for me by a friend. I was 30 mins. past their cancellation time and they would not cancel appoint. I understand that is policy (even if I didn't know it) but the customer service was atrocious! The person on the other line was a rude and had an attitude.. ""Well that is our policy and there's nothing I can do about it."" If you're in customer service you don't have an attitude with your customer. There's also a way to say things to diffuse the situation. She just made me more agitated. she could have been more sympathetic and say I'm sorry wish there was something I could do...

So, I try to make the best of the situation and figured I'll go and try to relax. The experience doesnt get better! I get to the front desk to check in. Then she tells me that I'm booked for 75 minutes instead of 50. That's another  $80+ for a service I didn't want to begin with. My friend that made the reservation changed the service to 50 mins from 75 immediately after she made the appointment and even had the ladies name who she spoke with. This person was conveniently not there the day we checked in and she made no notes. Again, no let me see what I can do. Or no sincere apology. It was more like, well im sorry but I dont have any notes that you changed your service (said with a stern attitude).  She was more accusational like well if you called then there would be a note. As if her people dont make mistakes.  

So I try to make the most out of the situation again. But the massage was ok. It wasn't bad but it wasn't the best either. I go a couple of times a year and I usually always leave feeling very relaxed. That was not the case this time. The therapist was also unprofessional and just kept talking in the beginning so I couldn't even relax at first.  He commented on my tattoo saying that I must be a rebel. He talked about what he wanted to do as a side job. When I talked about being in Vegas with my husband he said ""oh, so you have to be a good girl"". I didn't know how to respond to any of that so I just tried to answer in one word when he'd ask me a question. He eventually stopped talking and I eventually relaxed a little... and then came the hot stones that he placed on my body. One was directly over my bladder. It made me have to go to the bathroom.  Talk about killing the relaxing vibe.

Needless to say, if you are looking for great front desk customer service and an amazing massage, save a few bucks and go somewhere else.

Oh and did I mention the required 20% tip that no one mentioned when you check in?  You can't even tip according to how you felt the service went. Yeah, that was another great surprise.  I paid $280 for the worst spa experience I've ever had :-(",2

10670,3,1548460800000,"I have to admit, I had probably driven by this place hundreds of times without ever giving it a thought. After all, what kind of authenticity could I expect from a place with such a silly name? Who is this Mr. Chop Chop, and is he the mascot of the restaurant? 

Well, OBVIOUSLY I was a fool. A silly, misguided fool! Whoever Mr. Chop Chop is, I'd definitely want to be his friend. 

We've ordered from them twice and its been consistently flavorful and fast. The boy always gets a red curry when we have thai, and the first time he got a Mongolian beef that he enjoyed. Last time we ordered the curry, spicy mint pork, chicken satay, tom yum kai and crab rangoon. The rangoon was fat with cream cheese and a bit of crab, and the wontons were light and crispy. The curry was spicy and had lots of vegetables with juicy bits of chicken. 

I love tom yum kai and use it as my gauge, and their's was great. It had a definite home-made feel, with big chunks of galangal and lemongrass. The chicken was tender and definitely a lot fresher than some of the other places I've tried. They put strips of jalapeno into the soup and it was definitely spicy! 

The satay came with a peanut sauce and some sweet vinegar pickles that were delicious! A great compliment to the rich peanut sauce. 

The pork was also good, with a medley of vegetables and lots of chunks of fresh garlic. The meat was flavorful without being dense or overly porky, and the mint was a great addition. It made the whole dish taste lighter, fresher and more balanced. 

The delivery was relatively quick, within an hour, and we were very satisfied with the spice level. Most places go easy on it doubting our abilities as caucasians, leaving me to dump chili sauce into it. That was definitely not the case here, my first bite of the tom yum kai was a  shock. So spicy! It was great! I appreciate their generosity with the spice. 

We only got one rice with the meal, but it was enough for the meal. I may need to make a fresh batch for the leftovers, of which there is plenty. We got a ton of food for about $40 with enough for another meal. If we hadn't been so enthusiastic about trying things, we probably could have gotten a third meal out of it. 

Yummy food and close to home, I look forward to trying more of their offerings.",2
10675,3,1547596800000,Cool concept but they got it all wrong. I ordered an iced latte with half and half and a chocolate milk in the drive thru.

Extreme stomach pains 15 minutes later I knew that they had given me milk and not half and half like I had ordered.  Will not be back.,2

There were no lights to eliminate the ATM, creating both a safety issue and necessitating banking using the light of a smart phone. The ATM did not have any envelopes. Customer service is outsourced: you are not able to contact the branch directly unless you have an individual's phone number. Further, the call centre is not able to handle some matters necessitating a transfer back to the branch, a process that took 16 minutes! Does Scotiabank not realize that it has competition?",2

I haven't been inside Peppermint for a while, but the interior has nice decorations and, from what I remember, the staff was always attentive and polite. Their Pad Thai (I think shrimp and chicken comes automatically) is my favorite thing on the menu, and I could probably eat the whole container in one sitting! The beef satay is also very good, well seasoned and gets a bonus point because it's on a stick, and who doesn't love things on sticks? This review is getting long, but Peppermint is so good that the deliciousness of their food can't be explained in words! Definitely try the pad thai, beef satay (the peanut sauce that comes with it is the best sauce I've ever tasted, and it goes well in the pad thai), and if you're in the mood for yummy hot food, try Peppermint!",1

On day 4 of no working AC in triple digit Las Vegas heat, I'm calling the answering service to find out why haven't the tech called and it's 733pm.

He got Michelle and instead of her calling me she's texting from a number I can't even text back. So unprofessional. She's telling me there is nothing to do but wait till the morning and she can call the guy and have him come out. In the mean time my 10 year old chihuahua is panting profusely and My fish are dying. So many have died. And they just gave birth to babies. Me being a black woman and feeling as if she didn't give a damn I threw in the race card. Yes I did.  I have a white friend who is a Chaplin and he told me to use it,  lol. So she's married to a black man & have black kids. (new to me but don't care) I still feel like because I'm a black woman and a section 8 recipient I'm being mistreated. But her response was.  (copy & pasted).......


""Yes they are there waiting on you since you indicated that you were not home today.  As far as you being black I do not give a crap what you are.  And you need to do better. I am married to a black man and have black children.  So check yourself.  Also I can communicate in whatever fashion I would like.  I will check when your lease is expiring and ensure that it is not renewed since you want to be so unprofessional.  Good night. No further response will be provided.  You have the a/c companies contact information. ""    
(who was gonna wait at home and it's 111° outside?)

Then she came back with..... 


""Perfect. I see you are month to month.  I will provide yourself and housing notice to vacate this coming week.  I am not sure what your fish and it dying has to do with you're a/c.  Thank you.""

(mind you, if it's 111° outside it's probably 150° on the inside and the fish are used to it being about 76°) 

So now she wants to evict me because I'm mad at her unprofessionalism. I informed her that I'm saving all correspondence between the two of us and I will be contacting legal services my attorney as well as my caseworker.  Also Larry the AC guy, not knowing anything about the conversation, finally calls at about 930pm and asked how soon can I be home because they are finally ready to get it fixed.  So I called Michelle a liar and told her that they are finally at my condo. It is now 11:30pm and I'm sitting in my car waiting for them to finish because it is stifling inside the condo.

Our favorite was the New York roll and the calamari tempura roll, which we new to us. They're not stingy with spicy mayo or ginger, which is actually really important to me. The ambience inside is nice, and the spot is clean as well. They seem to have a lot of repeat customers because you can save your chopsticks on a shelf for next time.

The bacon was overcooked and almost burnt to crisp, which I liked..but some people like their bacon soft.  Cant really complain about any of the entrees, it wasnt spectacular and wasnt bad...I dont think its anything to die for.

Since I moved over here in the state I was locking for authentic food like that.

I am from Middle East and I can recommend that with close eyes .
They gave a small tiny modern. Kick to the traditional food without any compromise In taste 
Consider it as  chipotle for middle eastern food but very  authentic 

 I do recommend humus sharwerma bowl with some fried eggplant . I tried it wit tahini , I would say try it better with Greek zasiki. 

My wife had chicken shawarma and was great also 


I will write this review in different languages since I love both food and languages ;) lol

Para empezar soy Árabe y me gusta comer todo. Este lugar fantástico y muy original . El pan es fresco hecho adentro y tiene blanco y integral. A mi me gusta el segundo mas. Es mi fijo parece hasta una tortilla mexicana grande. Pero sabe diferente .

El humus es fresco hecho en casa y también la shawarma    ( el pincho redondo de pollo y carne ) 
La gente son amable y muy servicial . Hasta John el americano blanco habla español ( mi respeto John ) ere súper amable .

Usted puede compartir tal vez el plato mezclado con su pareja porque son generosos y servían  bastante .

Highlight of the menu is the grilled calarmari appetizer. Tender, well charred, and perfectly seasoned. This was the first truly successful grilled calamari I have had (albiet, it was a couple years ago - I consistently order this same appetizer). Pastas are nicely done as well. 

I've been here at least 5 times in the last 18 months and the menu has not changed. I am fine if that means there is a focus on execution and maintaining quality, but I realize some of you out there are looking for seasonal cuisine - this is not the spot for you. Their website does claim they are moving toward a more seasonally focused menu though.

10759,3,1546300800000,"Worst experience of my entire life with a car rental company. I booked with this company over the phone and the customer service agent quoted me one price. I get to the counter and they charge $100+ on top of what the agent quoted me saying it was in the terms and conditions. Agent never informed me of all the charges that were added to the price. I try and speak with a customer service agent and wait 20+ min. I finally speak to someone who claimed he was a manager and gave me discounts but he ended up transferring me to another agent because I didn't want to downgrade the car I wanted. The next agent I spoke to said the agent before her was NOT a manager and had no power or business giving me anything. I asked to be transferred to a manager and had to wait another 15+ min for a woman to tell me she had no record of me speaking with any of the previous people, there was nothing she could do for me and then hung up on me. Is this how they treat their customers?? By lying, giving false promises, and having agents that are completely rude. These calls are supposed to be recorded. They will be reported to the BBB. They should have a record of everything that was said and promised. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE WITH YOUR MONEY!! You can find better deals elsewhere believe me!",2

I had my usual order with a shredded pork soft taco, shrimp tempura soft taco, and a corizo/egg/cheese breakfast taco.  The main ingredients, pork, shrimp, and chorizo and egg were as I remembered, cooked just right and very flavorful.  That's where the similarity ends, the fresh tortillas I remember were either leftovers or have been replaced with mass produced.  The toppings that should be a perfect mix of lettuce, feta, cilantro, sauce, etc. were reduced to 99% lettuce and added nothing to the tacos.

The second star is earned only for the fact that the hot sauce hasn't changed, (it's fantastic but I should have bought a bottle so I wouldn't have to go back there again) and it appeared they still serve beer in the frosted goblet (although it was lunchtime and I had to go back to work so I did not partake).

The wings came out...took about 20 minutes which is fine.  Cook my chicken completely please.  Well they came out and OMG soooo hard.  It was like they used old oil.  The waitress returned and I said these wings aren't right.  She said ok do you want us to remake them or would you like something else.  I said please remake.  Another 25 minutes go by with the excuse of they are rechanging the oil so it takes awhile to heat up.  OK...no problem.  Finally the wings come out and I admit they did look better but the first bite, clearly they were either A) the same wings or B) whoever was cooking that day did not know how to make the wings because they were hard, dry and the breading was soooo hard to bite into, even with the sauce.

The heated room was the perfect temperature for hot yoga as well! 

What I like the best are the change rooms. There's plenty of space but bring your own lock! The showers have the rain shower heads and there are shampoo/conditioner and body soap available in each stall. Super refreshing after a hot class.

The burger is bland and if you're lucky (note my sarcasm), you'll get a few nice, chewy chunks of fat in there. I got some kind of s'mores dessert and it was a cheap mess. How can you make a bad s'mores dessert??? It's cruel! Their menu is so awesome, but they're SUCH a tease! They cannot execute anything well. I gave them two stars: one, for the selection in the menu and the other, because I haven't had any beer here and it is kind of a brewery I guess so I can't judge them there. Also, people seem to like their deep-fried bacon, but I personally cannot bring myself to put something like that in my body, but then again I did eat at Destihl TWICE *facepalm*

--I had the General Tso's Lunch Special w/ white rice and egg roll.  Eat-in--

Rice is nice.  Their's was not over/under done, appropriately chewy, and clean tasting.

The egg rolls were ""blah"", but they weren't greasy like you sometimes find.

The General Tso's was excellent:  

Sauce - I was pleased when they brought it out and sauce was not the ""Red General Tso's Sauce.""  I don't have anything against the Red General, but their sauce was bright tasting, balanced, sweet, and had just about the right hint of zip.  

Fried Chicken - crisp and ""clean oil fried"" (if that makes sense?), not soggy or overly battered.  The chicken bits were bite size, and fit comfortably on the fork.

Portion size - Appropriate for lunch.  The plate was full, but not piled on like they're trying to make up for any lacking qualities in the food by providing volume.

Overall, I will definitely be going back here to try some of their other dishes.  The wait time was appropriate, the food was fresh tasting.  I like soda pop.

10854,3,1547078400000,"To begin - TO FIND THIS PLACE, LOOK FOR THE NOSE. 

Some background - I am visiting Toronto from the Northern Virginia area, and I was not eating meat from Monday through Wednesday, so this Thursday dinner, I was looking forward to this meal.  

So I hadn't planned this meal, and I called a friend in the states to look up something on yelp, but since he wasn't sure of the layout of Toronto, he wasn't coming up with anything.  I had remembered looking up restaurants earlier, and found this restaurant consistently coming up in the searches.  I asked for the address.   1220 Queen St E.  This might be strange for me to mention.  So we got on the street car on Queen St, after walking from Eaton Center.  This seemed to be a no brainer.  We got there, we are looking around.  

Two things I learned after this visit to this restaurant. 

1. Many buildings are not numbered in the city. 
2. Make sure you have the phone number. 

We couldn't find the restaurant based on the number.  We noticed a building with a big nose on the front that seemed funny.  My friend who's from Toronto, thought that we must be on the wrong side, and my friend from the states must have read it wrong from the website.  So we headed on the street car all the way to 1220 Queen West, which is completely on the other side of the area.  As you might have imagined, once we got there, of course it wasn't there.  I got a phone number to this place, and found that it was indeed East. So at this point more determined than ever, I decided that we were going to eat at this place.  So once again, we got on the street car the other direction.  It's a good thing she has a monthly pass, because these tokens were costing me an arm and a leg.  

So we get back to where we were roughly an hour earlier.  Mind you we left for this place around 6 and got there around 8:30.  So we're looking around, again not seeing it. We figured we'd got see what this nose was.  And of course, it is Gio Rana's.  

SO, for anyone going to this place, LOOK FOR THE NOSE.  LOOK AT THE PICTURES, otherwise you wont' find this place.  TAKE DOWN THE NUMBER IN CASE YOU ARE LOST.  We were walking around in this bitter cold, which added to the mess. 

Ok, now to the restaurant experience itself.  

1. This place seemed to be bustling with a full restaurant on a Thursday night.  
2. We were seated in another awkward place in front of the window, and had to slide by some other folks to get in there, but we had a bit more privacy.  
3. We decided on calamari for an appetizer. 
4. We asked two separate waiters for suggestions. 

a. the first waiter recommended - the involtini and the rib eye.  He said he would often crave a involtini on many a late night
b. the second waiter recommended - the involtini and the ossobuco

So we ordered, the fritto misto appetizer, for entrees we ordered the involtini and the ossobuco.  No alcohol or other drinks, just water. 

The fritto misto was decent, my friend said she had better.  I thought it was ok. 

The ossobuco was pretty tasty.  The involtini was ok.  We took the leftovers home which I ate some of on saturday, and I had the same feeling.  Ossobuco was tasty.  The involtini was ok.  It is amazing to see a cold ossobuco, and how much fat there is in the sauce.  But I guess that's the price of eating out. 

The environment seemed pretty good for a date.  We just had a long night even getting there.  The service was ok.  The waiters seemed pretty nice, but very busy.  

I am giving this place a 3.5, but since I can't it's getting rounded down to a 3.  This was decent, but there seems to also be a lot of hype.  I would have to try it out again with less drama getting there for me to accurately rate it. 

This also ran about 11-30 per person, again, no alcohol or other drinks, just water in the bill.

So, we left. Went downstairs and are inside. Thankfully, we were tended to and she was awesome. Zucchini appitizer was really good. Shrimp and grits were great with the exception of the sausage. Tasted like a cheap hot dog. The grits and gravy made it worthwhile. The burger with pimento cheese and bacon was also great. Huge. Fries were good as well.

10905,2,1547251200000,"Sunset Grill at Whiskey Island is my favorite spot in the summer. Its reminiscent of something you'd see in a larger city, with the outside bar and small green space located next to a marina. 

In the summer, watching the sunset over Big E is a grasping visual. In the summer, I'd say the views from the Grille beat that of any bar or restaurant in Cleveland. Literally, you're on the water. Okay, not 'literally' on the water, because then you'd be some type of superhuman or one of the figures from the Bible. 

Wendy Park is right next door. If you find yourself boatless, play some sand volleyball (the courts are right along the lake) or have an afternoon picnic and visit the Sunset Grill for a nightcap (you're also allowed to buy alcohol from the Grill and take it into the park). As an added bonus, you'll get to watch all of the fancy sunburned boaters come off their fancy boats. You'll consistently use the term ""fancy"" with sarcastic tone because you'll be jealous they own a boat and you don't.

Pets are allowed. There's an area to fill up water bowls. On a weekend, you can bring a blanket, lawn chairs, your pooch, listen to the band and throw back some cold ones. Who would actually throw a cold one? Where did that phrase even come from? Why am I questioning that phrase during a review when I could just erase the text before I hit submit?

The drinks are priced a little higher than your average watering hole in Cleveland, but they're a little cheaper than what you'd find in trendy spots like the Warehouse District or Ohio City. Food was good from what I've had. Simple, no frills items like bratwurst, Angus burgers and beer can chicken. [EDIT: They've updated the menu and some of the facilities since this review, the items are the same, no frills, but still decent enough] Most of the items are under $10 and the quality of the food reflects the price. If the food would be a little higher quality, this spot would easily be five stars.",3

My faves are the andouille hustle and the pork rambler. Go for the former if you're feeling gravy, the second if you want a sandwich. I usually add an egg. the biscuits are massive so you don't need a side but the tots dipped in the gravy or hollerback sauce are so good.

10934,3,1547683200000,"After reading the Isthmus review for their Sri Lankan curries, I made the trek out to the west side with some friends. The curries are indeed on the last page of their menu, hidden away a little bit. The rest of the menu is an odd mixture of ""Southwestern"" offerings (burritos, quesadillas, etc), Cajun food (gumbo, pulled pork), and pan-Asian food (stir-fry, teriyaki). I can't vouch for any of those other cuisines, since we all got curries, but let me tell you, the curry is where it's at. 

We all asked for our curries hot, and that was a pretty manageable level of spiciness (maybe not if you are a native Midwesterner). Among the four of us, we had the dhal curry, mixed vegetable curry (one of that night's specials), and the eggplant dish (do not remember what it was called, one was a curry and one was fried eggplants). The eggplant dish was a bit on the salty side, but the dhal (lentil) curry was really tasty. You can get brown or white rice on the side. One of the things I found odd about KJ's was the pricing for their curries. The chicken and potato curry was $14, and the potato curry was about $12. A little pricey, compared to the green bean curry ($8) and dhal curry ($7). 

Aside from that, the curries are definitely worth checking out, and they have a different special every weekend. Go get you some spice.",2

My wife had a burger that was cooked nicely to order with steak fries.  I had a build your own fried chicken sandwich that was simply phenomenal with sweet potato tots!

Ok, not really a word, and, of course, I can't really leave a review at one noise, but seriously....mmmmm. I could eat this food all the time...except then I would be super fat, so I won't, but the point is that I could!

I went here on Monday night for my sister in law's birthday/anniversary party. We had a large group of at least ten people. Our waiter, Rodger, was great! He was very attentive, kept our waters full, and even remembered everyone's order correctly without writing it down...pretty impressive stuff. 

I ordered the steak frites, but because we were such a large group, I got to try a bunch of menu items. We started with the fondue (soooo good....I wanted to eat it straight with a fork), the loaded chips (?), also very tasty, and the mini corndogs, good, but not as good as the other two. My steak was delicious, it had an herb butter on top and was cooked perfectly. The fries were crispy and perfect. The BF got the burger with church potatoes. The burger was a pretty standard burger....not something I would come here for specifically, but the church potatoes were pretty good. I tried someone else's ribs.....EXCELLENT! The bbq sauce was spicy and sweet...the meat fell off the bone...this is something I would definitely recommend. I think our table had (possibly) one of each entree and everyone raved about the food. I would definitely come back here again.",2

Chef Dan is a true genius he is a true master at his craft. 

As for the menu it's so hard to choose I just want to order everything. Last time I was there I ask my server Jean if she could creat a tasting menu for our party of 8. I'm so glad I did she took care of the entire meal from oysters to sashimi to steak. We finished off with Japanes cheesecake and baileys ice cream.

There are A LOT of little annoying rules though, which I am sure have a very important purpose other than to annoy -_- For example, no bags inside the gym area. UNDERSTANDABLE (somewhat), but I had a very small pack on my back ( for my water bottle, towel, keys, etc) because it was my 1st day and I did not have a lock for the locker. I was told that this was not allowed. I could understand if the bag was on the floor or dangling on the machine creating a safety hazard...I also found it inconvenient that it's not a 24/7 gym and that they close super early on weekends (that should be considered peak times/days, in my opinion). Also I despised the layout of the equipment. Everything facing forward to me just made me feel like I was on a stage (of course no one is paying attn to any particular person!) when I had to use the equipment toward the front of the gym. I ultimately stopped going out of boredom of being in a facility & feeling like it was detracting from my other/outdoor activities.

10978,1,1547596800000,"Just wanted to give a huge thank you to Eric for fixing our headache of a plumbing problem! Upon doing our first load of laundry in our new house, sewer water came up in both our bathrooms. We had a handy man come snake it (as it happened over Memorial Day weekend,) but the issue remained unresolved. Eric came out first thing the next day on 6/1/17 and, unfortunately for him, had to climb under our manufactured house amidst the black widow haven. He spotted several major plumbing issues right away, and gave me multiple options on how to solve it. He ended up having to get up on the roof and jet the clogs, then climb back under the house and dismantle and reinstall 5 feet of shabby plumbing done by the landlord's contractor. He did so without complaint, even after having to spend over 6 hours at our house to make sure it was done right. He took before and after pictures so we could show our landlord, and was incredibly informative and knowledgable about the whole process. His work came with a 5 year parts and labor warranty, and 2 trips of additional jetting, should we need it. He even stayed while we ran a load of laundry to make sure all the problems had been solved before he left. It's been over 2 weeks and there have been no other problems whatsoever which has been a tremendous relief. Thank you Eric! Highly recommend this company.",2

 So a lie/ incompetence in the back cost the restaurant 36 bucks as three of our party got meals 1/2 of what the crab cost and the second strike of not coming back.

10991,3,1547510400000,"I used five star moving to move our 3-bedroom upstairs apartment to a downstairs condo. It was very stressful having to manage everything needed to move all our stuff. I searched the web for a moving service and found Five Star Moving. Compared to other movers, their rates are the best so I hired them. 

They charge $100/hr for 3 well-equipped people. This means that they have all they moving equipment (Dollies, harnesses, cloths, straps, etc) they will need. A minimum charge of $300 (3 hours) and time is rounded up to the nearest half-hour. I spent $350 (3.5hours) to move our 3 bedroom apartment. Every single dollar I spent for their service was well worth it. Trust me when I say that they will treat your stuff like it was their own.

TAKE NOTE: you have to rent your own truck, which is about $40 dollars(for one day) + insurance and mileage. Renting your own truck will save you money (other companies charge $130/hr for a 3-man and their own truck). In my case, no one in our family knew how to drive a 26 foot truck so they gladly met me at the u-haul and drove it for us.

With that being said, if you're at the edge of hiring them or not. I highly recommend them. Renting your own truck is easy and they can gladly drive it for you. If you're stressed out with the prospect of moving just hire these people and they will take care of you. All you have to do is pack all your stuff properly and they will move it very quickly. The owner even called me a few hours after they left to make sure everything went well.

ADVICE: I was very stressed out with the prospect of our move that I even forgot to bring our bottled waters to our new place and had to buy some from the store. So, DO NOT stress out over your move, all you need to do is pack everything properly. Put everything in one place and they will put it in the truck very fast (I'm not even kidding, these people work fast and efficiently). Please, have some water ready for them, a few crackers or something. Something quick to eat. That's all you need to stress about. 

If I wasn't short on my cash right now I would've definitely tipped them. It was well worth it.

Maybe not everyone shares my preference for strong black coffee, but this was under-mild (I'm coining that word) and actually, lukewarm. Granted it was busy around 8am with only one barista.

One of my party slipped on a puddle of liquid that was already on the floor outside of the kitchen as she walked back to our table from the restroom. nobody helped her up, employees saw but didn't come to her aid, somebody came out with a mop and mopped it up quickly. 

Soon after that a guy came up to our table and asked what happened? We told him she slipped on water but was okay and she said wanted to be left alone (she was very embarrassed). He asked her where the water was, and he didn't say it as if he cared, but said it like, there's no water there. I told him it was cleaned up and it was right there (near the kitchen door). He went away. Next up was another guy. He came out with a clipboard to another of my friends at the table and said ""I heard you fell, what happened?"". We told him it wasn't this person, it was Another at the other end of the table. Now by this time, My friend is completely embarrassed. She has said she just wanted to be left alone. New guy goes up to her and asked her to describe what happened. She said she slipped on liquid and fell but that she was fine. He started asking, well where is the water? She explained it was cleaned up already. He jokingly said, are you sure it wasn't that French fry (pointing at some food on the floor)? Come on, she is humiliated and now you're joking around, possibly implying again she fell on purpose?! Then he decided to ask if she needed an ambulance. She told him again she was fine and wanted to be left alone. He took down her information and after making us all uncomfortable, he walked away.

The waitress, who didn't care whatsoever about what happened and never even said she was sorry, took about 45 minutes to bring us our bill. They didn't even discount her plate for her fall, which would have at least been classy. Nobody apologized, they just made sure that she was not going to call the police or sue.

The Caesar Salad was flavorful and not overdressed, the Fettuccine Casanova was interestingly spicy with a great creamy sauce, the Mambo II Pizza (done pan style) was meaty and cheesy, and the Hedgehog ice cream dessert was a great finish. My meal was also packaged with the hot and cold items separate - great attention to detail - and ready right on time. If I had to complain about something, I'd say the pasta was a little overcooked for my taste, but that's a personal preference. 
The location is a little out of my way, but I would definitely go here for a satisfying meal or take-away again anytime!",2
11063,2,1547942400000,"I'm going to start off by saying that they say that they close at 11 PM of which I think that they do however it must be noted that the kitchen closes at 10 PM. With that being said we got there at about 9:55 PM last night because I was at a speaking event and wanted some dinner. So we walked in and were told that the kitchen closes in a minute if you want to that they weren't sure if they were able to serve us so I initially got irritated but then the manager said out not a problem will be more than happy to serve you. Then we sat down and we ordered for it quickly out of respect for the kitchen because we didn't want to keep them there any longer than they had to be. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich and my girlfriend ordered for tacos. My chicken sandwich was very good it came out nice and juicy I know what you see is a funny word but it did. The boar was a little too gamy for my girlfriend but that has no reflection on this restaurant or the food itself it's just the animal being a bore.
What was really nice however unnecessary was that when I happen to tell my waiter he went to the manager and only charge half price for that. Again completely unnecessary but also very nice. 
The lighting in there was good all of the TVs were nice it was an all-around chill place to go and I'm glad that we went there. It would've been nice if you would've been able to order dessert however again the kitchen was closed so will just have to go there a little earlier next time. I'm giving this five-star review because it meets all of my criteria.  

One more massively huge point I must say about this place is that the tables come equipped with three prong outlets and USB outlets so that you never have to worry about your phone dying that is by far the best part about walking in that place that I found out.",2

They had all the standard shrimp dumplings that I love and they definitely seemed fresh and delicious. The prices are reasonable. The tea was quite good. The place was fast and efficient.

To my shock I found that instead of giving me Levoflazacin I was given levetiracetam an  anti-seizure, anti epileptic medication. Of course I phoned the pharmacy and they found they had made an error and then had me come in to get the correct medication. BUT, that was a very dangerous error. 

I also phoned my doctor and explained your error and was told that because of the high dosage 750mg I must be weaned off because to just stop could now cause me to seizure.

Your pharmacist did give me a half hearted apology but because of his nonchalant attitude it leads me to think he found it no big thing and maybe they make these kind of errors frequently.

They had specials that looked interesting, but I had no time to consider that, of course. The sushi chefs were already giving me dirty looks for coming in so late. :/ 

Sashimi tasted more like nigiri without the rice. It was thick and contained some stringy fattyness, not even the usual for nigiri let alone sashimi. It was hard to bite into. Salmon was the best - soft and pretty fresh. Tuna was tough as tomatoes! Miso was the lazy kind without any tofu pieces in it. Eh. I wouldn't go back except maybe to sample their Malyasian food.",2

11129,3,1548633600000,"The Eaton Centre is a big attraction in Toronto, and I can understand why. Usually one of the first malls to get new stores (Sephora, Bath and Body Works, Hollister, etc), convenient location with 2 Subway stops, great place to bring tourists, etc. 

If you are going to actually shop with something in mind, it is hellish. This mall has its fair share of slow-walkers and even those who decide to have a conversation, stopping and standing at the top/bottom of escalators. It is a true ""hang-out"" for teenagers, and while I am trying to not sound like an old curmudgeon, they usually irritate me.

There are 2 very useless food courts. I say useless, because there is rarely any seating, the selection of fast food isn't that great, and they are both at basement-level. Not well lit, noisy, and really - what is up with the 2 food courts? I can see how it would be a good idea, but sometimes I want to get something from food court #1, while my shopping partner was hoping to get something from food court #2. They should've just made a big, central one. 

My other gripe with the Eaton Centre is the double-stores. There are some stores with 2 Eaton Centre locations. Really, the mall is not THAT large, I don't see the point. I hate when I am, say, shoe shopping and I'm in Aldo thinking ""I swear I've already seen all these shoes..."" and then I remember I have, at the other Aldo, at the other end of the mall. I guess this is me just being really picky, now. 

Anyways - I will continue to go here from time to time, because there are some newer stores and my friends/family will always drag me out here. Though I wouldn't suggest doing any actual Christmas shopping here, it is a great mall to visit around that time of year. The tree is beautiful and their Santa set-up can't be beat!",2

By the way, they have moved to a new location.

If you want to make your kid cry, go ahead and sign them up!  This was my daughter's first experience with a true dance class after taking ""dance"" classes where the kid's more or less just had fun to music.  She was so excited to have her pink leotard, her little ballet skirt and a tap and ballet shoes.  The first day of class I discovered that some of the girls in the class had already taken the same class several times, one for at least a year...but they weren't progressed to another class, the classes were designated by age, not by level.  So, the teacher went through the movements and expected the girls to follow along.  She did not stop to help them and showed frustration at then for not immediately following along.  Did I mention this is a class for THREE YEAR OLDS and it's the FIRST DAY OF CLASS?  Managing your expectations was definitely not part of the training here!  I thought about complaining, but then realized the instructor (who did not introduce herself) was actually one of the owners.  I decided to take her to a class on a different day, with a different instructor, hoping she would be less intense with such young children just starting out.  I was wrong.  This class was with the other owner, who opted to make multiple children cry.  Keeping in mind that this is a class of three year olds and it was only the second class, the instructor yelled at the girls for fidgeting while they were waiting for the other girls to take their turns.  My daughter came running out of the room and said she was told she would not be allowed to dance if she couldn't stand still until it was her turn.  Why anyone would think this was the way to treat such a young child is beyond me comprehension.

I left two voicemail messages, sent an email, and a letter informing the Dance Project that we would not be continuing classes and to cancel all future enrollments after two classes.  They have an ""automatic renewal"" policy so I wanted to be sure that we were not automatically renewed.  No one returned my calls, my emails, or my letter.  Four weeks later, I received a call requesting my next payment.  Not only did they not return my calls, they either didn't notice, or didn't care that my daughter had not been in the class for  four weeks, but they wanted more money.

As a teacher, I want to ensure that my children develop a love of learning.  It is crucial that early teachers and learning experiences by positive so that children will want to continue to learn.  Fortunately, my daughter loves dancing, so she was willing to try another class (at another school of course) and she has been taking classes there for weeks now -- not only does she love it, she is thriving and learning quickly.",2

11186,3,1546473600000,"We discovered the existence of King's Kitchen based on a Living Social deal a few weeks ago. After seeing the number of ratings the place had we knew it was worth making the purchase. The deal was for one appetizer, two entrees and one dessert for $25, which was quite awesome. We headed down there for dinner tonight after taking in an afternoon hockey game and spending some time at the Mint Museum.

King's Kitchen is a nice little place right amid the hustle and bustle of Charlotte. Upon entering you find a bright, clean-looking restaurant with one of the nicest bars I've ever seen. I usually opt out of sitting at a bar, but if the need arose I wouldn't have any second thoughts about popping down there. The rest of the indoor tables are a bit close to each other, giving you little privacy, but I've been smushed more by other restaurants. There were also some tables in an outdoor area, but the wind was a bit much to deal with that. We had made reservations so upon entering we were seated quickly and our server came over shortly after to take drinks and whatnot.

We were a bit limited on what to order since there was a separate menu for those using the Living Social deal (something that was not mentioned anywhere on Living Social), and I wasn't crazy about the choice of appetizers. We ended up settling on the pimiento cheese ($5) with lavash (sp), which ended up being these really light crackers. The pimiento cheese had a nice spice to it, and definitely went well with the cracker. There was definitely an excess of cheese to cracker, at least for us, since the cheese was a bit much (spicy and rich) to be spread too abundantly over the crackers. They did offer us bread to sop up the remainder of the cheese which was nice, but with two full meals coming we decided to not stuff ourselves.

For dinner I ordered the fried chicken ($13) with butter beans, sea island red peas and roasted carrots. I went with the white meat, which consisted of breast and wing. The batter is nice and light, but I wish it had come out a bit crisper. The flavor was totally there and it tasted great, but the chicken was a bit drier than other fried chicken breast I've had. The butter beans were awesome, but I wasn't a fan of the red peas. I had never had them before so I have nothing to compare them to, but I just wasn't a fan of the overall flavor. The roasted carrots were crazy good, and I never thought I'd be raving about carrots after any meal. They are char broiled so they have all the black char on them and they are so soft and flavorful...almost tasted like sweet potatoes!

The only fish on the limited menu was fried flounder ($14), but the miss' isn't a big fan of fried foods. Luckily the folks at Kings Kitchen were kind enough to substitute that for the blackened catfish ($20) at no upcharge, which I was very grateful for. This blackened catfish knocked my socks off. It had the PERFECT level of spice...I like enough spice where my nose will run, but not too hot where I have to chug a gallon of milk after each little bite. This blackening spice was right at the threshold for me, where it met the maximum but did not stray over even a little. She also got the mac & cheese, creamed corn and collard greens. The mac & cheese  was good, but a little too mushy for us. I really loved the creamed corn...it had this sweetness to it that made it the perfect side. I was not a fan of the collards, but I don't really like any greens, so don't take my word on the collards to heart.

For dessert we split the chocolate and peanut butter cake with vanilla gelato.  I don't usually rave about a dessert, but this one is definitely worthy of it. The cake is a couple of layers of chocolate, peanut butter and ganache with some crispy layers thrown in also. The contrast of the soft cake to the crispiness worked well, and the ganache was simply indulgent. Then you had the heaping scoop of vanilla bean gelato. It was soooo rich and thick and the miss' detected a hint of some spice (possibly cinnamon) that really brought the flavor out. When you combined a little spoon of gelato with a spoon of the cake, you really had the ultimate dessert.

Kings Kitchen definitely dishes out some slammin' Southern cuisine, and I love that they do it for a good cause at a great price with heaping portions. While some of the food was totally spot on, some of it was also lacking a bit. If I could dish out 4 1/2 stars I would, but I think there are a couple of things keeping it from 5 stars. Still, I totally recommend heading down to get some serious eats on.",3
11188,3,1548720000000,"Food did taste delicious, but average among the restaurants at the similar premium price mark. Service was also up on par with other fine dining restaurants.

However, I'm not sure if all these are worth the week long food poisoning torture I have to go through. I nearly missed half of my Maroon5 concert that was right after the meal. Still carrying stomach ache as I'm typing this review. After finding another reviewer's complaint about food poisoning at Mastro's after ordered the same plate sea bass on Trip Advisor, I figured I should share my experience and warn the yelpers.

Being a sushi lover (eat raw fish almost every other week if not more often), I consider myself a foodie with a tough stomach. However, my trained stomach cannot win over this meal. My husband and I shared every other plate except for the entrées and the cocktails and he turned out fine. (For the record, I ordered pan seared sea bass and dream berry.) So I'm guessing it's either this sea bass that still cannot rest in peace and enjoys surfing in my belly, or it's the berries used in the cocktail that may not be as fresh as these should be.

This hotel is vile - it's designed to extract money from you from the minute you set foot in it- it's tacky, the staff are robots and they even charge to use the safe! We upgraded to a remodeled room and it was okay nothing special our friends had a room that hadn't been remodeled and it was horrible. I will never ever set foot in this place again.",1
11248,1,1548460800000,"Very over rated. 

$30 for two sandwiches  $30.

Then when you pay with debit....they ask you what percentage or $ amount for a tip? Why tip when it's counter service? ? That's like tipping at subway.....doesn't make sense.


Surprised people keep coming back but I guess it's the only cafe in the area so we have to put up with the inflated prices and daft staff.",3

From the moment you walk in, you're treated like family, as if you've been coming to his studio for years. Jose is extremely knowledgeable and professional with every one of his clients. He is highly informed on the latest trends and popular hairstyles so if you're not sure what you want just ask! If you want the best, come to the best and I promise you won't be disappointed. After being cut by numerous other barbers I can honestly say that Jose delivers the best quality cuts that exceed the industry standard time and time again. Thanks as always Jose!",2
11252,3,1546646400000,"Came here for a dinner with my significant other. Ordered the fish tacos, lobster, and ahi tuna poke. Everything came out promptly and was very delicious. Our waitress was extremely helpful and friendly. For a Friday night, it was very quiet, which was pleasant. Will be returning!",2

11254,1,1547856000000,"I actually came here initially because they were doing a special cookie dough milkshake I heard about on the radio, where $1 of the proceeds from each milkshake sold went to a hockey program for underprivileged youth.  So, that tells you something about the restaurant's priorities!  The milkshake turned out to be absolutely decadent.  I've since gotten the caramel-and-pretzel milkshake too, and that was as amazing as the first one had been.  The fiance was very happy with his s'mores milkshake too. 

But, this isn't a review of Shake-a-tory.  

And the burgers absolutely live up to the hype.  Now, the fiance has had bad luck with ""build-your-own"" burgers here, but I have been gobsmacked by each and every burger I've ordered off of that menu, especially the big, juicy Morty's Steakhouse Burger.  Highly recommended!  Get the nachos...and the truffle fries...and the parmesan peppercorn fries...!!

It's true that there's a long wait, but it's worth it.  Go check out some books at the nearby Barnes & Noble, indulge your feminine side at the Bath & Body Works, or just sit at the bar.  The atmosphere and service are just right: there's not too much noise or distraction, but it's not so quiet you feel like everyone can hear your conversation; and the wait staff is attentive without being intrusive.  Seriously, I love it here.  It's a great casual dining option for the weekends.",2
11256,2,1546905600000,"I've only been here a few times, and each time I've had the same thing - a waffle with chocolate/vanilla soft serve on top.

My boyfriend and I always share it but it's so delicious I could eat the whole thing on my own lol.  The waffle is hot and fluffy and is great with the cold soft serve on top.

Usually really busy (similar to Tom's dairy freeze) and it can be hard to find parking/seating.

Great place to come on summer nights.",2
11261,3,1548288000000,"There are better buffets in Vegas, but for the price of $25 for lunch and you get bottomless mimosas/champagne it's a good deal. The selection is small and the food is nothing fancy. However, if you're looking to try the ultimate Vegas buffet experience, try the buffets at Wynn or Caesar Palace.",2
11266,1,1548633600000,"We went here on Sunday when we found out another place was closed. We were hungry and wanted to sit someplace cool.
The service was just OK. They weren't rude, just not very interested in serving us. When we got there all the servers were at a table eating.....
The food was filling and the portions were very large but lacking in flavor and spice. I like spicy food so that was a disappointment.
All in all it was OK and I could go there again to see if it was just an off night.",2

and they're not stingy with the sashimi!

Wait just a minute! how the hell do they manage to have so much fresh fish when they're located in the middle of desert? Better than the places back at home in CA. 

Next time your in Vegas take a little trip, about 15 minutes away from the strip, come here with a big group, order everything on the menu, 
and enjoy!!!",2

I felt very welcome, and happy by the upbeat atmosphere. Good breakfast with coffee and tea available all the time. Excellent options as far as what's in the area, in terms of a grocery store within walking distance and a great outdoor mall (in Arizona in July-- HOT). It was so nice to be able to take the shuttle everywhere I wanted to go. My room was very comfortable with a mini-fridge and microwave. I'd highly recommend this hotel!",2

Took another cut to see the same inside. See attached photo! The polite server returned at the end of our meal. He saw I had not eaten it, he asked if it was okay. I reported to him the off color meat. He apologized but did zero to inform the manager. We will not be back. The service was a four star the overall food a 1. Two stars was generous.",2

11342,1,1547337600000,"Update to my review -  We came back to this restaurant for lunch on a 2nd trip to Vegas, which i NEVER do (like to try new spots). Again, very good. Super casual lunch, nothing too wowwing about it ambiance wise, but i had an amazing salad, we got the chicken parm again, and the garlic bread knots - wowwie so good. It takes us forget to navigate thru Venetian to find it but worth it.


(original review):
HANDS DOWN... Best ever. Highly recommend. Very casual feel, small place, but absolutely amazingly delicious food, charming server, and just an all around authentic traditional italian feel. From the olive oil and vinegar on the table for fresh bread, the delicious sauce, their tiramisu - delicious. 3/5 of us got the chicken parm - it was delicious. Salads were great and shrimp scampi meal also great. If you're staying in or near the Venetian, you've got to go here. I had just a wonderful experience... thanks to Yelp, because that's how i found it!!",2
11344,1,1547164800000,"Not good quality food at all. Meat texture was dry, noodles were funny tasting. Horrible selection of food items. Dessert station was never replenished just very very bad. This place will not last in this town.",2
11352,3,1546732800000,The best a movie theater could be that is what this theater is. Enjoy a drink or a cookie or both. It's a little on the expensive side; but well worth the indulgence.,2
11354,2,1548028800000,"It's a modern strip mall. Not very big, but with a few decent restaurants (by Valley standards, not for visitors). It feels like they tried to trend it towards professional 20-30somethings rather than families, but they fell flat. 

Everything here is a chain. That's not an indictment of chains in general, but it creates an experience without any personality. It feels overdone. 

On the plus side, there's really nothing else there. It's better than nothing.",2
11359,3,1546992000000,"Tried to ship a package here via UPS.  Payment was via receiver through their UPS account number.  I was told that UPS stores can't handle this simple type of transaction and that I need to go to the UPS Depot across town.

What can brown do for you?  I continually have issues with UPS and any sort of convenience.  If available for your shipment, I highly recommend the convenience and ease of FedEx.

2 stars for nice staff.",1
11362,1,1546300800000,"Consistency in food quality is a hard thing to find. Fran keeps getting better. Great new dinner menu that includes a new ""new south"" burger (awesome) and a menu of pizzas that are fantastic to share. Even great for takeout. Fran can never disappoint!",2
11365,1,1547596800000,"Service was good, but billing and administration was a nightmare. I paid my deductible and my insurance was to cover the rest. Cheyenne then billed me my deductible amount again, and I tried several times to speak with them on the phone and get things cleared up/ understand what amount I owed. Each time I was told they would review it and then call me back, which they never did. Then I received a collections notice w/ interest, and they had never called me back once. I just went ahead and just paid the bill to be over this hassle. ughh",2
11381,3,1546560000000,"This review is strictly for the ice-cream shop as I have not tried the food there.
A piece of history...daily-made farm fresh ice-cream...This is as good as it gets! Despite having lived in the Charlotte area for 16 years, I ventured out to Tony's recently for the first time per my brother's recommendation. It was a great experience. The ice-cream there is fantastic! The place has been around for almost a 100 years now. It's not hard to believe by the look of the retro decor and somewhat dilapidated state of the building which only adds to the character. Since the shop is right next to the factory that produces Tony's ice-cream, you're guaranteed fresh ice-cream every day. Give it a try!",2
11383,3,1547683200000,This place is inside the Hilton and is nice place to have a quick drink. The menu is very limited but the food is good.,1
11394,2,1546992000000,"Good food but slow service. We ordered at 11- an hour ahead of time with 8 people. We arrived at 12 and still had to wait 15 minutes. The food came out and it was delicious! I ordered the Elvis crepe. It was filled with peanut butter and topped with bananas and bacon. Everyone else in going enjoyed everything from sandwiches to french toast. We asked for the check and waited another 15 minutes and had to ask again. There only seemed to be one server and one cook, which is why it took so long. Our server was friendly though, just seemed had too many people to help. We ended up being 15 minutes late, given an hour for lunch. I would come back but be sure to order before and ask for the check first.",2
11396,2,1547596800000,I love dining at Dressler's.  The food is always good and so is the service.  I recommend Just for the Halibut and please do yourself a favor and grab some cheesecake.  It's the best I have ever had...,1
11406,2,1547337600000,Amazing! They make the noodles and dumplings fresh right in front of you. Prices are fair and everything we had was delicious. Good for vegetarians and pescatarians.,2
11407,2,1546732800000,"First time I've been to Heist brunch, they apparently just reworked the menu.  The brunch buffet is a colossal amount of food and in a thinly veiled attempt to kill their patrons you're offered an à la carte item as well.  

So in addition to buffet items like the waffle, grits, biscuits, roast, flatbread pizza, potatoes (all excellent) and eggs, sausages, bacon (all pretty meh) we ordered the leaf eater omelet and the hash brown.  

I make omelets everyday like a machine that runs on eggs and butter and usually restaurant omelets are a watery, over cooked mess.  This omelet was on point with tomatoes that actually tasted like tomatoes (unfortunately seems to be more and more rare).  The hash browns  were also good.

So even though some of the buffet proteins were kinda gross (and really I don't think I've had buffet bacon or sausage that were good) I have to give props to Heist for their brunch.  A++++ would eat all my days calories in one sitting again.",2
11412,2,1547510400000,"We come here every weekend. All the coffee drinks are divine and the food is great! Such good quality on all their products. The manager is always friendly and helpful, and the staff provides good service. Always consistent, and I would say this is probably one of my favorite places to eat in Summerlin. :)",2
11415,2,1547510400000,"I wouldn't even give this place one star to be honest. It was disgusting. You end up spending 20 dollars on bagels, you expect at least good customer service. We bought a tuna fish sandwich melt at 7.95. The bagel was soggy, the tuna was sub par, it was a sloppy mess and completely revolting. We ordered an everything bagel toasted with butter but didn't have anything on it and was cold. We tried to give them back and explain why and they were extremely hostile to us, slamming the bagels we didn't want in the trash. They didn't offer to fix our orders, they just sarcastically, in a loud tone, told us to have a good day when we left. Wouldn't recommend this place ever.",2
11418,3,1547510400000,"Food is delicious, especially the chicken salad! The staff are great people, super nice. I try to go at least once a week. It's quick food too that's better quality and actually faster than most drive throughs. Made right I  front of you too!",2
11421,2,1546473600000,"Nice store. Lots of options and overall pretty organized. I got several things here for my home and I plan to go back. This store is huge!! Some of the aisles are really narrow. The carts are big and it would be impossible to have more than 2 carts on some of the aisles without having to have someone back their cart up. 

My only issue with this store is checking out. There was one cashier and 9 people waiting! When it was our turn they added another cashier and she kept yelling ""NEXT!!"" Several times even though she can tell we were going towards her. She was super impatient.",2
11425,2,1547424000000,"Dinner. Table for 4.

This was some of the best Italian food and service I've ever had! It felt like a mom and pop hole in the wall Italian restaurant run by a tightly knit family. Loved all the old black and white pictures on the walls. Made me feel like I was having dinner in someone's house.

Tried the Eggplant Parmigiana and tasted my friend's Tortilloni.  Both were absolutely delicious! Every bite was just as good as the last. The filet mignon meatballs were tender and full of flavor as well. The garlic knots were too good - unfortunately we filled up on the garlic knots that we couldn't finish our main course. 

So worth the stop if ever at the Venetian.",1
11426,2,1548806400000,"Great Korean food in Las Vegas! I got the 2 person Gangnam meal with my teenage son, who was starving! Thus the food better be plentiful and spectacular. It came with an assortment of meats and appetizers. All the meats were tender, flavorful and the filet mignon was melt-in-your mouth good! The miso soup that came with the food package was too salty and the bulgulgi bib bim pap was too sweet for my palate. So I got the plain white rice. 

The service was decent, but they were very rushed around because of the flood of people that came in. They could have used one or two more service people. 

We'll be back!",1
11430,1,1548806400000,Great little dive bar. Friendly bartendress good prices. Definitely not pretentious like other places in the area.,2
11434,3,1546646400000,"This place is pretty awesome. A lot like the old Rally's I remember as a kid. Fries aren't quite as insanely good as I remember but the burgers are pretty good. But, be careful leaving the drive-thru! It's super narrow and has a sharp bend and there are tire rub marks all over that damn thing... and I clipped my rim... damn it...",2
11436,2,1547251200000,"If you're looking to dine in a high-energy environment, go to Ru San's, where the chefs are often yelling and greeting you when you walk in. Ru San's has good sushi and Japanese food. Plus, it's pretty affordable. I'm not a sushi fan, so I tend to get vegetable tempura or teriyaki chicken, both of which are delicious at Ru San's. My sushi-loving friends love the place too.",2
11442,3,1547078400000,"I've been coming to the Opera House for shows for about 10 years now, and it's easily one of my favorite venues in Toronto.

It's not the most modern venue in the area, but I would have to disagree with some of the previous reviews that it's falling apart.  It does have the dive bar feel to it. but for the type of shows put on there, it's the perfect atmosphere. I mean, who would want to go to a metal show at some frou frou bar that serves nothing but martinis?

If you're looking to go to a show where you can kind of sit down. chill in front of the stage. and watch the show, The Opera House probably isn't the right venue for you. The main floor is standing room only, and most shows here are General Admission only.

They did just do some renovations to it, and the new men's and women's bathrooms are a lot nicer than they used to be. They also did some renovations to the front foyer and added really nice couches to the upstairs balcony area.

Highlights:
- Very easy to get to from most parts of Toronto, as it's right on a street car line

- Friendly, experienced security that gets people in pretty quick when there's a line. As long as you behave, you shouldn't have a problem. 

-Multiple bars, so you're not usually waiting long for a drink

- The balcony area. It's really nice to be able to take a minute from the main floor during the rowdier shows and still be able to see everything that's going on on stage.

- Well priced drinks. 

- Food?! I'm pretty sure it's only bar food and maybe only available during certain shows. But they did have it this past time I was there.

- Easily accessible & reasonably priced coat check. A very big plus in my book,

This is a venue that gets rented out for different kinds of shows though (I mostly attend edm shows), and each experience may differ depending on the promoter throwing the show. The core staff here that's been here for pretty much every show that I've attended here is great though.",2
11446,3,1548633600000,We ate here last Friday. It had obviously just opened. The sign on the building was kinda small but that didn't stop us.  All I have to say is 5stars! Excellent food excellent service! I had the spicy catfish with crab fried rice. This cozy mom and pop restaurant has a big time taste with a fresh and unique menu. You can plan on me coming back more than a few times a week!,2
11448,2,1548288000000,"Generally an good stay. Very clean, mostly friendly staff. Liked the room, modern feel, sleek, didn't have that ""too much cleaning fluid"" smell of an older place. Definitely liked the room.

Very unhappy with the breakfast. Says you get a tall coffee, which is actually a small. And the sandwich was more bread than anything else. I made a comment about the ""tall"" coffee being small (since it is) one server handed that well, the other was a bit snarky. Considering how nice the rest of the hotel was, to me would be better to not offer the breakfast than offer something that doesn't match the rest of the experience. Jut sort of brought my morning down, but not a game changer. Definitely my hotel of choice here.",2
11448,3,1548633600000,Had an early dinner with a friend here. Food was very good. We sampled several dishes.,2
11449,2,1547164800000,"I've been here once before about a year to two years ago and again today and I must say This place isn't special at all, it's pretty much a place you come to when it's your last resort and everything else around it is full & you absolutely need a pedicure. The older ladies that work here are very nice and pleasant however there is one young woman who works here who seemed very frustrated with how her day was going and did not seem like she wanted to do my pedicure at all or even be at work at that. This was very unfortunate as I had to suffer the consequences of her attitude and get a pretty crappy pedicure. I paid a total of $27 for a basic pedicure and a callous remover. Overall very lackluster, now I remember why I didn't come back after the first visit. By the way this place offers micro blading and I seriously would not test that ladies!",2
11452,2,1547337600000,"DO NOT COME HERE!! I just spent $26 on a ""supreme car wash"" the didn't even wipe the dust off my dash!! Hands down the worst car wash I have ever paid for!! My passenger side window has oil smears all over it... Worse now then when I brought it in to be cleaned!! If I could give negative stars I would!! I went back and told the guy hey look at all thus dust still on my dash and dirty window and spots on the outside aaaa we can redo it. Are you freaking kidding me I just spent 45 min waiting and now you're telling me the only thing you can do is re wash it!! I will never give them my business again I recommend you do the same!!",2
11455,2,1546387200000,"When I visit a restaurant, I judge it by asking myself this question. Do I want to come here again or not? For Crazy Don, it is definitely a yes. 

We had curry don katsu, creamy don katsu, kimchi fried rice and dduk-bok-e (Korean spicy rice cake dish). First we were served with corn soup as an appetizer which was creamy, chunky, not too salty nor bland - really delicious!. When the main meals came, I was surprised to see the huge portions (I think it was the biggest out of all the don katsu meals I tried in Toronto). The plate included don katsu (of course) along with rice, green salad, coleslaw and potato salad. The meat was crispy on the outside and tender inside, and the sauce came separately so that you can dip the meat into the sauce which is what I prefer to do. They also gave us some side dishes like pickled radish that were perfect combinations with the food. The kimchi fried rice was really good - came in a hot metal plate, topped with mozzarella cheese, not very spicy. If you are a dduk-bok-e lover, it is a must try! I tried this rice cake dish in many different restaurants and stores across GTA, and I'd say it was one of the best here. 
   
The atmosphere was very clean, spacious and trendy. I am quite very sensitive to the environment and hygienic conditions, and this restaurant generally had a clean vibe with well-maintained tables and floors. The location is also very easy and convenient to find, right by Yonge street near Empress Walk with good parking spaces right behind the restaurant. The only thing I'd say could be improved is the waiter's attentiveness. The service was generally good and courteous, but there were times when we were kept waiting for a while for our needs to be met. Regardless, the experience at Crazy Don was very pleasant and I'd love to return again.",2
11462,2,1548720000000,Good Service and Food!!!! This is my go-to Door Dash Delivery Chinese Restaurant! I've had it delivered to work several times when treating my coworkers and it's really good! Their sesame chicken is really good! The only thing is you can't ever just order chicken or beef by itself it always has to come as a combo with something else! But overall still a good place to check out!,2
11481,2,1548288000000,"I have to give this place the kudos they deserve.

They really put on a good show, and everything is done really well. The owner is actively engaged in the show, and you can tell he has really put quite a bit of work, and thought into making this great

My son had his 13th bday party there, and on the way out, I could hear all the kids mumbling about how great the party was.

Thx guys, my son won't forget that for a long time to come! You guys are awesome!",1
11482,3,1548633600000,"Bikesource is a great shop! They guys and a few gals who work there are very knowledgeable about their products. I have bought my mountain bike from there as well as many articles of clothing. For women they have a great variety of gear. From the ""biker chick"" or to more of the ""Enduro"" style rider. 

The staff every time I shop there makes me feel very confident as a rider. I never leave without a smile!! THANKS BIKESOURCE!",2

Though the sushi menu isn't the most extensive I've seen it's excellent fair! I haven't had anything that's disappointed me yet. The service is outstanding, and the owner recognizes me every time and makes a point to ask how my last takeout order was. 

Though its tucked into the 'burbs it's definitely worth a visit (even if it's just take out for a movie night!)",2

I asked for the check then the hostess asked if we still wanted a free dessert so I just went ahead and picked something out so we can get something free to compensate for the lack of attention span everyone around here seems to have.

This place is a disaster today but probably because it's Mother's Day. Still waiting on our food and it's almost been an hour. Took forever just to get water and napkins after repeatedly asking the waitress for it. Usually I'm nice about all this stuff but she offered both of my parents water and didn't even mind or yet even ask the whole table if they wanted water.

Odd to find bottom dwelling tilapia at a high end restaurant or cheese fondue, for that matter.  HIghlights were the black truffle mac and cheese, sweet potatoes with marshmallow brulee and crab cakes.  Did not find the steak anywhere as good as Mastro's or steak houses of that caliber, it was rather grizzly and tough.  Thank goodness we tasted the green peppercorn sauce prior to ordering, because that was frightful.  Not sure I would rush back, but did enjoy the evening.  Good friends helped!",2

Really, it's more I don't know you, you don't know me, how do you know what I might enjoy or have a taste for?

In this case I'm glad I put aside my thoughts on the matter, followed the bartender's suggestion and got the Burnt Ends.  Speaking of which, you don't know me and I don't know you but you should get it.  Really.  It's an awesome smoked and resmoked brisket sandwich that is so many layers of delicious, it's stupid.  It's juicy, flavorful and the sauce is done just right; present but not overwhelming.  The slaw is a correctly done supporting cast in the sandwich.  Also, coming it at around $7, it was easily tastier than more expensive crap I've paid for out here on the West Coast.

Combine this hunger inducing (and curing) sandwich with a delightful Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout enjoyed on draft (not to mention the availability of a number of craft beers on draft and in bottle) and the chill atmosphere and I was more than happy I braved the rain to visit this spot before heading back to Chicago.

Even if it wasn't in Urbana, this place would be able to hang in any big city either as just a beer bar or as a BBQ place.  I'll thank my lucky stars it does both.",2

FTR I am NOT a fan of flat fried burgers, I prefer grilled over a flame. Man I love the taste of a fire kissed hunk of ground beef. 

I read a few reviews and thought I should at least try the burger. I am glad I did. 

Hand pattied, fresh burgers, flat grilled to well done but still juicy. The beef had almost 0 flavor by itself but added nice texture to the entire burger as a whole. As a burger ""traditionalist"" I ordered the regular with bacon, lettuce, tomato's, pickle and mustard. No Jalapenos or cool little add ons. The condiments were all really fresh and had good flavor. (most tomato's lack this now a days) The double patty was a little much, I may go with the single next time. 

The building was busy with customers and staff, they run a tight ship. 

The prices can get a little high unless you eat smart, the frys are large, the burgers are large and the drinks are $2.19 for a large. Get the single burgers, share a fry and get water or skip the frys and eat the free peanuts.LOL 

I will go back.

A month or so ago the 2-3 waitresses we kept seeing and enjoying the services of disappeared, and since then the service has gone down slowly. My last visit we waited around for 5 minutes at the door with no hostess, I had to go to the bar and ask the bartender and who I can only assume was a manager or the owner to have a table cleaned for us and be seated (it was a little busy but nothing unmanageable). We sat around for a good 15 minutes before we got asked for drinks, our food was another good 30+ minute wait after we ordered. 2 tables got their food before we did, and any subsequent orders for more beer or anything were slow or forgotten. The wings too didn't seem right, we usually get really hot wings and the heat was non-existent with this order. I think our waitress was new cause she was very overwhelmed, but trying to do her best. But the way this place was run at our last visit turned us away as return customers. On a side note the men's washroom is ridiculously laid out with the sink directly in the way of the door, on a separate visit a drunk patron kicked the door open and I was washing my hands and my arm got bruised... Terrible building planning tbh.",1
11568,2,1548374400000,"My fiance, friend and I decided to try Sekong By Night. My fiance is Cambodian and we were pleased when our friend found this place. We went with an open mind and were delighted with the experience. 
  The restaurant was small and quaint. The decor was modern and traditional at the same time. Pictures of Buddah adorned the walls and the entry way had musical instruments on display. I loved the fact that there were Cambodian books on all the tables, great idea especially because most people don't know about Cambodia. The place was very clean and comfortable.
  The staff was amazing. Friendly, cordial and genuine. You could tell that this family run business really takes pride in what they do. Our server who is the sister of the owner came by and we had such a nice talk. Everyone came out to greet us, the owner, the owners mother. We all felt comfortable and welcome. 
  The food was DELICIOUS. They paid attention to detail and presented the food elegantly which added to the experience. We tried different dishes and shared family style. For an appetizer we ate Bok Lahong (papaya salad) and for our main courses we ate Lok Lak (which was beef cubes on a bed of lettuce), Somlaw Majou Manorah (pineapple soup) and Bai Morn (chicken and rice). Everything was so yummy and we finished with Jaek Kteeh (Banana Tapioca Pudding) which was to die for!
   The only suggestion that I have is that Sekong By Night should be added to google or have a website so that people can find out more about the place. It's a little hard to find, so this might help.
  Overall this was one of the best restaurant experiences that I have had. The staff was extremely friendly, food was authentic and delicious, the decor was exotic and inviting. Can't wait to go back and try out the other dishes.

The salted cod is not my thing way too powerful like those salted dried fish loaded of sodium can't handle it.   She noticed I didn't like it as much even gave me a discount .

The main criticism I would have is that they tend to rush through the appointments and I would prefer a more casual discussion with my doctors.  Taking the time to listen and discuss issues and concerns seems to me to be part of health care.
They provide a wide range of alternative health services which we love to take advantage of.  
If you are considering this health service you can rest assured that you will get excellent health care here.  You just need to be prepared for their system of time management.   The short lines are one of the positives of this method.  When you make your appointment you have to be specific about what you are seeing the doctor for and know about how much time it will take.  Once the appointment is set, that will be the time you will have.  
Their customer service has always been helpful and very friendly on the phone.  This alone is a super big plus to us.   Their billing is relatively easy to understand.
With the new Health Care Reform Bill they sent out a letter informing us that there will be little to no impact on our service because GHC was already doing the things that the Bill requires!  What's not to like about that.",2

11686,3,1547683200000,"I'm new to Vegas so I went off of some Yelp reviews which has become a prety common practice lately. Unfortunately Charisma wasn't anything special to look at. It's in a shopping center facing a run down, out of business, gas station and the interior looked dated. When I go to a salon I like to relax and soak up some ambiance. Definitely didn't get that at Charisma. I saw a female stylist and told her I was growing out my hair and I didn't want to lose length. She mentioned layers and I told her a little, but I definitely wanted to avoid a 90's inspired Rachel from Friends shag...which is exactly what I got. Lame sauce. On a personal note, they use and sell their own product and I wasn't crazy about the scents. I know, I know, what's in a smell? But that's an important little factor. 

On the plus side they aren't pushy with product sales and the shampoo and scalp massage were ah-maaazing. They were also able to get me in quickly. It was a Friday night and there weren't many people in there. I'm definitely bummed this place didn't work out for me. I've received better services for a fraction of the cost on mall salons.

11710,2,1546905600000,"This place is amazing! Here are my top 5 reasons why: 

1. They cater to VEGANS! If you're dining in, you can request the vegan cheese, which is tofu-based. It melts PERFECTLY. I even asked the server to double-check because it was way believable! I ordered the Verdure pizza (zucchini, eggplant, artichoke, mushrooms & spinach, sans the pecorino & mozzarella since they're dairy). I even made it more flavorful by topping my slices with my arugula salad, which came with a light, yet flavorful vinaigrette. I'm over here still trippin' out about the tofu ""cheese."" Delish!

2. The ambience. The inside of the restaurant is so detailed and designed with a baseball stadium in mind. Silver bleachers actually hang from the high ceilings and the tables are made of ash wood, the same exact wood used for baseball bats. Dope! The bar chairs look fresh too - I found out that they're actually repurposed oil drums shipped from Italy. Faaancy. The bar is right next to the kitchen, so there's a lot of action going on around here. 

3. The patio. We chose to sit outside since it was a nice day. It felt so mellow and laid-back, yet you get the energy from all the people walking through The LINQ's outdoor shopping plaza. Plus, gazing at the High Roller while munching on some pizza slices isn't too shabby, either. 

4. The location. I mean, I'd still go here even if it weren't at such a cool shopping space, but being at The LINQ makes it even cooler. If I want a vegan dessert, I'm only a couple of steps from Sprinkles, which serves up red velvet vegan cupcakes upon request. Holla! 

5. My hubby was happy. :) He enjoyed his food, so I know we'll come back to visit! He's not a vegan, so he enjoyed clam pasta and these fancy schmancy-type grilled cheese sandwiches (Mozzerella en Carroza if you want to get technical). Needless to say, he gobbled everything up! 

We're locals, so to say we'd back to a Strip resty means a lot. Plus, the staff was friendly and catered to my dietary needs. Anyone that doesn't give me ""the eye"" for being vegan is coo' peoples in my book, ya feel me! 

I recommend dining outside (definitely at night during the summer months!) just because the people-watching and High Roller view is awesome. But the inside is cool too, especially if you want to experience that baseball stadium / buzzing bar scene. I'm just hoping the vegan tofu cheese is here to stay! 

Oh, and if you're looking to eat on the go (like hitting up a show at Brooklyn Bowl - aw yee, that kinda rhymed!), there's a convenient walk-up pizza window to the left of the resty. 

Get your pizza on!",2

They have staple dishes, such as the giant Ceasar with a whole crab leg, a fried Mars bar for dessert, and the giant seafood platters. I`m actually not a big fan of seafood, so I get the beef short ribs marinated in Root Beer. Amazing. You need to reserve in advance even if it`s to sit at the bar - it`s not that big of a place -- but if you call a few days or even hours ahead you might get lucky. Last time we went, we paid $130 plus tax and tip for two full meals with appetizer and dessert plus four drinks plus coffee. The service was amazing too. Outstanding restaurant!",2

We've been to Mesa Grill twice, the first time we were simply floored by the flavors.  The lamb tenderloin salad was great, the shrimp tamale was amazing and the shrimp perfectly cooked.  The duck pancake had a smoky flavor and that combination of sweet and savory.

On our most trip, we again enjoyed the tamale.  We also had the tomato soup which was really good and lots of flavor from the fresh tomaotes and cilantro.   I had the chicken quesadilla, which was a boring but still delicious choice.  My wife ordered the buffalo burger, it was relatively lean, but still juicy and had a great natural flavor.

We also ordered chocolate cake and the server asked if we wanted ice cream. We said sure. Never did he mention it was extra, just made us assume it was a free option with the cake, like literally every other place. 
The cake was dry and cold in the middle and warm on yhe outside. It fell apart when i put my fork in it and it tasted so bad i couldn't finish it. The ice cream was subpar.

11747,1,1548720000000,"Love this place.  

I always start out at the Cafe area, and have had Carne Asada and Carnitas tacos, and tried a Carnitas Burrito.  Honestly, I'm a purest when it comes to burritos, and rather have the Roberto's/Felipitos style burritos, that are just meat and guacamole.  These here are the Rice, beans, onions and cilantro type.  Good, but not my style.  I won't take points away because it's not to my taste.  Tacos were great~

The store is clean and I mainly come here for the pre marinated meats, like Al Pastor, chicken and asada.  The prices are really cheap, and the marinades aren't salty, which I find a problem at other Mexican meat markets I've bought from.

Produce is way cheaper than what you find at the Gringo markets.  Great place to buy the staples such as limes, avocados, mangos, onions, etc.  Watch for their circular in the mail if you live in the area near Rainbow and Flamingo.  Extra advertised specials on Wednesdays and Thursdays, in a fold out on the right side of the circular page.

I've got to give props to the Cashiers, who are always friendly, and smiling.

11753,1,1547510400000,"Just spent the weekend there, from June 12 to June 14.  Went there to continue celebrating my big 3-0.  My husband and I weren't sure which Vegas hotel to stay in, I had waited until the last minute to book a room and was expecting to spend no less than $450 for two nights including tax--anywhere.  Wow, was I pleasantly surprised when I looked on the South Point website and noticed they were offering a 50% discount for 48 hours only.  I booked a room, and for 70 bucks a night we got a room on the 24th floor, and even though we were about 6 miles away, we still had a decent view of the strip.  

Not only couldn't we beat the price, we really loved the room.  It wasn't the fanciest room, but it was above average.  We traveled with both of our two year olds, and our room was roomy enough for the four of us.  

What we really loved was the easy parking, it had a normal parking lot in which we easily found a spot close to the hotel, and we didn't feel as if we had to walk through a maze to get to our room.  We also loved the easy check-in.  The check-in/check-out counter was right as you enter the hotel and to your right.  

Since the hotel just opened in December 2005, everything still looks new and our room was really clean and fresh.  As far as the smoke in the casino, I would say that it was no more smokey than any other Vegas hotel, and as soon as we got closer to the elevator and up to our room, the smell was gone altogether.

I have nothing negative to say about this hotel whatsoever.  We are really happy with our South Point experience and are planning to stay there again.",1

11763,3,1548028800000,"Winner, winner, BBQ dinner!? Yes! 

We signed in our group of 5 at 3:30 and were seated at 4 on a Saturday, get there early!

My family are sort of BBQ fanatics, we had to try 3 different places in Memphis last time we were down, so seeing Black Dog rated highly on Yelp, we had to go when they came down to visit!

Most of us had some variety of beef brisket while my grandmother also got ribs and my grandfather the chicken.

We thought the brisket was tender and flavorful and not overly fatty. We tried some of the ribs too and really liked them! Very thick and meaty rather than fall-off-the bone style, which some people prefer. My grandfather said the chicken was good, but he did not like the side of cornbread that came with it. A traditional southerner, this cornbread was more muffin-style and too sweet for his preferences (I thought it was good). We also did like the twice baked casserole, French fries and sweet potato fries that were on the side, as well as the slaw that was on our sandwiches.

Service was good but at the end a little slow to take our check due to a shift change, not a big deal!

Now come my only 2 complaints. Complaint #1 would have to be that Black Dog is pretty stingy with their sauces. What came on the sandwiches was hardly anything, probably less than your average BBQ eater would like. We tried 3 different sauces I believe the hot peach, Texas and one other one, they all appeared to be good but I really cant provide an accurate taste test because we had so little of it! We also did not want to pay an extra $0.25 for extra, although my father did anyway because he's a sauce maniac! My other complaint is that the portion size was probably smaller than most BBQ places for the price. Our sandwiches were $9 and they came with one side which varied in size based on what we got. I had the casserole which was just a little cup, whereas my mom had a decent portion of sweet potato fries. I didn't leave hungry but I would probably get the combo or platter next time!

Overall Black Dog has really great food for its location and I really like how I don't have to go to Memphis to get similar quality BBQ. It's nice to know that there is a local place that is very successful and also with great food and beer to go along with it.

I'll definitely be back!",1

11772,2,1548115200000,"Gallagher's Steakhouse is located right inside of the very popular New York Casino. So let's start with the ambiance....beautiful wooden floors, white table clothes, with all the silverware settings. It's kind of tight as you walk through, especially if there's a sporting event going on. My husband and I were promptly greeted and seated as we'd reserved ahead. Our initial hostess was very professional, warm and accommodating. As we were being seated our server pulled out my chair (my husband has an injured hand) and even assisted my husband with getting comfortable. My only complaint thus far is the restaurant is extremely tight, my chair was almost pressed against a door which separated the dinning area. So we ordered the crab cakes to start. The crab cakes weren't over filled with stuffing. There was a little crust like panko crumbs but the crab balls were filled with succulent blue crab. Please be aware, you will have a server but multiple staff will help you throughout your meal. Our drinks never went lacking! And even though it took a moment to familiarize myself with each person servicing us, they were all very kind, efficient, and accommodating. My husband ordered the prime rib. His only complaint is that he prefers it seared, Gallagher's prime rib is prepared in the oven, but the texture and flavor was dead on. Did I mention how LARGE it was. What stepped Gallaghers game up was when our server offered to cut my husbands prime rib. I was blown away by his compassion, service, and generosity as the restaurant was packed. To compliment his Prime Rib we ordered Mac and Cheese and the Sautéed Spinach. The spinach was perfect. The Mac and cheese had a chees sauce, so if you're a southern girl like me you'll tolerate it but you know it can't compete with over baked mac and cheese. Even if you cooked it like a soufflé. Moving on I order the Porterhouse! My steak by far was the highlight of my meal. The cut was extremely generous, the beautiful grill marks, with a little blood drippings on the top.

11831,2,1546732800000,"I don't know why anyone really needs to check Yelp for ""Las Vegas Strip"" but if anyone reads this one day, you gotta come. It's a Vegas feature!

Las Vegas Blvd, known as the Strip is a beautiful place, morning or night. You get a huge gamut of hotels. You can go to Mandalay Bay. You can go to MGM and look at their exhibits, the M&M store is down there as well. Luxor, New York New York. You can ride the tram/Monorail. You also can see Bellagio and their fountains. Celine Dion and Caesar's Palace are also there too, making sure they are the emperors of the Strip. Shop at the Forum Shops. Planet Hollywood has their own shops as well! Bally's and Harrah's, although old, are still here today. Aria/ Vdara/ Mandarin Oriental? are the hotels that make CityCenter, and you can shop and spend your money at that luxorious place. 

Still need more places?

You can visit Wynn/Encore. There's a Premium Outlets there as well. Venetian and the Grand Palace shops are there. Palazzo? Mirage? Treasure Island and their show? Heck, I bet I forgot a lot of the other hotels because there are SO MANY HERE.

One bad thing though is that there is a LOT of traffic. They have 4-5 lanes per direction but somehow traffic still exists here. People walking maybe? Probably. A lot of cars and honking are here as well.

Still not sastified?

There are probably some rooftop clubs and strip clubs here if you do so seek pleasure in Sin City. 

Of course, whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, am I right?",2

We decided to try Ted's Hot Dogs since so many people everywhere including the workplace rave about this place. Our order was taken and we got to the part were they top your order I noticed they put BBQ sauce on my no sauce chicken sandwich. I didn't want to hold up the long line to ask for a replacement.

THE MAIN REASON FOR THE ONE STAR RATING 

I tasted my iced tea and I am not certain what they filled my cup with? I didn't see bubbles for soda but it didn't taste like iced tea but the color was sort of dark. I asked my husband to taste it and he couldn't tell me what it was either. I think it might have been a mix of iced tea and diet soda syrup. I did NOT drink it and took a few sips of my husbands soda. If I can't trust them to give me iced tea that is a problem. 

The hot dog is extra fatty and greasy, the BBq chicken sandwich is overpowered with sauce and grizzle.
Also

The onion rings were a bag of greasy unseasoned crumbs with only a few pieces of onion. 


I know most people Love Ted's and they are most likely OK most of the time so give them a try!",2
11837,3,1548806400000,"Suliko Restaurant serves authentic Georgian food. For some one that never have this cuisine, it definitely worth a try. 

Carbs+Meat+Huge Portion

Khinakli, Georgian Dumplings definitely instagram worthy for its size. Suck out the meat juice during your first bite. Khinakli is supposed to be eaten with bare hands and the top, where the pleats meet, is tough, and is not supposed to be eaten. I found that it was super filling but lacking much seasoning. 

Crepes ""Suliko"" was well seasoned and a little roll of deep fried happiness

Special of the Day: Lamb Shank ($9.90) was tender but in a soupy tomato broth. Not much flavour and seasoning is missing in action.

I tried a few other items which were all OK aside from the Kebab which I found it overcook and dry.

Khachapuri Ajarski ($10.55) was comforting when eaten fresh from the oven with load of cheese on bread but best for sharing.

Georgian Food is simple and rustic and Suliko delivers. So if you want to experience Georgian Food, you won't be disappointed.",2

The Caesar salad was very good, not too much and not drowned in Caesar sauce, they even came out on a chilled plate which to me makes a huge difference.  
Jason our waiter was great, very attentive even though he was the only one working the lunch schedule and you could see he was running to keep up.
Our main meal came out and I had the shrimp scampi over angel hair pasta, I must say the shrimps are huge and you get four of them in a serving, they were perfectly cooked too.  However the pasta was a little bland for me, after adding some salt it tasted better, but shouldn't the salt be added during cooking, I have never had to add salt to pasta, even at Olive Garden and I don't go there that much.
My wife had veal piccata over pasta and she said the same thing about the pasta needing some salt, her Veal was ok but she said she had had better.

11918,3,1547337600000,"Upon entry to the restaurant, we thought with the yummy looking baked goods display, we were in for a delicious treat. However, I can say that I have not been treated worse at a restaurant in my entire life. The customer service gets zero stars, but we ended up having the pizza and house salad which were pretty good, but get only 2 stars since it was fine, not great. My biggest complaint is that we felt very unwelcome, and here's why. 
There are two sections in the restaurant. By the Bakery area there are seats. The back part has tables for dine in. My order was going to be a combination. ...a glass of wine and a nice salad, plus two slices of pizza.
We asked if we could sit in the restaurant area, since most of our order was going to be off the menu and there were no more seats in the front. Instead of making us feel welcome, they had a whole discussion why we couldn't get pizza there, or sit there cause where we were sitting is for ordering off menu only. We were in fact getting salad and wine off the menu.  We were told that there were no seats in the front and that's where we had to sit. (cause we wanted only slices not a whole pie). The hostess was loud and rude, and  I looked annoyed, and then the hostess said ""the boss is going to be mad"" but she'll just put us at a table in the corner and we can stay.  And we got sent to a table in the corner, with no table cloth, and no utensils like we were imposing. There were no other customers I might point out, that we were taking the table from.Here we are trying to give them money, and they wouldn't go out of their way for our business. They were going to turn us away. Very unprofessional especially in the restaurant business where the competition is abundant.
At first, I thought they were going to bring the utensils and table cloth,  but, they didnt. It then took another 10 minutes for someone to take our order.  I ordered cabernet, and got chianti, and wasn't told till it was to late.  When we were finished with our meal,  the check got dropped off, without us being asked if we wanted anything else- which we did. 
The food may be alright, but I would never return. Its not so good that I need to be treated like they're doing me a favor by allowing me to eat their food.

Things are definitely cozy in here during the peak dinner hour--lots of people at lots of tiny tables--but the lively, warm atmosphere was just right on a chilly, dark night.  

The pizza was fantastic--I went with the house special, the Pizza Rustica.  The crispy thin crust, fresh ingredients, and general non-greasiness reminded me of pizzas I ate in Rome.  Since we had a huge calamari appetizer (it was pretty good; not the best I've ever had) and each ordered our own pizza, SK and I thought we'd be carrying out some leftovers.  ....oops.  Didn't happen. 

This place hits a nice balance of being both trendyish--crowded, lively, lots of young, sophisticated urbanites out mingling--and warm, comfortable, and pretty reasonably priced.  Would definitely go back, but....to have the same thing, or try something new?

As for the fries - slightly better but only barely - a bit greasy and for some reason the portion was for a very small child - roughly 20-30 fries.... just about covered the bottom third of the carton.... hmmm.... for the price they charge... I think they should be gold plated...!

11946,3,1547856000000,"So I'm a little up in the air about this place... so I'll break it down. I gave it 4 stars cause the things I did like I really liked. And my husband and I still had a nice time together. 
Noise- on a Saturday night it is very loud. I can't speak to other nights or how the noise level on the patio was but from the looks of it the patio seemed quieter and seats more spread out.  Based on other reviews I went with the expectation for a romantic night out. It was romantic but it was loud as the tables inside are close to each other and we were unfortunately seated next to an obnoxious group of four.
Ambiance - Dimly lit, seems to be a nice patio. Romantic. But close to neighbours, hard to have a personal conversation.
Food - Delicious. Well, the appetizers I really enjoyed. We got the buratta and the bone marrow. Both were delicious. I never had buratta before nor thought to roast grapes but it was creamy and mild and perfect. I thought the garlic bread with it was a bit odd combo but it's garlic bread... who doesn't love garlic bread! We also got the spaghetti and the fettuccini. Both were good but the fettuccini was Asian flavours. It was good but it wasn't what we were expecting. 
Service - staff was really nice and helpful. No complaints.

So this is my dilemma with the star ratings. If I can copy the buratta dish at home, I probably won't go back but chances are I can't... so I'd go back just for that and to try a few other items on the menu.",3

11959,1,1547942400000,"So... a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I was a fan of Hornsby's Cider... that is, until I started my love affair with craft beer. The number of 5 star Yelp reviews (Jeff S included) encouraged me to get off my butt and give this place a try. I was not prepared to have my mind blown like I did.

Red Clay Cider Works has a really ""tight"", uniformly themed, streamlined tap room; it just feels warm, comfy and cohesive. You feel like you've just come off the hiking trail up in the mountains and stopped in a ""cabin like"" bar. Love the boot print logo, which is even carried through to the cider flight carriers.
 
During my visit, RCC had 4 different ciders on tap, along with a couple of local beers and wine offerings. From the moment the Cherry Bobbin' Trolls (Sour Cherry Cider) hit my taste buds, I was won over. A slight sweetness, the perfect amount of tart and a nice crisp finish. Damn this stuff is good! The South End Sweet was very tasty but a bit heavy if you're going to have more than one glass. 

I have learned my lesson and will no longer hold the belief that cider is just an alternative for people who don't like beer or wine. The cider these guys make can definitely stand on its own!!

Who drips honey on chicken? :(  

Let's see what else sucked here... Oh, they spilled a bunch of syrup on the floor and then tried to wipe it up with a napkin... they brought out your food, and then a minute later--brought out your bill.  No one refilled our glasses of water.  And they ignored you the whole time... until they brought your bill out (so they could remind you to tip big :P).

11994,3,1547078400000,"Had a so so experience here. The good: portions are generous for tapas style, and prices are reasonable. The ham croquetas (3 per order) were nice and crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. Very little ham, mostly a (tasty) bechamel sauce filled the little balls. But still our favorite of the night. The bad: service is very scattered, the owner welcomed us and explained the menu (a good thing), but was a little too forceful in insisting we try certain dishes. We don't like beets, but he insisted we must have the beet salad, and that he would bring us a small free side dish of the salad we really wanted to get (which never came), but we must have the beets. So we got the beets lol. In his defense, it was pretty good, but again, we don't really like the texture or taste of that veg and we ended up leaving almost half uneaten and picking out the yummy goat cheese. The ultimate vibe I got from this place is that it has a bit of an identity crisis. The calamari dish we ordered had a sweet Thai chili sauce. Why??? The calamari was ok, not super crispy like I prefer, and probably would have garnered a 4/5 from me if it had a good sauce, but this way, 3/5 at most. The short rib poutine was probably my least favorite, 2/5 because 1)the fries were soft, lame, and unseasoned, and 2) again, with the ""inventive"" mixing of different cuisines, had kimchi mixed into the pulled short rib and gooey cheese (the last twp ingredients being good on their own). Why why why? We also had the pil pil shrimp, which were 8 small shrimp in a garlic sauce. It was good but not great, and this one really deserve some crusty bread to sop up all the garlic sauce. There is also a scotch egg dish listed on the menu in a nod to the chef's background, which also seemed out of place to me. Lastly, we had the raved about cauliflower with truffle oil. My dining partner liked it, I felt it was nothing special, not seasoned or fried enough. A few tweaks could have made this a good dish.
Cocktails should also be avoided here. They are affordable but really light on alcohol. Your best bet is a bottle or glass of wine. The pours are generous on those. I can see this place being popular for a date night, since it's fun to share a bunch of dishes and it's affordable and has a liquor license. With that said, something was too off for me to want to go back, and the identity crisis rubbed me the wrong way.",3
12000,1,1546732800000,"We had the most underwhelming $500 dinner in recent memory. Standard salad for my wife was left half finished. My Caesar Salad ranked in the bottom third of recent salads for me. We had a wagyu tenderloin and an angus ribeye. Both solid, but hardly worth $150 between them.  The ribeye was tasty, but not appreciably different from what I cook at home when I cook a prime cut. We tried the Broccolini, which was more stalks than tops. Mistake. The wine list is very pricey, and we had a bottle of Inglenook Cask Cabernet 2012. In stores, $60. Here, $180. 

Overall the bang for the buck does not justify a higher rating. You might say we walked away with a bad taste in our mouth.",2

They popped the top off and would say what they were (of course she could've said ""fried donkey ears"" in Chinese and I would'n't have known the difference)... my friend and I tried maybe 4 or 5 little dim-sum plates plus noodles for my friend and the bill was... gasp... 12 dollars total - yeah, SUPER cheap! 

I don't know what good or bad dim-sum is, but I know that this was filling, flavorful, priced well and when I googled what I ate later that night, my pics looked the same as those online.  Note that there was definitely a language barrier, but be patient.. they offer good service and you're definitely being served by hard-working staff.  I would return for dim-sum again here.",3

12008,1,1546992000000,"Was really stoked when I first heard of this place that you can create your own bubble tea! Since I am avid bubble tea enthusiast and love trying new places this place as was like a god send to finally be able to create your own drink without having to own a franchise or store of your own. 

After reading alot of other reviews I feel like other Yelper's are giving this place some skewed overview on what the actual business concept is suppose to be. Yes, the concept is to create your own concoction of bubble tea anyhow you wish with different kinds of flavors, powders and toppings. However, I feel that others compare this place too harshly to other bubble tea business which are obviously on a different level of taste, quality and authenticity. When people say this place make drinks tastes terrible and not strong enough or whatever, my reply is why can't y'all just enjoy the ""experience"" instead of comparing how your drink isn't up to par with other bubble teas places around the city. If your looking for a ""quality bubble tea"" then best to just go to a Chatime any other chain if you strongly feel this place isn't any good. 

Aside from all that, I actually enjoyed this place and it was pretty fun. I created myself a passion fruit, grape green tea =). The parts in picking and choosing your own flavors was really cool to see all the different flavors in syringes and lab tubes which was pretty unique and creative. The drink it self was a bit sweeter than what I normally have but the taste was there. Could really taste the grape that was mixed in with it as well as the passion fruit. Drink cost was around $5 something so average pricing. I came on a Wednesday and it was still pretty busy nearing 6 pm. Line was a bit long around 15 min wait time. Overall, fun experience and would come again to try other mixtures.",2

The whoopie pie, I could do without.  It was like $4 and just not worth it
   My only complaints are...they obviously are over priced..,they seem to not have stock of chips and sodas when I have gotten food from them...but maybe that is good consider how expensive the small bag of chips cost :). Lastly, I ordered for multiple people.  All food came in one bag and nothing was labeled....so here we had to open everything and dig around to see who's was who's.

12037,3,1547424000000,"Y E L P !!! My first restaurant comment after lurking the reviews for nearly a  year.

I was up for a late breakfast and really craved something along the lines of a family diner where I could sit at the counter, read my paper, sip my coffee, plan my day and feel comfortable in flip-flops, t-shirt and shorts. My  inbox showed that I had received the Weekly Yelp. A quick search found all of the usual haunts that I ride my bike to in my end of Scottsdale. I had some business in Tempe and narrowed my search to that area. Voila! Harlow's was the first listing. 

As a native, I have seen the various incarnations of this local establishment and heard all the raves, yet I never had the time or I wasn't in the area. Not today! I knew that it was almost always busy and figured since it was just me, a little wait wouldn't hurt.

When I arrived, the parking lot was half full. I parked, grabbed my paper and entered into exactly what I expected. Nothing fancy but a very comfortable interior that is inviting. It's roomier than it looks from the outside. Air conditioning was set to cool off anyone coming in from the 105 that had already settled in and was rising. I went to the empty counter and was greeted immediately by one of the many waitresses. She served my coffee and I never opened the menu and asked if I could just tell her what I wanted and she said, ""No problem."" 

The reviews said that the waitresses were cute and young and hot (true), but that is a disservice to how efficient and productive they are. They were all busy, all moving, all social and most importantly made everyone feel welcome. Even first time, old timers like me.

My food was fantastic, large portioned and prepared the way that I requested, but everybody has different likes and dislikes so I won't give any more review on food. 

Here's the kick-in-the-nuts part of my visit...

...after carefully planning where I was going, getting my paper and heading out to breakfast, I kept feeling that I had forgotten something. Hmmmmm, what could it be? Oh, well, off I go.

Still bothering me in the back of my head as I go to pay at the front register. Money clip left at home! Red-faced and kicking rocks, I approach the hostess and explain my plight, feeling like a two-bit bum without two-bits. Got any dishes you need washed? 

There was a manager (and I'm assuming owner) at the front as well and without skipping a beat, she takes the ticket from my hand and says, ""That's OK. We're open until 2pm. Just come on back when you get your money."" She was smiling and pleasant and never asked my name or phone or any details. She never hesitated. It's not like I'm a regular and they know where to find me. I offered to leave my cell phone as collateral, but she would not accept. Embarrassed, I went to my truck, determined to return as quickly as possible with my cash. 

Then I remembered that I keep a twenty in the truck for emergencies (like this one). Woo Hoo! I went right back in and thanked her for faith in humanity and vowed to return and tell my friends. 

It's rare these days to find that comfortable, small-town trust. We are, after all, the biggest little metropolis in the southwest.

Kudos to Harlow's for great food, quick and friendly service, personality  and a personal touch that went a long way with this customer.",2

12073,2,1547078400000,"Had dinner here during summerlicious.

We started off with the non-alcoholic cocktails which were fine, but nothing special (for 8 dollars, at least)

The bread basket was excellent, and they took care to warm the butter to make spreading it easier.

Both of us got the smoky cod as the appetizer. I felt that the balance of the dish was tilted too much towards the vegetables, which were a bit watery - perhaps because they did not strain the cabbage properly? Also, both the cod and the fritters could have used some more salt.

For the mains, we had the salmon dish, which was very close to perfection. For my taste, the cauliflower pieces could have been a bit more tender or crunchy, but overall the fish was excellent and the composition of the dish was very good. 

The low point of the meal was definitely the dessert. 
Unfortunately, the pastry chef completely misunderstood the Black Forest cake. As a European, I have a pretty good idea of what this dish should be about: the cherry is supposed to be a bit sour, and the cream light, to counterbalance the chocolate. In this slice of cake, there was no counterpoint. Just chocolate, and sugar all the way. I also felt that the cream was uneven: mostly very sweet, but there was one corner of the slice where it got somewhat less sweet and had more cherries - still not enough, though. 
The cheese and chocolate dessert was pretty good: the cheese was outstanding - my friend had most of it -, the jam was a bit too dense for my taste, and the chocolate could have used a tad more salt to make it more interesting. 

The dining space looks great, maybe the music was a bit too loud for a Tuesday evening.
The servers were all very attentive and professional.

All in all, if I compare this both to other $45 summerlicious dinners, or to other restaurants in the O&B franchise, I think they have some way to go - especially the pastry chef.

A pleasant experience, but not the summerlicious dinner that will have me back on other occasions.",2

12086,3,1548201600000,"Was at Pasta Bar last night with a friend for the first time.  The service was very good, as we were immediately seated.  The decor is pleasant and modern.  

Overall, my impression is that Pasta Bar was tasty but not cheap. It would be hard to get out of there for less than $20 per person. We had one glass of wine, one ""Mexican coke"" (I had to ask what it was - it's the old school sugar-cane flavored coke we used to get here in the 70s), and two pasta entrees at $15 each, and the total was $47. No dessert and no appetizer, although they give you these small tasteless bread sticks in a package gratis to snack on while waiting.  The food came out quickly, although they weren't the busiest on a Thursday night.  I had shell pasta that started with an ""O"" (can't remember the name now, but second from the bottom of the entrees menu) and sausage, and my dining companion had the gnocchi.  Both were tasty, and although I'm generally not a fan of gnocchi, it was really very good here.  

In terms of getting into the restaurant from the parking area in the back, could they make it any harder to find? I found it weird that you had to basically walk through an ASU parking lot to get to the side entrance, and then from there into the restaurant itself. 

Overall, I'd give it 3+ out of 5 stars, but the prices would deter me from going back for some time.",2

After being there for 2 hours I was done! I showed the owner and he apologized and offered to fix them but after 2 hours I didn't want to stay any longer and had both persons not been rushing then this wouldn't have even happened.

12119,1,1546300800000,"Relatively new karaoke downtown. I was initially very excited as it offered connection of the karaoke machine to an app on your phone on which you can choose the songs and adjust the list of chosen songs. I have seen it in Hong Kong and loved the system; with that, everyone can choose their songs on their phones without having to gather in front of the screen in the corner. The first time I was there, it kind of worked. The app kept crashing and deleting songs on its own, and you can't be connected to this system and to wifi at the same time, but at least it was there. Last time I went, I found out that it doesn't work anymore. We had to gather around the screen again. There are a lot of Chinese songs, but not enough English songs, especially the recent ones. Update definitely needed.

The staff is like the typical KTV staff in Montreal, not very friendly, but still helpful if you need them. The price is average and include a drink. The sound system is pretty good.

12126,1,1548201600000,"While I appreciate the addition of a sushi restaurant out here in Goodyear, I must say that I'd just rather drive to Westgate and eat at Be Sushi if I want sushi. 

My husband and I dropped in for a quick dinner the other day before grocery shopping. He can't eat much fish at all, so he ordered some gyoza and a tempura shrimp roll. He enjoyed his food, but I tasted the gyoza and it was more deep fried than pan fried, which I did not like. 

I had the spicy tuna roll and the veggie tempura. The tuna roll was fine - not bad, but not notably good. The tempura was good, and I was surprised (and pleased) to find eggplant among the veggie-ness.

The water they served us was horrendous. I generally just like water with sushi, unless I am drinking a beer (which I wasn't in the mood for that night). I had to order an iced-tea to get the horrible taste of the water out of my mouth.

The only other criticism I have for the place is that their servingware looks like, well, hand-me-downs. I kept thinking, 'Didn't this place just recently open?'

I LOVE Nicole; the amazing woman who greets me every time I visit (I can't wait to see her again!). She remembered me and my sister when we returned. She even remembered specific products we liked and ordered from our last visit. I felt so special. She really cares!!!

Elizabeth is the best Esthetician I have ever had the pleasure of receiving a facial from; EVER!!! She is so knowledgeable about her field. She is also truly concerned about your facial needs not just what you think you want. She makes sure the facial you're going to get is what you need (i.e. she ensures you won't get a procedure that is too harsh or ineffective). No other esthetician has ever done that (at any other spa). 

Jose gave me the most relaxing and amazing massage in the world. He relaxed my entire body without any pain! I don't know how he did it, but I slept HARD the night I came back to my room from his massage. When I said medium pressure he knew EXACTLY what I meant and gave me just that; it felt perfect! I usually have a female massage therapist, but now I'm wondering 'why'? All male therapists from now on!!! He was very professional and kind. I say this because it is common for ladies to be nervous about letting a man massage them; I was. Well I discovered that there was no need to be nervous with Jose! 

This Spa is top of the line. The staff is professional, caring and courteous. The facility is immaculate. The ambience is serene. 

This is my absolute favorite Spa, to date!!!

12143,3,1548806400000,"Food was not as amazing as I would have expected based on some of the other reviews. It was 3 star at best. 

What ruined the experience for me was the service. When ordering hot tea for one person they give one teapot and charge for one tea. When ordering hot tea for 4 people, they give you one pot and charge for 4 teas. When confronted about this we were ignored. 

When we tried to order more food we waited for the waiter for 15 min before we decided to raise our hands to get their attention. That didn't work and we tried to call for the waiter which didn't work also. I eventually had to get up and approach one of the waiters which I think is unacceptable for any restaurant with waiters.

When we got the bill they had already put on a 20% tip. I would have been ok with this if we had gotten service worthy of that much tip. I am unashamed to say that I left enough cash to cover 10%, which is generous relative to the service received that night.

Several items tasted very similar like the green vegetable pan fried dumpling, siu mai, mushroom siu mai, pan fried dumplings - all same or very similar filling. Just get one of those. The star was the Cheung fun very thin yet glutinous nice flavor with the bbq pork. Reasonable pricing. Would like to see some creativity and different offerings.

12176,3,1548288000000,"Let me start this review with the service. We had Ms. Monroe as our server she was informative and pleasant. I mentioned it was national prime rib day and she told us because we mentioned it we would get a free prime rib upgrade. Nice. We started with the artichoke hearts fried with 2 dipping sauces. They were pretty good. Then we had the spinning salad meh it was ok. We added the Lawry's seasoned pepper as Ms.Monroe suggested. It did give it some extra flavor. The wait between courses was perfect. So I upgraded my potatoes to the special Yukon gold mash,glad I did my husband stuck with the regular mash and mine were much better. The creamed corn was the best I've ever had. The popover was also pretty good. So you may be wondering why only 3 stars? The Prime rib was pretty much the worst I have ever had, and I love prime rib. Gold Coast, South point, Both have better prime rib for a lot less money. It had no flavor, we asked for medium which was blood red. So we went for medium well. Which was still pink so it should not have been like chewing on gum. Tasteless gum at that. You would think that a seasoning brand restaurant would have some very well seasoned beef. My husband got the diamond Jim cut. Had a crust with no flavor. What? How can this be. We did not join the club. We will not be returning. To many better less expensive places to go. But we were impressed with the service and the side dishes.",2

The restaurant doesn't want to accommodate larger groups (like 7) and doesn't want to turn on the heaters on the patio when it's cold out. It's just a weird vibe, not fun and relaxing like before.

12187,1,1548720000000,"Very nice if it is just the 2 of you.

The suites do not have more than one bed (the pullout sofa bed does not count).  The pullout bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have ever slept on.  You would think that a place with the name Trump on it would invest in more comfortable sofa beds, especially in a city where more than two people usually share a room.  

They do however try to accommodate you by bringing up extra cushioning for the bed but it does not help, you can still feel the metal bars digging in strange places of your body while trying to lay down. Which therefore makes it impossible to fall asleep, unless you're blackout drunk.

The rooms however are so nice and the bathrooms are fancy as all get up.  The rooms have kitchenettes (Trump was actually going to make these condo's before turning it into a hotel) and the bathrooms have little TVs.

The location of the hotel is right after the Wynn and right before old school vegas starts (i.e.  the sahara, fremont street, stratosphere, etc.). In other words, ONE HELL OF A WALK.

There is no casino here which makes this very classy and less noisy.  The elevators are extremely fast which can make you kind of woozy if you are inebriated.

PLEASE TRY THE CLUB SANDWICH AT THE POOL CAFE! It is so delicious!!

It is one fancy, classy, beautiful hotel.",2

The menu is interesting and I enjoyed the taste adventure, but think some of the serving sizes are rather small for the price,  My spouse was hungry when we left.  We tried the Mozzarella Agedashi, which was good but not as flavorful as I'd hoped.  The meatloaf dish had a surprising and impressive presentation.  It had lovely flavors for the most part but I found it rather salty.  My spouse had the Crab Ravioli but as indicated, the serving was very small.  I shared about 1/3 of my meal with him because the risotto was pretty heavy for me but it still wasn't enough for him to feel satisfied.  

If you have a big appetite, I wouldn't suggest eating here.  I'd return with girlfriends though, as I enjoyed the wine and would give other menu items a try.",2

However, two things put me off... First is that they left my heavy wool sweaters on thin plastic hangers after they were done cleaning them. It's wool sweater 101 that you don't hang them, you fold them. Maybe my old dry cleaner was a superstar for doing this? Anyway, it gave them pocked shoulders which is frustrating, though they are definitely clean. But even a thick plastic hanger would have made all the difference. And second... don't give them your alterations. They made a beginner's mistake altering my jeans for back-gap, taking them in with two visible darts rather than in the hidden back seam as a more experienced tailor will do. But they're primarily a dry cleaner so I'll not dock them much for that. Overall good!",2
12216,3,1547424000000,"Very frugal with 5 stars,  this place was fantastic all around.   First off the rate was unbelievable for a fine hotel.  150  all in which is amazing.   They one me over with a complimentary early check in and late check out.  I was moving from the Flamingo and got there at noon,  no problem.   Next day had a late night flight out,  4 pm check out no problem. Most hotels are so stingy with either early in or late out,  this was astonishing.   They gave me a 40th floor with awesome desert and Casino views.   Rooms are spectacular and expansive.   Free Water,  great gym and nice pool area.   The spa at 20 per day has a steam room that is so hot you start detoxing and sweating once you step in.   No gambling or smoking which I think is a good marketing move,   there are plenty of those activities  a few minutes away on the strip.    This hotel is not for everyone so let me clarify,  although they provide a shuttle to Caesar's,  it is a bit away from the strip area.  Also the pool area is not like the massive pool areas that you would find at others.  The restaurant i didn't try and did not read many reviews for it.   But for me all future trips to Vegas will be at the Trump if  a similar rate can be acquired.",3

Chicken clay pot was good but again, too strong with herb flavors. The coconut was great, I love coconuts so it was great, nice and cold.

I love their warm, authentic mexican tortillas!  I usually always get a burrito, but every now and then I get a chicken taco from here too.

There are 3 things that make me very happy about this restaurant:  1) you can custom design the ingredients of your burrito, and it still stays cheap;  2) their chicken is shredded and marinated with a light broth, which keeps the chicken meat moist and tender;  and  3) I like their self serve salsa bar, lots of variety of add ons:  sliced radishes, cilantro, onions, jalepeno & carrot mix, limes, green onions, and even diced cucumbers.

12261,3,1546387200000,"The first time I heard about Nirvana 2 was from a colleague of mine who loves Indian cuisine. Now growing up in a family of Indian chefs and doing my own Indian cooking there was only one restaurant that I like to visit and that was the Rajbhoj in the university area. When  I first went to check out Nirvana 2 I was pleasantly surprised to see that the owner was also a chef at Lolas making the lolas beef tips. If anyone has ever tasted the Lolas beef tips it is also close as you get to original Portuguese cuisine.

Now about Nirvana 2;- it is more about carrying out than dining in. Once you set that expectation you would be fine. Another thing to keep in mind is that not all Indian food is spicy. Anything that involves cream will be bland for the most part. What the reader Avi A said about the food being bland;- any lentils or korma will always have some blandness associated for it. If you want something with a flavor and a kick here are some options;-

Chilli chicken
Pepper Chicken
Any south Indian chicken
Curry fish - Yes this is really good

For you non vegetarians;-

Chama masalla
Any peas and mushroom combinations
Any kadai combinations

The coconut chicken is also good but dont expect it to be spicy.

The staff is very friendly and they do take feedback. So if you have to say something tell them. It will only help improve their cusine. My mama always told me that if you dont have something nie to say dont say it all. And if someone doesnt like the food they can always cook at home =(^-^)=!",2

The mainstays are Alpine Vanilla (my personal favorite), Chocolate, Strawberry, Taro, Original, Cookies & Cream and Mango, while the seasonal options include Banana, Honeydew, Pear, Watermelon and a few more.

They have two cup options, medium and large at $0.41/oz and moderate topping options - sprinkles, gummies, yogurt chips, brownie bites and fresh fruits (yes not frozen) - strawberries, mango, kiwi, grapes (maybe 1 or 2 more). It is self serve - which is awesome as you can choose how much you want)

It is a small to medium restaurant, I would call ahead if you have more than a few people in your party. We had a ravioli dish, a cheesy bread, an antipasta salad, and several pizzas. Firstly, my sister ate the raviolis, I didn't. She finished it and commented that she was enjoying it, and between her and her infant, they ate it all. The cheesy bread was just that, ok bread with a lot of margarine (it just did not seem like butter to me! Or Olive oil for that matter) and a good amount of mozzarella cheese. The cheesy bread has quite a bit of room to improve. Good quality bread, butter or olive oil, and herbs (dried or fresh) would do a lot for the dish.  The antipasta salad was ok. The iceburg lettuce was shredded, which makes me think they are using this lettuce for both the sandwiches and the salads. While I appreciate the business side of that, I found the somewhat dry, shredded lettuce just didn't work to make the salad satisfying. The other parts of the salad, the meats, olives, a few sparse veggies were good, but not plentiful. Overall, we loved the service and the pizza.

This is an award winning restaurant group that has had the honor of cooking at the James Beard House. There are several locations of this restaurant across the U.S.A. and one in Naples. Ocean Primes are usually located in upscale and or resort sort of areas. This Ocean Prime is located on High Street by the Desert Ridge Marketplace.

My review is only based on one brunch visit. I thought it was GREAT that Ocean Prime was offering a reasonably priced Brunch. It's just so nice to go to a really nice restaurant every now and then. Most really nice places offer brunches on holidays that are so expensive. Not Ocean Prime....Their brunch is quality and very reasonable. 

We arrived and were greeted by a few people at the hostess desk that welcomed us and took us to our table. I noticed a reserved sign on a table that read ""Reserved For Angelina Jolie"" and for a minute I thought gosh, Is Angelina Jolie on her way to Phoenix?....NO it was sort of a joke. My table had a sign that read ""Reserved For Bette Davis.""....so funny LOL. 

Our table was nice and set with crisp linen, sparkling glassware and shiny silverware. The dining room is sort of classic and rich with leather and dark wood. But they also have modern bright features that round things out.

I ordered the Blackened Salmon Salad. I got a good sized piece of nicely spiced and crisp salmon cooked to a perfect medium. The fish seemed like it was very fresh and had a great texture that just melted in my mouth. On the side was a fresh mixed green salad adorned with creamy goat cheese, cantaloupe, candied walnuts and sweet grapes. It was just the right size for brunch.

My husband had the Crab Cakes with Poached Eggs topped with Hollandaise Sauce. His plate also came with fresh fruit and a side salad. The grilled crab cakes were very good...much better than from most places.....It's very hard to get a good crab cake outside of Baltimore. The rest of his plate was good but not perfect....The plate sat under a heat lamp and the salad and fruit were warm. Eggs and sauce seemed slightly cooked by the lamp. We might have told our waiter if he checked on us but he didn't. 

We also shared the side of Black Truffle Mac and Cheese. It was a great portion for sharing. It had nicely prepared pasta in a creamy, cheesy sauce with pieces of real truffle. We both thought if was excellent for the price point.

Now, my family and I like Spicy, but knowing Thai cooking the way I do, I was like, ""WHOA!.  If this was Medium, what on Earth would they consider Spicy?"" While I was able to eat it, my family was not. :( And, knowing what the next day or two will cost me, I ended up throwing the rest of it out. :( A shame to spend $$ on something that had to be thrown out.

Bread was fresh but fell apart, small tomato slices , 1 limp green lettuce leaf, few red onion slices and a schmear of their ""sauce"". Pretty sloppily made, but the kicker was the wad of turkey tendon. Grossed me out totally. The other turkey pieces were pretty tasty and moist, just not enough turkey. The sandwich was primarily bread. The drive through was on the slow side, took 10 minutes after ordering with one single lady ahead of me. I'll give them another try but can't imagine having the turkey again. Yuk. UPDATE Went back to drive thru for breakfast on way to work, asked for  egg sandwich on sourdough toast, got the greasiest grilled sourdough sandwich that was barely grilled and it had such an off, metallic taste that it was not edible. How hard is it to make TOAST? I can't believe anyone has had a good experience at this place. Needs new management and new cooks. Not going to bother again.",2

 It's fun to see the colourful light patterns and hear music from the museum below. 

Service is attentive. Plates are beautifully presented (the Chef is the Grandson of a painter). The food is very good. Nothing fancy or exotic, but really delicious. The wine list is interesting, with a good choice of wines by the glass, decently priced.

12368,1,1547856000000,"McRamyun is a Korean fusion restaurant with a itty bitty patio on the outside, on the corner of the infamous Baldwin street. I came here, after a friend's wedding ceremony, and was starving. We sat on the patio, which meant we couldn't be served alcohol.

Ordered the wings to share, and I ordered a Duen something Ramyun, which was the soft tofu broth, and added on 2 pieces of pork belly for $2.95. The wings came, but they mistakenly gave us the McWings instead of normal wings. McWings is their ""specialty"", which is covered in crushed dried noodles. We'd already dug in, so they graciously put normal wings on the bill instead. These wings were delicious!

The ramyun itself was just ok. The broth was spicy, and the noodles were just...noodles. Pork belly seemed dry and none of that fatty goodness. Overall, the ramyun cost about $15, which did not seem worth the money.

I would come back for the wings, but in my mind, the ramyun was just a 2 star.",2

I looked up places on-line and came across either glaze craze or your fired and there was a better rating for glaze craze and that it was cheaper. Being on a student budget, we opted for glaze craze. Plus there was a $10 coupon off via Yelp so that made things even cheaper! 
When we got there, the place was small but homey. Service was great, everyone was very friendly. There wasn't much that I wanted to paint but eventually tried this dish that I figured could be used for jewellery. My boyfriend went for iron man. It was very fun, we spent almost two hours there just chatting and enjoying the time. It wasn't too busy there so that was nice. There are a bunch of colours and overall was a very nice experience.

12387,2,1546560000000,"I had to run out of the office to fill my gas tank and across the street was The Original Hoagie Shop. I decided to give them a try since it was convenient. I even quickly checked their Yelp rating and saw the 4 star rating, so I felt it was a safe bet.

The place was quite small and a bit dingy feeling. I didn't smell anything, which was surprising. I guess I was expecting to smell either baked bread, or the spices from the different hot sandwiches they offer, or something. I wanted to leave but felt I didn't have much time to go elsewhere so I stayed and ordered the cheese steak sandwich. Most places that offer cheese steak sandwiches usually have onions so I was surprised to find out I would need to add them on. I paid and waited...and waited...and waited. Finally! I got my sandwich and I headed back to work since I was running behind now.

When I got back to work is when I realized they charged me extra for mushrooms but they didn't bother to let me know there would be an up charge for it. The total came to $8.18, I thought whatever, as long as it tastes good I'll be fine with it. 
I was very disappointed. The sandwich was absolutely flavorless! No tomato, or lettuce, no mayo, or malt vinegar, nothing was on it. It was just cooked chopped meat, with a little bit of onions, a few mushrooms pieces, and some cheese. This was not worth the money, not even close. I am so disappointed I wasted my money...

I definitely won't be back, I didn't think it was worth the $8 bucks by any means. I would suggest going to Forefather's Cheese Steaks off of Priest and Warner. They're flavorful, they have lots of options to choose from, very clean place with happy staff. For the price I paid for JUST a sandwich by itself I could have gotten a sandwich, fries, and a drink at Forefathers. How sad is that!?",2

The restaurant was pretty packed as we entered. As we were seated, I noticed that we were not handed a menu. So we sat and waited about 15 minutes before being given a menu. We were basically left to sit in the corner for about an additional 20 minutes. I was a little confused as to why things were taking so long. I mean the reviews on Yelp were really good. The customer service I found was extremely lacking, as our order was taken the waitress walked off and had not asked us if we wanted anything to drink. So I had to ask her myself. I told her that me & my sister wanted water and she returned 5 minutes later with bottle water (which a glass of free water would have been sufficient) The food took a while to come which did not surprise me at this point. The food was good not GREAT!!! The portion was large which is probably the only reason I gave them 2 stars. After we finished our meal, we could have basically walked out of the restaurant, I doubt they would have noticed anyways with the way things were going. I walked up to the counter and stood in front of the cashier to pay my bill. She took her sweet time and didn't even realize I was there until one of her co-workers pointed it out to her. From here it took her about 5 minutes to hand me my bill and change. She did not even say thank you when she gave me my change. No tip was given obviously.

12416,2,1548892800000,"Really wanted to like this place as it's 5 minutes away and would have been nice to have a place this close to go to for my Vietnamese fix 3-5 times a week.   It wasn't meant to be though.  The food here is at best, average but closer to bland.  Had the PHO with Steak and meatballs and an order of Vegetarian Summer Rolls.  There was no option to get Brisket as a choice.  PHO portion was very small, especially for the price $7.99.  Barely any noodles in it.  The broth was also a little too sweet.   I finished the entire bowl and all of the soup because I was really hungry, and wasn't completely full after that, a first of PHO.

The summer rolls (spring rolls) didn't actually come with any protein so we asked them to put some steamed Tofu too.  15 minutes later (not an exaggeration), we got the summer rolls with the pre-fried tofu that comes pre made in packs.  They also didn't include any of the normal vegetable filling that was suppose to come with it.  So basically rice paper, rice noddles (but not the thin vermicelli noddles) that were a little too thick, and lettuce / mint.  We had to wait another 10 minutes to get that.

When we got the bill. that's when we noticed they charged us extra for the tofu, with no mention of that before.  So basically it cost $20 with tip to get 1 small bowl of Pho and one order of vegetarian summer rolls.  Well be skipping this eating option, thankfully there are a lot of options around here.  If the prices were reasonable, this place would be a 3 star  place, but for the price premium, not worth it.

The staff there truly loves animals, and they treat the dogs with compassion and respect. My dog is a rescue, and Pete and Mac's has had a huge hand in his rehabilitation.  He has gone from being timid and wary to being a happy and confident dog, and much of the difference in his behavior can be traced back to when I began to take him to Pete and Mac's for daycare.  They also reinforce the training he gets at home, so he has remained as obedient as ever--perhaps he is even better behaved because of his time there.  I'm also a firm believer that a tired dog is a good dog.  He gets lots of play time and attention when he is there, so on the days I have long working hours, I know he is getting the exercise he needs.

What makes it even better is that I board him at Pete and Mac's when I travel.  He is so familiar with the staff and feels so loved there that he has minimum anxiety while I'm gone.  On his pick-up day, the groomer gives him a bath that leaves him clean, fluffy, and good smelling.

Cons: They do not accept credit cards for purchases less than $20. 
The place gets just too crowded on weekends.
The veggies are generally more expensive than what you will find in grocery stores like No Frills or Fresh Co.

Jean Geaorges' Prime is essentially a perfect steakhouse. Maybe not the best but you'd be hard pressed to find much area for improvement. The setting is elegant. The service professional without being stuffy. The cheapest cuts are great. The expensive cut are heavenly. You can easily drop over $200 for a specialty cut... a la carte! Well worth it though.

All the sides are as they should be: creamed spinach, sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes, etc. The wine list is legitimate. If I were forced to find a flaw it would be in their sauces.

CASH ONLY!!! No cards of any kind, and the last time I was there (June 2008) the guy was abrupt and rude, probably because he is choked about his failing business.

Old newspapers, used plastic utensils, etc etc litter some of the tables even though the place is empty and the guy is just sitting behind the counter doing nothing. No music, no ambience, the only sound to break the silence was a snowy 1980s TV turned to channel whatever.

Upon entrance, you're greeted by the owners (always a plus!) & all you see is a gorgeous room with aesthetic colors & furniture! It's not your ""typical"" salon with bulky leather massage chairs. Instead they have comfortable, white fabric arm chairs. While getting a manicure, you sit on a velvety soft & comfortable decorative chair.

They also offer coffee (Keurig), snacks & beverages to their clients. 

Jenny, the owner, did a classic mani/pedi on me. She was gentle, easy to talk to & didn't pressure me into any ""add-ons"" like you get at most shops. My absolute favorite feature (because I'm somewhat of a germophob) is the way their conduct their pedicures. They don't use sinks! They use bins with DISPOSABLE liners. I have never been to a shop that does this! They truly care about their clients.

The staff are friendly and courteous. More importantly they actually had really good service. I'm mean fantastic. 

Ordered a pound of wings and fries. It's served with a yummy dill dip which I really enjoy and always have. About two years ago when I ate at St. Louis more often, they would only give you one dill dip. I always bought an extra one. 

After 10 mins or so, the food arrived freshly cooked. I noticed that the portion sizes are much smaller than they used to be. I also found that their portion of fries were also much smaller. On a positive note, they provided 2 dill sauces. The wings were tasty but a little over sauces in my opinion. They were definitely less meaty than they used to be. The fries were on the soggier side which I didn't enjoy very much as they are better served when fully cooked. 

What stuck out to me the most is that their pound of wings now cost $13 and change. 

They're almost 2-3 $$$ more than they were!

I'm sorry but if you're going to decrease the portion sizes and increase the price, that formula doesn't work for me, and I won't be returning. 

The math: walked out paying almost $22 for a pound of wings and a Diet Coke (tip and taxes included). 

That's insane.",2

With an upscale feel, a variety of food and drink options, the newest movie selection, and most notably, comfortable and reclining seats, this is usually our first choice of theaters to visit when we can find time to see a movie.

I've seen kids movies and adult movies at this theater, and I've had overall positive experiences every time.  I typically purchase my tickets to this theater through the flixster / fandango app, and looking back on my purchases alone, I can't believe how many movies I've seen here.

From Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Kubo, Pete's Dragon, Spider Man, and The Emoji Movie (with the kids) to The Girl on the Train, Loving, Jackie, The Big Sick, and Battle of the Sexes (with my husband and sometimes other friends/family), I guess I have spent a decent amount of $$ at this theater, and I'll likely continue to do so whenever the opportunity arises.

The drinks were mediocre at best. I got an aperol spritz that wasn't very sparkly and watered down.

I enjoyed the apps but when it came to the rest of the meal, Including this dish the waitress highly recommended I wasn't appeased. I was actually hungry after too, and got a treat at another hotel.

12617,2,1548547200000,"Multiple trips to date for the hotel. Once last year and once this year. Visits left a variable unfavorable hotel and casino impression.

Located in the center of the Las Vegas strip. One of the original casino and hotels. Mostly remodeled rooms with dark colored hardwood floors. Beds are decently maintained.

First visit last year, we stayed during spring break. Management and counter staff were both uncoordinated to handle the volume of people in line. Wait time was about a good hour from back to front for the players line or just hotel guest line. At one point the management had pulled me to the side to try out the self check in only to say I had to go back into the line. Fortunately enough the person I was in front of let me back into the line.

My room preference (king nonsmoking) was unavailable when I got to the check in after staying at another casino hotel the night before without having my nonsmoking preference available. Offered two queens nonsmoking we gladly accepted. Room was nicely furnished with pink fur, pillows, a nice little split love seat chairs. Bathroom was properly sized and decently maintained. The room was quite nice for what I expected to  find and sitting in front of the strip. Room was kept nicely by the hotel housekeeping. Only downside to the view and room was the large Donnie and Marie advertising that was outside obstructed the view of Caesar and the strip.

We received our bill the last morning to encounter an issue with billing. We waited in the hotel line again to get the issue resolved. Another good 15 minutes to check out. We had to catch our shuttle and correcting the billing was a contributing factor for is to miss our shuttle. We asked the hotel staff regarding catching the shuttle to which we purchased a round trip to where we would go. The staff was unsure. The long line with the lack of clarity between the staff was not a good lasting impression. Although not favorable on service I was willing to give it another try recently. 

Recent visit in July, I wanted to see if I could check in before normal time of 4. I didn't want to pay the extra for the early check in (breakfast time) but willing to pay for the room upgrade. We waited in line and this time was significantly faster but still about 15 minutes. Neither of my requests could be accommodated and was told to try back a little after lunch from the clerk and her supervisor. We wait again in the line and at the time we were told to check back again. This time another half hour of my time. Again I could not check in. We had already eaten lunch and breakfast by this time. We were told to check in an hour and decided to just wait for regular check in at this point. We come back go check in at 4. Waited another 15 minutes in line to get room keys and everything settled. So for check in here expect to wait about one hour.

Room this recent trip was not nearly as maintained. It looked like the room itself was half updated and the casino hotel ran out of money to fix it up. The room was comfortable but decor appeared to be mismatched from the tables and the bed. This recent trip we cut short and checked out a day early. Again check out took about 15 minutes.

Water and room temperatures were okay. Towels and sheets were cleaned and stocked. 

The decor and upkeep on the hotel was a mixed bag. Service is incredibly slow on the hotel front desk.

Casino is also not kept well. Considering the age and the keep of the room, an update is needed on both. Machines are tight and table dealers are not friendly or helpful. 

Overall I have to drop what would be a two star for a one time visit. Second trips usually confirm assessments. In this case, one star unlikely to be out here to stay the night or gamble. I'll take my business elsewhere.",1

If we hadn't had dinner reservations that night we would have tried much more since the pub smelled amazing as the cooks prepped for the dinner crowd.

I wish we went a little earlier so we could have done a little more exploring but we found a short trail to go on that brought us back before sunset. 

The Lost Creek Trail is an easy to moderate trail that will take you up to 30 min to an hour to complete. This is also a good trail for kids ....I didn't bring any with me but there were plenty of them running around. I thought if they can do it then I can do it! I'm not much of a hiker but I do enjoy nature sometimes. There is also a seasonal waterfall at the end of the trail that was really cool. You don't have to torture yourself through miles and miles to see it either. I would suggest wearing shoes with better traction then Etnies. I was doing okay until I slid on my butt on my way back down from the trail. Right before that very moment my husband asked if I was getting a feel for how to get around the rocks...looking up at him ..I said, ""not really"".

We sat at the bar and ordered a couple drinks while we waited for friends to arrive. I observed newly arriving customers eyeing the different tables, just like we were, to see who might leave next. So, when it's busy, and if you're not a little aggressive and watchful, you won't get a table for a while. I could see the ordering process, whereby you walk along the ingredients section and order your custom or specialty one-sized pizza, bruschetta, etc. We watched from the bar for about 20 minutes and were then able to get a table. 

We really enjoyed the taste of our pizzas. One complaint is in the way it's served: on a plate, which allows moisture to collect under the pizza, making the center 1/4 of the pizza crust soggy. This may be due to the close timing of the delivery of our bruschetta, and then our pizza. The pizza sat for a few minutes while we finished our bruschetta.

I've read stories of chemicals that dry out your hair so I was happy to feel how smooth my hair was after the treatment.  She recommended not washing it for several days after to allow it to set.

12781,3,1546560000000,"Despite the ""Vegetarian"" listing and name here on Yelp, Green Lotus markets itself as a vegan restaurant. Before you even enter the door, they have printed on their window-front: ""Vegan Cuisine,"" ""No Animal Product,"" ""No Dairy, No Egg."" Next door to Green Lotus is Pho Bamboo, which not a veg*n restaurant. They have the same owner and once inside, the two restaurants are only separated by a partial wall, so you can walk back and forth between the two. That being said, they share the same kitchen, which is located on Pho Bamboo's side. 

A group of us came here last Thursday for the Veg-Curious Night Out UYE.  This was my first time here. I did my research ahead of time so I knew that there were 2 vegan menus: 1 American menu; 1 Vietnamese menu.  Both menus are said to be 100% vegan, but the Vietnamese menu is more extensive. (I took photos of all pages on both menus; see photos.) If you ""appear"" to be non-Vietnamese, you will receive the American menu. (And believe me, you'll be missing out.) So I asked our waiter for both menus and he was happy to oblige, although it appeared that he may have been scolded by an older woman (owner?) for doing so.  She then came over and asked one of my buddies if he was Vietnamese, to which he replied no.  She appeared to try to take away our Vietnamese menus. I told her that I'd requested both menus. She just smiled and nodded her head (her English is limited), still holding out her hand out for the menus.  I held tightly onto mine, but she took the rest. Why do they have 2 different menus? The Vietnamese menu still has English descriptions for every entry, so that perplexes me. Upon further inspection, I did discover that some of the dishes in the Vietnamese menu were cheaper than its American counterpart. e.g. Com Chien Thap Cam (Combination fried rice), Com Chien Thai (Thai fried rice), and Com Chien Thom (Pineapple fried rice) are all $8.95 in the Vietnamese menu.  In the American menu, Thai fried rice is $9.95, Pineapple fried rice is $10.95, and Combination fried rice is $11.95. That's up to a $3 difference. Now in all fairness, there could be a reason. Maybe the American menu offers a larger portion, because...ya know, Americans?  I will dig deeper into this and report back. 

KING EGG ROLLS $5.95 - American menu. Comes with 3 large & crispy ""egg"" rolls, filled with veggies and tofu.  It came with thin light brown/yellow sauce that did not taste like sweet and sour sauce.  Another mate had ordered the crispy Pub Wontons (Vietnamese menu), which came with a red sweet & sour sauce. I think that sauce would've been better.  The egg rolls themselves were cool, but I'm a sauce person; the sauce is just as important, if not more, for me.

GA RAM $5.95 - Vietnamese menu. Fried soy chicken appetizer.  It reminded me more of vegan shrimp than faux chicken. It had a wiggly consistency. The flavor was ok, but I couldn't get pass the texture. 

CA MUOI XA CHIEN $8.95 - Vietnamese menu. Marinated soy fish deep fried with spicy lemongrass.  The dish had great flavor but the soy fish did not appear to be deep fried at all. Pan fried, maybe, but not deep fried. Also, there was no hint of the lemongrass flavor. This dish came with jalapeños, minimal broccoli (maybe 2 pieces), green bell peppers, and onions, served with jasmine rice. Again, yummy dish, just not what I expected.

RAU THAP CAM XAO GUNG $9.95 - Vietnamese menu. Fried ginger ""chicken"" with mixed vegetables.  By this dish, I've discovered that when they say fried, they mean stir fried. Served with jalapeños, green bell peppers, onions, and ginger. Served with jasmine rice. This dish was also very good and flavorful. I requested spice level 4 (on a 1-5 scale), but it was not spicy at all.

HOT & SPICY GREEN BEAN $9.95 w/ Soy Chicken + $2 - American menu. It's supposed to be sautéed in a chili paste. I requested spice level 4. It only had a hint of spice. Maybe they gave me the American spice scale instead of a real spice scale? Nonetheless, excellent dish that bursts with flavor.  It came with mushrooms, which was not mentioned in the menu description. I dislike mushrooms, so I had to pick those out, which is a shame; I hate wasting food. Served with brown rice.

VEGETABLE FRIED RICE $9.95 w/  Soy Chicken +2 - American menu. Excellent flavor in this dish as well. It comes with lots of green onions, which I love.

PROBLEMS! One of my dinner mates ordered the Vegetable Pho (Vietnamese menu) and was served REAL MEAT! How can this happen? Because as I said earlier, it shares a kitchen with its neighbor, Pho Bamboo. For this reason, I have a major problem with this establishment marketing itself as a vegan restaurant.  

When vegans see the ""vegan"" label on an eatery, we eat there knowing rest assured, we'll be served a 100% animal and animal by-product free meal. That security is false at Green Lotus. Aside from investigating further, I won't return to Green Lotus unless they become completely independent from Pho Bamboo.",1

Wow, impressed with the fact that a simple phone call yesterday with an explanation of the different models and what best fit our needs was all it took.

12808,1,1548892800000,"Alright, I'll be honest. I'd been wanting to come to Mesa Grill ever since I saw that one episode of Best Thing I Ever Ate where the tiger shrimp corn tamales were featured. So when my boyfriend and I were about to head back home from our anniversary vacation I just had to get over to Mesa Grill to try that dish, and wow.. it was so good I'm STILL thinking about it a whole 11 hours later. If you love a creamy, buttery dish full of corn and shrimp, you will be a happy person. I cleaned my whole plate. Though they only give you around 4 shrimps, you will still be happy because of the yummy sauce you can dip your complimentary bread into, and the masa, which I could seriously eat bowls of. My boyfriend ordered the blue corn pancake with bbq duck and he was very happy with it. I would definitely love to come back here again and try some more of Bobby Flay's yummy sounding dishes. I should also mention that we were seated promptly without a reservation, and our waiter was great.. knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, and helpful.

By the time another order arrived the couple we were with had nearly finished their dinner. We understand the occasional slip up but felt some compensation would have shown how much they value excellent customer service. Then our waiter seemed annoyed we asked to have the bill split two ways. We encountered that at another restaurant. Both times the server said he would have to get the manager to redo the bill.

12896,2,1547683200000,"Nice to see the old yardhouse space refreshed. This spot is promising but needs a few tweaks. 

Ordered cocktails and they came promptly. Between two of us we tried the following during the meal: 
Raisin rummy - easy to drink, vanilla notes, incredible aroma.

Old Besse - spicy with Ginger, fruity.
Black walnut Manhattan - my fave of the four, sweet aroma, medium bodied sipping cocktail. So much flavor.
Vonnegut - spicy, citrus, delicious.
Cocktails here are great and having been to parlor in the area I'd say this place is going to them a run for their money.

Food was pretty good but the prices here are all over the map. You can add cornbread to any order for $1.00 and it's delicious and muffin sized. For an appy we ordered the hush puppies which were $12.00 and classified under the ""Trays"" section of the menu. When they came out they were on a tray but in the tiniest basket and we got 8. We asked our waitress before we ate them if we had actually received what we thought we had ordered and asked if it was actually $12.00 and the waitress said yes. 

We saw a tray of chicken wings go out and there had to have been at least 10 wings on the tray and that was only $1.00 more than the hush puppies.

We also got the pulled chicken sandwich $10.00, and the 1/2 pound pulled pork $10, and the broccoli salad $4.00. All of that seemed a reasonable price to pay. Service was good but for the reaction to our question about the appy. 

We also saw the chips and queso head to another table and I'm pretty sure the menu had that listed as $13.00. I would say for what I saw that also seemed very overpriced.

Place has potential but it's getting a 3/5 for the major pricing issues on the menu. I'm hesitant to order anything else from the Trays menu. You'd be fine though if you ordered meat and sides and corn bread.",2

They only have a small handful of tables inside, and a few more outside in the mall.  The place was packed when we walked by and I looked at the food people at the edge were eating and it looked so good I told my friend ""We have to come back and try it tomorrow!""  We did, and after looking up the reviews I knew I had to try the meatballs.  I got spaghetti and meatballs and while the sauce on the pasta was a bit tangy for me, the meatballs were nothing short of superb.  They fall apart when you touch them with a fork and they absolutely melt in your mouth.

The chicken was a little tough and the sauce was overly heavy and sweet. Husband did like his pot roast a lot so they get an extra star for that.

12958,1,1547251200000,"I've now stayed here a total of three times, and have another visit booked for Labor Day weekend. I don't exactly understand the negative reviews, but as a Total Rewards member who plays at all of the Harrah's casinos, perhaps I am biased, since I feel I have been taken great care of at all of their hotels. 

Flamingo is not only on the strip, it's CENTER strip, so the location truly cannot be beat. Walking north to Venetian, or south to Planet Hollywood is easy, and crossing to Caesars is simple, too.

The one complaint I will concur with is the thin walls, which I noticed particularly on my February visit. We were in the room closest to the elevator on the 8th floor of the Spa Tower, and I heard that elevator dinging at all hours of the night and morning. I bought ear plugs on the first night because my boyfriend snores, so I didn't experience it in an overall sleep-disturbing way, however.

Parking has never been an issue for us here, but we typically stay Sunday-Wednesday. We've won money, lost money, eaten in the food court, checked out Margaritaville, and at the end of the day, this is still a very nice hotel. 

Here's my only concern about some of the negative reviews, and should serve as a warning to potential hotel guests: what the heck are you complaining about? You spend 8-10 hours in the room, most of which are with your EYES CLOSED. Who cares what the room looks like? And just join the Total Rewards club already, so you don't have to wait in that huge line to check-in.",2

Love the outer decor. Sailor Moon on the window? Score! Also, the inner decor is nice as well. It's much nicer than people are describing on here. I like to refer to it as asia-chic. IT's not traditional, but it's definitely japanese inspired. also, the pictures of anime on the wall are much more than some posters. they are high quality canvas print panels, and they also have j-pop playing in the background, with gundam anime on the two flatscreen TVs. The cute waitresses in colored wigs and fun outfits greet you in japanese, much like they do in japan (they do this for everyone who comes in, no matter what they happen to be doing at the time. It's really fun. they also thank you as you leave in the same manner.)

I ordered the tom-yum ramen, some hot tea, and honey toast. Hot tea was good- but i do agree with another reviewer, they need coffee mugs. The ramen was delicious. It was everything i love about ramen- greasy, delicious slurpable noodles, chicken chunks, and a spicy broth that really helped with my cold. Plus, the serving portion was huge.

When you can find a business located near work, it can be the best experience. NOT IN THIS CASE. All he wanted to do was have the soles of Timberlands repaired. He is no shoe expert,but he figured the soles just needed to be glued, so he left it up to this business that claims to fix shoes to tend to his needs. He dropped his shoes on a Tuesday and was told to pick them up Friday. Since he had prepaid $10 for an ""easy fix"", he return that Friday to retrieve his belongings. Looking back now, he realized he should have inspected his items a little more closely. NORMALLY, when you drop shoes at a cobbler they do the common courtesy of buffing your shoes after service. This was not done. There was glue everywhere the sole had been pasted. He returned to ask them to please buff it out and THEY REFUSED. He asked several times and they said no. He walked out in disbelief but decided his sanity was worth more than a disrespectful staff member. When he inspected the shoes more thoroughly at home, he realized that only a portion of the sole was glued down. WHO DOES THAT? He decided to return to the business, not even to complain, but to make them do the work that he paid for. Unfortunately, the next visit was just as ridiculous! He tried to explain to the man at the counter that the work wasn't done. The response? ""You only asked me to do the front.""(Last time I checked, the sole can run front to back of most shoes.) My friend said his look of shock should have straightened out the situation but to no avail. He again requested they do the work he paid for. The employee said for an additional cost he would do it. A woman who works there joined the fiasco. She even accused my friend of damaging the shoes again himself. I could write so much more about the back and forth that occurred, but I think you get the point. THEY HAVE NO CUSTOMER SERVICE and my friends shoes are not fixed.

12983,3,1548460800000,"My wife and I recently spent a week in Montreal and were happy to rely on public transportation so we didn't have to drive (or find new parking!) around the city.

The subway system is very easy to navigate and the wait for a train was never longer than 10 minutes. There are areas of town I wish it went to, but there are always a few bus lines leaving from each station. Speaking of which...

The buses are decent. Fail to catch one, however, and you could be stuck waiting another half hour. The STM prides boasts of some lines where you'll never wait longer then 10 minutes, but there aren't as many of those in my experience. So it gets annoying when the STM website says the bus will arrive in 10 minutes and when you arrive 4 minutes later, you see the bus pulling away. An early-arriving bus is just as problematic as one that arrives late.

For visitors like us, we looked for a weekly pass, but the kiosk didn't offer anything over 3 days, which was still a good deal for the amount that we used it - unlimited rides on buses and metro trains for $18.

As another reviewer put it, traffic makes driving a pain and the time difference negligible, so I recommend the STM, especially to those visiting from out of town.",2
12984,3,1547769600000,"The prices for Happy Hour are what brought us in. Waitress was rude, didn't put in our appetizer order and then disappeared. We had two separate servers check on us, asked about the appetizer again. Second server ensured she'd put it in. Asked the third server who checked in on us about the appetizer and it still hadn't been put in. The best part about all of this was that after someone checked on us we never saw the same person again. Had to flag someone else down for our check. With the amount we spent Friday night our customer service should have been better, especially since we enjoyed the food and were considering ordering more. Really didn't feel like tipping anyone as our original server was miserable and never showed up again and no one else really bothered to take care of us. Except the server we had to flag down at the end. We won't be back. Was considering actually asking for our money back as well. Oh I forgot to mention that it seemed as though the couple next to us had no server issues. Really hope this wasn't a case of discrimination.",2

We were looking for a casual place to dine and grab a cold beer. After reading a few reviews, we decide to give Native Grill a try.   Native Grill is your basic ""sports bar"".  It's is a nice size bar, with plenty of TV's. 

Native Grill offers various wing styles and flavors. On this visit we tried the Honey BBQ and the Asiago Parmesan Strippers, chicken bacon ranch flatbread, fried zucchini, and hamburger sliders.  I didn't particularly care for the chicken strippers or the sliders. The chicken strippers with drowned in sauce and the sliders were slightly overcooked and somewhat dry. However, the chicken bacon ranch flatbread and fried zucchini were delicious

The beer was cold and inexpensive, with a nice selection.  I think we may have caught the late evening Happy Hour.   Our waitress was polite and accommodating without being intrusive, and the service was good. I just wish the food was better.",2

13013,3,1547078400000,"The original bacon bar. This is where it all began.  So from the outside you can barely tell that it's a candy shop. That's how chic the decor is.  

Let me begin by telling you that they love to add hot peppers and weird spices to their candy and i love candy so I'm willing to give it a shot.

If you ask they'll give you samples of there most popular/weird treats.  Their famous bacon chocolate bar is really good, crunchy, and a hint of smoky. I really liked their old-fashion toffee. There's also a different kind where they added red hot peppers into the mix. Not really my type.  Their truffles are very exquisite. I'm in love with The Wink of a Rabbit. So smooth and I do love my white chocolate

The staff is very friendly here. One of the bartistas were making hot chocolate and they offered it to us for free so of course my brother and I tried it.  First sip: delicious. 5 seconds later ""holy crap! It's spicy!"" ""what a sick joke man"".  If only they didn't stir the hot chocolate with a supersized Big Red gum stick.

The prices is really up there but this isn't sn ordinary Godiva or See's so it shouldn't hurt to try new things and be adventurous.",2

I was extremely disappointed in my nails. I liked my toes until I realized the lady didn't put the coats on evenly so my toes didn't look that great either. $28 for a horrible gel mani and $22 for an uneven pedi. Nope! Won't be coming back.

Anahi was kind, patient, understanding, and she actually said she (or one of her staff) would watch him again. We also really appreciated the progress texts (with pics). The price (with Yelp discount and gratuity) was so worth it. I would be very hesitant to leave our child with someone who charged little to nothing; to me, that's a red flag, as it smells of desperation. 

Upon her arrival, she went right to work making mom, dad and baby feel comfortable. We signed some paperwork that she brought, and she asked us if we wanted to check her identification (we did, mostly because we didn't want to look like bad parents by saying no, LOL).

And when I tried calling them, the girl Tanya said the guy would be half an hour late which would then be around 4pm. I waited until 5:30 and called up Tanya again and she acted like she doesn't know what was going.... And said she will call me back after she talks to the guy, but she never called me after that. One thing that I found weird was that at first she said the guy called me but I never answered his call, ACTUALLY I never received a phone call whatsoever. When I called Tanya the second time she said that he ""emailed"" her to let her know he would be half an hour late, like do you not do PHONE CALLS????? 
So would you consider ""leaving customer hanging"" a good business? I don't think so. I am VERY VERY disappointed in this company. Even though it cheaper than other places, I would rather pay a little bit extra to actually have the person SHOW UP and wash my car. What a waste of time AND money, honestly. I DO NOT recommend this place at all... Such a rip off.",2

Their watermelon shake/slushie is great in the summer, and they have these sesame balls encased in this cool gel stuff in ginger broth (or coconut if you're into that. I'm not and they were out of ginger once, and it wasn't the most terrible) that's great in the more chilly seasons. All in all a good time!

The strategic placement of this restaurant definitely adds to the allure. I went during happy hour and got their mussels and sweet potato fries as recommended by my waitress.

Mussels - delicious, buttery goodness
Sweet Potato Fries - Good fries, weird sauce. The selling point was their homemade special sauce for the sweet potato fries which didn't really impress me at all. Too sweet and had little to no taste of anything else.

I found this place on Groupon. I had actually wanted to hit the Coyote game. BUT, I knew my husband (who travels from work and we hadn't had a date night since JULY) would LOVE this!! 
Yay! We're doing this! So, I purchase the Groupon (without reading the fine print... YES. YES. MY FAULT. WELL AWARE)... Here we go. We leave the kids with my parents, it's a date! And, we are going to do something we have never done!! It's going to be worth the 45 minute drive!! 
We pull up, get even more excited, and head in. 
The bitter little sweetheart at the front asked us what we wanted to do, I said, oh we have the Groupon! 
NOPE. So, I continue to discuss with my hubs. What are we going to do? Spend $100 (YES THATS RIGHT) on 2 races for each of us? Plus, the $50 on Groupon for which I don't know if I can get my money back. The girl at the desk says, well, you can come back. I say, we are here on vacation from out of town. She says ""oh"". 
Awesome. Wow. 
Needless to say, we left. And, drove the 45 minutes back. 
Realistically, we could have been accommodated. EASILY! The correct answer would have been ""Let me get my manager"" with an ear to ear smile. 
There is a bright side... Groupon has a fab concept of customer service. Even though I opened the voucher, they refunded my money. Which I was very grateful for! 
So, lessons learned. Always stick with the Coyotes!

The food is decent; I wasn't too impressed with the pizza, but the sandwiches have not disappointed. I have yet to try any of the weekend specials but I've seen some mouthwatering descriptions on the specials menu and on their social media pages.

The creamed spinach and mashed potato (with a trio of aged cheese) were the perfect compliments. My daughter had the New England clam chowder and it arrived filled with clams. She was so stuffed, her calamari was barely touched even though it's lightly breaded and deep fried preparation was too much for me to resist.
You can expect excellent service to go with the meal. I will definitely try their signature steaks next time we are in Vegas.",2
13114,1,1546732800000,"We *love* Greek food and were thrilled to try Poros!  Reserved a lunch table through Open Table app...no issues upon arrival and was seated promptly.  Server was efficient and friendly, no concerns there.  Menu looked very good and I decided on the 3 course Prix Fixe (horiatiki salad, pastisio and baklava ice cream).  

The salad was excellent, though smaller than I'd have liked.  I could overlook that, though, given that it was exactly like the salads I had in Naxos, Greece.  The feta was creamy, the tomatoes, cukes and peppers were at room temp, nice oregano and oil throughout.  One kalamata olive though.  :  (    

Pastisio is my favorite Greek dish...so comforting and warm.  Poros' pastisio is lamb based, and I was surprised to see pieces of lamb instead of the regular ground meat.  From there, it went a bit downhill.  There was one scant later of tube pasta atop the lamb and the sliced tomatoes (also a Poros twist), and that was topped by a further scant later of bechamel (touted as allspice bechamel on the menu).  The bechamel and pasta had solidified into one firm, thin later devoid of any flavor at all.  HUGE disappointment.  Bechamel should be lovely and fragrant and creamy...and far more than a 1/4"" layer.  Being a traditional comfort food, I can't see how you can leave out the pasta, either.  The lamb was cooked excellently - no fat, no gristle, very tender...but, It wasn't seasoned at all.  Much room for improvement in this dish.  With lamb of that quality, it could be a standout.

The star of the show was the baklava ice cream.  Cinnamon based with pieces of honeyed phyllo throughout.  Topped with what I can only describe as a baklava crisp, it was absolutely scrumptious.

Overall, this place has potential.  Gorgeous space, a seemingly eager staff and a menu that shouldn't be too difficult to master, I really hope they fine tune their recipes in the very near future.  I'd head back in a month to give it another shot!",2
13116,3,1547164800000,"So, we came home 2 days ago to find one of those irritating menus left on the doorknob, so we took it inside and left it on the floor.

Yesterday, I was craving some Chinese food when, lo and behold!, what should I stumble upon? The previously discarded Chopstick Express menu. Now, I don't have terribly high expectations of Chinese food outside of New York, but we were pleasantly surprised by both the price and flavor of our meal.

Jamie was coming home for lunch, so I ordered delivery--the shrimp in lobster sauce Lunch combo for me, the mongolian beef Lunch combo for him, then an order of potstickers and a quart of honey-dipped chicken.

Wow. I've been searching EVERYWHERE for boneless honey chicken, and this did not disappoint--it was slathered in this sweet sauce, yet still crispy! 

the Lunch combos come with fried rice, a cream cheese wonton, and a spring roll--all steaming hot and very flavorful. my shrimp in lobster sauce was delicious, but nothing special; it tasted pretty much just like it had at the last place, and the place before that. 

the mongolian beef, on the other hand, was phenomenal! tangy, crispy, maybe a little too salty, but still incredible...it almost tasted  like it had been cooked in teriyaki sauce.

another plus--we were worried that Jamie would have to bring a frozen pizza back to work with him for lunch, since they said the food would arrive at about 12:45(when he leaves for work again)...but they showed up at 12:25! so..yay :)",2
13118,3,1546646400000,"This weekend was the second time that we've boarded our two terriers at the Animal Inn.

The first time was for a little over a week.  Things seemed to go well, though they had a little bit of kennel cough.  From what I understand after some online research, this just kind of happens in boarding pets.

We again used their services for the weekend.  The dogs are always miserable to leave me, and overjoyed to see me, and it's always a nice reunion.  My littlest terrier can be difficult to handle with new people, but they handled her very professionally and gently.  When I picked the dogs up, said ""stranger unfriendly"" dog was walking well-behaved on her leash.

The place itself is reasonably priced, and they allow toys, blankets, etc. to give the dog some familiarity from being away from home.  They also have playtime, where they allow the dogs some time to stretch their legs, and offer to do grooming/washing before you pick them up. They also don't socialize your dogs with other dogs, which is greatly appreciated.

They've also been good sports about times that I've called in to check on my pups (concerned pet parent in me), and the general staff is friendly and helpful overall.

The dogs seem fine after being home.  Happy to be home, content, napping and smelling fresh.  The only thing I have an issue with (though this is through no fault of their own) is that they are a bit of a drive for me to get there.  Again, this is only a personal quibble, and doesn't reflect on them.

I'll board my dogs there again the next vacation.  As long as they're cared for, happy, healthy, and in one piece, I'll be glad to both recommend and use their services.",2

Since I live close by, this is pretty much how CJs and I roll: 1) hit up website, 2) read entire menu 4 to 14 times, 3) pare down top 10 selections to 1 or 2 and call in order, 4) hop in car, and 5) return home 15 minutes later for a private pig out on the coffee table (so I have room to spread out). They do offer delivery, but it takes longer to get my feast on and I don't always need / want $15 of food.

Since it's all pretty much been said, let me just tell you the few things that make CJs a stand out:
* I have never found one thing on their menu that I wouldn't order again. 
* There is nothing that CJs feta doesn't make better... bring it!
* I could eat my weight in their pitas and never tire of them.
* The creamy greek dressing is 'lick your plate clean' to die for.
* You will not find a better deal on baklava anywhere in the city (seriously it would be hard to get the ingredients for the price they charge).

If you are eating in, grab a cold beer or some wine to wash down your meal (and they are working on upgrading their liquor license, so they will have mixed drinks soon).

Don't let the location or the homey diner atmosphere fool you. This place serves up incredible food made from insanely fresh ingredients with flavors to match!",2

Even after we do so, it is only mixed halfway through the cup of ice cream. It is disappointing because nobody buys a blizzard only expecting half of it to be mixed properly and the bottom half to contain only vanilla ice cream.

13200,3,1548374400000,"Yasu continues to deliver all these years... my very favorite place for sushi and sumibiyaki.  What you should not pass up at Yasu:
Red Roll
Premium Spicy Tuna Roll
the Lamb
Bacon wrapped Scallops

I am not big into lamb, but this lamb is amazing!  It is prepared over a charcoal fire called sumibiyaki.  You can also smell it burning in the parking lot and the smell alone is enough to drive you nuts.  I did not know what sumibiyaki was prior to visiting Yasu.  It is grilled food prepared over high end Japanese charcoal called binchotan. (Who knew?!)  There is a whole menu prepared this way and I think everyone needs to try it.  

The Premium Spicy Tuna Roll is like no other I have ever had before.  I dream of the heat and texture that just melts in your mouth, making you wish there were more than 5 pieces.  The glory of sushi is you can always just order more and nobody thinks you are a piggy... it's expected. 

Yasu is a nice quaint restaurant perfect for a date or gathering with good friends, seating is intimate and the staff is attentive and friendly.  I think I need to make eating here a weekly event.",2
13201,3,1548806400000,"Let's get one thing out of the way. This isn't a gourmet pizza place and my rating is based on your run of the mill pizza places. With that being said you can't beat their 6$ and 5$ pizza deals for that price. 
The Extra Most Bestest is 6 bucks and I am surprised at the amount of pepperoni they put on a 6 dollar pizza to be honest. They pretty much load it up with pepperoni for that price. The cheese amount is pretty decent as well. They also have a stuffed crust version if you want to spend 3$ more at 9$, but to be honest it's not really worth the extra 3$. 
For the price and quality at that price; you really can't beat this deal and the location is always busy so you know that the pizza is was made fairly fresh with how many people are coming in. We get the pizza here often. Great budget pizza (and that is why I gave it 4 stars).",2

There are a few places we love downtown and upon reading about Esther's and what they hope to be we were so wanting to be blown away... with that said....  we ordered a fair amount of menu items 

Hamachi crudo (possibly the best thing we are sorry no picture),  burrata, Meatballs, cavatelli pasta, carbonara, lobster lagsanette, porchetta 

Meatballs not exciting but when are with burrata improved. Liked the Cavatelli and Carbonara.  The lobster pasta we did not like.  Porchetta needed more sauce, was uncuttable with knife provided, had to tear with hands.  Needed more flavor and tenderness.  Very busy place server was nice but they were not organized with a good system to tend to customers properly.  We wanted a steak knife to cut the pork but couldn't get one so we ended up just boxing up for the dog.

I got some artificial grass, palms and other plants put in and they fixed the irrigation at a reasonable rate.  They do a great job, highly recommend them.  English speaking was a big bonus.",1

If you are comparing the bao to Bahm mi boys, you will be sorely disappointed because it is really not in the same league. However, it is a decent place to get an asian fusion sandwich.

We had the chicken fried bao, fish bao, bulgogi taco, and bulgogi kimchi fries. The chicken was the best and my kid liked his taco. However, the bao isn't fluffy, it is dense. And, the cold slaw isn't korean cold slaw, just shredded vegetables.

For dogs: a large fenced area, a large pond area for the doggies, and also a smaller fenced area for timid dogs. 

If you're in the area it's a nice place bring your pooch. My only gripe is the people who come here. There are various types of owners from bad attitude with bad dogs to good owners and good dogs to owners who have a dog and don't know how to act at a dog park. Usually when it's crowded ""owners"" are on good behavior.

Bottom line: it's a great park, but some days you'll get owners who will ruin the trip for you and your dog. Would give it 3.5 if I could.",2

The carpet had two huge stains. The bathroom tv was not working. The worst part was the bed. The mattress was so sunken in on one side of the bed it was like sleeping on a ski slope. Terrible nights sleep. 
  My dining experience was very average. Both for dinner and breakfast they were very understaffed and the service was spotty. timing for the food was extremely slow and the dishes all came out barely warm. 
  The part that really upset me is when I complained to the front desk upon check out about my experience. The agent brushed it aside and basically cut me off.

You can review all their cocktails, beers and wines on the ipad they give when you go in which gives you info on ingredients, origin, proof, etc. I could have easily spent two hours in this place just looking through all the different cocktails they make.

All of that, Egg Works.

I've been to Hash House (pretty much live there when I stay downtown) a lot, and while I do love that place, this local little breakfast nook has supplanted HH.

So, as I said, I hop on a bar stool, the manager Gia stops over to throw down on some coffee and ask if I have any questions. Nope. Menu is straight forward, well laid out and my prey is ripe for the picking: The Sundance Special Omelet. What's that you ask? Spinach, sliced mushrooms, artichoke hearts folded with Swiss cheese and a special Works artichoke cheese filling and then topped with feta cheese and fresh tomatoes. Right from the menu. But, am I satisfied with all that? Nope, throw in the chicken!!! Opted for the American fries and some sourdough as well.

The omelet... amazing. Perfectly done, ingredients all complimented each other and the chicken was seasoned perfectly with a bit of a spicy, southwest style seasoning. The kicker though, the special sauce, having some sort of lime flavor to it, which literally had me doing back flips off the stool. I swear I went into the hunch over the plate to ensure my neighbors didn't even look at it. Sourdough toast was toasted perfectly, not cold and was a perfect vessel to help wreck the omelet. 

American fries (while I normally opt for hashbrowns, figure, it's a house special, go with it) were incredible. Each spud was crisp on the outside, fluffy inside and hit up with that same southwest kind of seasoning the chicken had.

13368,1,1547683200000,"My wife and I decided to head out to the Galleria Mall today and visit Best Buy and Costco.  We were there early and the stores were not open yet.  So, we decided to grab a brunch.  As we drove around looking for a place to eat, we noticed a small restaurant located on a strip outside of the Sunset Casino ~ the Alohoa Kitchen.  We figure it was a mom/pop kinda restaurant and thought it would be good to try and dine here.

Here is the good.  As you walk in, it is pretty clean and spacious.  It has a ""Tiki"" type built to it.  Pretty cool.  Also, from the menu offering, everything was reasonably priced ~ about $8-10 per plate.

Now, the bad... no customers were in the restaurant (bad sign).  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken with rice.  And, my wife ordered the Ribs with rice.  It was served on a styro-foam plate with soft utensils.

Oh my, okay... breathe... while eating the rice, it was like grinding pebbles.  I had to turn to my wife and tell her that we are in Bedrock.  Call me Fred Flintstones and her Wilma.  We needed Bam Bam to hammer the rice and make it edible.  

Note to the cook:  How to cook rice... Pour rice into rice cooking pot, ADD WATER (I think this step was seriously missed), make sure you measure at least a 1/3 index finger size of water at the top, press cook, and wait for 30 minutes for beep.  Damn!  How hard is it to cook rice man!  I know we live in Las Vegas, it is in a desert, and we need to conserve water; but dog, just sacrifice and add a cup of water to your rice.  

As for the Teriyaki chicken, I think they served me ""yesterday's"" chicken.  It tasted like ""over-nuked"" chicken.  Extremely rubbery and very tasteless.  In order to hide this deficiency, the cook LATHERED the chicken in Teriyaki sauce.  The end result:  It looked and tasted like eating Molasses with uncooked rice.  yuck, yuck and ga-zillion yuck.

I ate 3 spoonful too many.

As for my wife's Ribs, it was tough as hell.  Again, it was obviously nuked.

Of note, there are people in the world who think they can cook, who are good cooks, who can open a restaurant, and survive...

And, then, there are owners like the Aloha Kitchen, who think they can cook, who have no clue how bad their food is, who still ends up opening a restaurant, and who probably would not survive.

Finally, I would not recommend this place.  We definitely will NOT return.  For two of us, with drinks, and tip, it amounted to $24.  Honestly, a better deal would be to go to Chili's -- have a decent appetizer and 2 entrees for $20.... 

I wished we can rate this a ZERO or negative star...",2

Starting with drinks I ordered a cappuccino and a virgin Bloody Mary (give me ALL the drinks). I was pleased they could do the virgin for me because I was absolutely craving a bloody but had a long drive ahead of me after we ate. It was delicious, very spicy, a little salty, and had a strong olive taste. Cappuccino looked pretty, tasted decent enough. Nothing spectacular with that. 

For food I ordered pastrami hash - oh. my. god. The meat was sooo good. Parts of it were nice and crunchy like it was a good piece of bacon, other parts were fatty and stringy like a good hunk of corned beef. Instead of typical toast (white, rye), they grill a hunk of sourdough bread. Perfect to sop up your egg with. The hash was small diced potatoes, red onion, and red bell pepper. I loved his dish. 

Husband got the classic ""steak and eggs"" dish that also came with hash. He loved the hash, but did not like the quality of the steak, and did not appreciate the sourdough instead of regular toast. I guess this is a preference thing. 

Our server was really nice and did a good job. The price is a little steep because this is definitely a trendy spot, not like a small 24/7 breakfast diner. You pay for the ambiance of 4th street and whatnot. Would definitely recommend for a breakfast spot that is innovative and trendy.",2

It's probably just something that comes with age, but when it's the weekend and I'm hangry-hungover, I want NO PART of a uppity brunch social scene. I don't want to squeeze into a corner and wait hours to be seated. I don't want to spend ""dinner date/night out""kinds of money on breakfast. I don't want some eclectic take on traditional dishes. And I don't want to be around brunch people--you know who you are.

You know what I do want? A good eggs Benedict made with REAL BUTTER. I want to be seated within 10 mins, tops. I want elbow room, calmness, timeliness and a cocktail wouldn't hurt. I want a check under $50 for breakfast--you can have your deconstructed breakfast sandwich with artisan whatever. I want a greasy, delicious breakfast on my time. 

Enter, My Friends. 

It's a 24/7 diner with stick-to-your-ribs food. It has booths, carpeting and no-frills service. I have no idea what the health score is, nor do I care. They serve a damn good eggs Benedict made with REAL BUTTER (unlike a nearby, popular diner) everyday and their bacon is perfectly crunchy. The coffee tasted a little bitter, but overall a decent cup of diner joe. They also boast WiFi AND a wine/beer menu. That means they have mimosas! 

We stopped in during the Saturday brunch rush and were seated right away, served delicious food within 10 minutes and checked out well under $50. This is my new favorite place for breakfast.",2

I looked online prior to going to get a good idea of what I would want (I'm very picky about my sushi being that I am from California and know quality fish) and decided I would keep it simple and order off the happy hour menu. Prior to ordering, I had the waitresses (we had two for some reason, could possibly have been a training situation, but it was never relayed to us) explain the options and ordered from their explanations. Everything I ordered was ok - they did have some great vegetable tempura, everything was fresh. When we got our bills, they separated them (which was nice) but I noticed that we were charged regular price for everything that was marked ""Happy Hour"". I tried to nicely ask a girl at the front, and she played it off and said that prices have changed and I simply replied that they should market these changes better consider people are coming for the happy hour deals. I didn't feel like holding myself up any further since we were leaving to watch the game, but I definitely will not be returning. I feel like I was cheated out of my money and the customer service was less than par. The one star is for the tempura lol - even if it was still inexpensive - this day and age, it is not that difficult to update menus and staff of current deals or to accommodate a customer if they catch you in a mess up.",3

I can't say I have left here disappointed.  If you're looking for a well-appointed, modern, perfectly-decorated-to-the-nines type of place, this ain't it.  If you are looking for a place to get some good body work done, well, this is the place.

I have had a couple of Swedish massages here, and they were great.  In fact, I'd say they were one of the better places in town for this.  

Now, let me tell you about the energy massage.  I booked one not really knowing what it was, and it definitely was not anything like I was expecting.  You have to have an open mind, because if you don't it will feel little more like someone waving their hands in front of your face to soothe your pains.  I have to admit that I felt very relaxed after the massage, if not just as much as a standard hands-on massage, but it didn't cure all that ailed me.  

One of the things I love about this place is that I can book online, and usually get same-day appointments.  Also, they have frequent Groupons and deals so you can get a good discount on a massage.

So, I guess I could say this is a great place for getting a massage, and if you have an open mind, it could be even better.",2

Arrived around 11P.M. on a Thursday night and was helped after standing in line for less than 5 minutes. The lady at the front desk was extremely nice and helpful. I asked for a room with a view, and man oh man, she gave us a room with a breathtaking view of the strip. THANKS LADY :D

House cleaning was on point. Every time we came back to the room after a day of exploring, the place was cleaned and nicely put together. They even organized all our belongings on the table AND in the bathroom-- Brownie point because of my OCD :)

Pros: Very nice swimming pool area with a full bar.
Connected to the mall -- easy access to food/shops.

Cons: It gets a little congested near the elevators because you need to swipe cards before you can go on the elevator. I guess to keep Elara is safe from intruders...?

My burger was extremely wet which caused the entire thing to fall apart making it impossible to eat.  I also don't understand why they tell you that you can have anything that you want on your burger, but give such skimpy amounts.  ONE mushroom on a burger does not count as a topping.  

I agree that the fry order is strange.  It's fine for two people to share, but I can't imagine going solo for lunch and ordering such a massive amount of fries.  

I don't get the whole peanuts-in-a-burger-joint thing.......peanuts and burgers?

Prices are a bit on the higher side for such typical burgers.  Can't get out of there for under $10 person.  If the burgers were fantastic, I wouldn't mind the pricing, but they aren't that great.

13650,1,1547078400000,"The cursed space on 7th Street.  Over the years this has been more restaurants/bars than I can ever humanly remember (Eden, Ed's, blah blah and blah).  One reason is probably the crappy parking arrangement (or more correctly, the total lack of parking).  If you are lucky you can park in the lot behind the house, which have a few ""premium spaces.""  Otherwise you will just have to make do across the street next to Starbucks/Dollar General (though I never know if they will actually enforce towing).   Forget parking at Showmars, since they now have built a giant wood panel fence so you can't walk through... booo

Somehow I always end up being here on a Friday night, which is normally a low key night for me.  This place has the prettiest patio thanks to the perfectly hung lights above the entire decking area (and as observed, with zero burnt out bulb).  I can probably do without the giant shamrock but hey, it's irishly romantic.  They have 3, 4 flat screen tvs for game watching outside.  On a perfect weather night (like last night), it was simply amazing to catch up with friends while downing a cheap cold beer ($2 PBR bottle... keep the cap so you can play a hand of poker... I am not lying... next time look at a PBR bottle cap).  

We actually ate there last night.  Food wasn't impressive.  Tomato Bisque was actually way better than anything else.  I have the beef sandwich (aka french dip) and it was ok.  The skewer appetizer was not that appetizing.  I do have to say our waitress was good.  She kept the drinks coming and never was away for too long and she actually appeared to not mind working there lol  

I hope Kennedy's makes it... it's nice to just bounce around in my own neighborhood without the uptown madness.",2

Lori is the sales manager, and she was extremely helpful. After we placed the order online back in September, she called and emailed to introduce herself and to make sure I had her contact incase we needed it closer to the trip. Then, she reviewed all of the dishes to make sure that they would be okay for the 3 swimmers on our team who have severe nut allergies.

The order was delivered on time, with the plates and serving-ware that we requested. Everything ran smoothly, the food was great, and the service was better than most of my catering experiences. 

I have used this business in Chandler in years past and the service was nowhere near as good as it was this year. I believe that Lori is new and she made all the difference in making sure that we had a great experience.",1
13663,2,1546819200000,"I really wanted to like this place. but it disappointed. We expect good value and reliably good food at Greek places around Chicagoland, but I guess Cleveland isn't so picky. It is very hard to find, and parking is expensive, The wait was long and the food disappointing. I ordered the smelt special, thinking smelt should be cheap and plentiful and should be well prepared at a Greek place but it was expensive, and only had about 6 small. greasy, overbrowned but ironically, uncrispy little guppies. It wasn't even enough as an appetizer, and I can't think how they could have screwed up the preparation without trying, I have prepared them at least 20 times and they are the easiest thing to prepare perfectly every time. The rest of the food (wraps) was okay but definitely underwhelming. The kicker for me was that using a credit card was performed on an IPOD that automatically defaulted to a 15 or 20% tip, which is ridiculous at a counter service dive with no service, and attempting to change the default was difficult.  The concept of paying a tip BEFORE you find out how bad the food tastes and for no real service is ludicrous.",2
13671,3,1547596800000,"I like Princess Auto, they sell a huge assortment of ""stuff"" here. If you've never set foot in here before, its kind of like going on a treasure hunt. The first time I went here was about a year ago when I was looking for a heater to watch my son's football practices. They had at least a half dozen options, and I ended up purchasing a Big Buddy portable heater. They sell all sorts of tools, air compressors, snow blowers, trailer accessories, just to name a few. They also sell some, what I call (junkie) items. They sell some electronics accessories, like HDMI cables, light dimmers and even a few toys. These aren't of the highest quality, so if you need something better then look elsewhere.
The store itself is large, open, and bright. Whenever I'm stuck as to where I might be able to find something, I usually end up at Princess Auto. It seems they sell almost everything under the sun.

13677,1,1547856000000,"Aquarela Restaurant just looks so dark from the outside, and trust me it is much darker in the inside.

Having a drink here with the loud Latin beat music from a Live DJ does make me feel I am back on an Caribbean Island somewhere.. Unfortunately the beers here are limited to ""Canadian Domestic"" and Corona or Heineken. And I could not find my Caribe for 99 cents each!

Aquarela aside from being a neighbourhood watering hole, it also serves authentic Dominican & Latin American Cuisine. We shared:

Tostones ($3.50)
- soft and moist and addictive

Chivo a la Monte Cristi ($11.50)
- Stewed Goat in an Oregano Sauce made to a taste of Monte Cristi Served with Rice
- Goat is soft and tender and the seasoning is really subtle without being overpowering
- A popular dish in Northern part of Dominican

Mofongo ($11.50)
- Deep Fried Plantains Mashed with a House Garlic Sauce and Chicharron de Puerco Served with A Choice of Meat
- Served in a pilon (wooden Mortar) is really nicely presented
- The shrimp is on the smallish side but I do love the mushiness of the plantains and the sausage gives it an extra bite and the smokey taste

Watching reruns of the Blue Jays 1993 final games when they won the World Series while dining was just a really strange experience for me... But it can be worse, watching reruns of the Leafs 1967 when they won their last Stanley Cup!

Here at Aquarela, one can find a taste of the Caribbean. Warm hospitality, loud music, good food. If you prefer a more family environment, they do opens during lunch..",3

Dirty O will always take the cake in that category. Glad they cleaned up the bathrooms a bit because that was a dungeon you didn't want to enter.

13694,2,1548115200000,"Once again, I regret I can't give less than one star. This is a HORRIBLE place! They sell animals and offer cats for adoption, and the conditions they are in are bad to deplorable. I saw empty, DRY water bowls in many of the cages, and the lack of regular cleaning was obvious. I had gone by to pick up a few things about a week and a half ago and saw, and smelled, that the litter box in the adoption cage was in dire need of cleaning. A few days later, it had not been cleaned, and today, it STILL had not been cleaned! When I pointed it out to the cashier, in the hopes that she could get someone to do something about it, she snapped, ""That's not my job!"" My husband and I also had trouble finding the foods we know they stock, and this is often because they are still in the back, and not on the shelves, a day or two after they have been delivered. We were able to get someone to go get items for us, but they were not terribly polite about it, even though we were buying CASES at their highly inflated prices. Thanks to them, though, I discovered that Amazon has the case lots for 2/3rds LESS than Pet Supplies Plus, has free shipping, and will deliver them to our door. That's the only good thing I can say about this dirty, randomly stocked, overpriced store. Today was the last time we will shop there. I recommend you pass them by, drive a mile or two farther along Detroit and try PetPeople in Rocky River. They DON'T sell animals there, the store is well stocked and CLEAN, the staff is knowledgeable and helpful, and they truly seem to care about people's pets. Also, the prices are LOWER there.",2

On a positive note, the facility is small and non threatening (good for those like me who are not really gym people overall).  All the machines are well kept and you can easily get access to one right away.  They offer a ton of free weights and a schedule of classes.  I'm a HUGE fan of the yoga workshop by Sherry.  She really describes the postures and why they are good for your body.  It's a wonderful class to take for beginners to yoga to really understand the full benefits of the practice.  I can't speak for the other classes but they seem like fun and have people religiously attending them.

13705,3,1547337600000,"First time at Johnny's...don't think any of our party will ever return. Other than what looked like a very nice, historic building and nice decor, can't come up with too many positives. I really don't understand so many positive comments about the staff, the service and the extra special attention they are known for. 

Went for Downtown Cleveland Restaurant Patio Week, and specified that when calling for reservations. Ignored at the door by 2 servers who were standing there hearing our conversation about whether we needed to go inside to find a host stand or if someone greeted you outside for patio dining. Went inside, reservation confirmed, led completely through the restaurant to a very nice table near the front windows, seated, then learned that the Patio Week menu was only served outside. Made the reverse trip through the restaurant to our table outside. 

3-course prix fixe menu sounded great. Among our group we had all 3 appetizers offered, 2 of the 3 entrees and all 3 desserts. 

Asked how the heirloom tomato salad would be prepared....or server did not know, said the kitchen prepares it differently each time. May be sliced, may be wedges, but would be served with bocconcini mozzarella, olive oil, balsamic reduction, herbs, etc. Turned out to be caprese style with 2 slices of flavorless, medium sized grocery store tomatoes and 2 slices of a fresh mozzarella log. Said to the server ""these certainly don't LOOK like heirloom tomatoes""....he said, ""they don't to me either"" and walked away. (Wife's mixed greens was, again, straight out of the grocery store bag; not much flavor in the soup of the day either. 

Bacon Wrapped Filet looked and smelled great. Ordered medium rare....presented medium well (I chose to keep it rather than hold up the rest of the table). Said to the server "" does this look medium rare to you? He""....he said ""no, that looks really overdone"". The au gratin potatoes were so salty that I could not eat them, and I really do like well salted starch dishes. (Server had told us that Johnnys is ""know for"" its veal and the bananas foster....the veal picatta portions were very generous, but was pretty heavily breaded and rather dry.) 

We had all 3 of the deserts offered. The flourless chocolate torte really was good. A friend had the apple cake which he said was very good as well. The bananas foster... the desert that Johnnys is known for... near the worst that we have ever had. Severely undercooked... the sauce was thin, runny and underdeveloped and the bananas were almost raw. 

We were never offered the customer survey and sweepstakes entry form that should be part of Patio Week. We were never offered any apology or any accommodation for the several obvious problems with our meal. The owner spent most of the evening pacing the sidewalk and smoking just across the rail from the ""nonsmoking end of the patio"". 

Quite a disappointment to us, having recently located to the area and anxious to find the wonder downtown food scene that Cleveland is supposed to be know for. Johnnys was NOT the place for us to start!",1
13706,3,1547683200000,"I liked the food, however the manager or owner always parks their van beside the building and makes a hard parking lot to get through even tougher.  If they cut corners parking where else are they cutting corners?",2

I sat outside on consecutive warm summer evenings and watched the happy kitchen crew create beautiful, fresh, eclectic food bursting with flavor.  They did this while having fun (except for the girl with the tattoo on her neck who only very rarely smiled unfortunately).  Most importantly, the kitchen crew loves to blast old school rap which for thirty something's like me is, well, intoxicating. 

I even bought a t-shirt, enough said.

13743,3,1546732800000,"Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.  

We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.  

My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named ""Best Mole"" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!  

Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!   

Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old.",2

A different bartender came up and took my order. He had a much better attitude than the first bitch wearing cheap makeup and hoop earrings. I began to feel better. I placed my order, and waited.

I was in need of some coffee and was in the area so I stopped into Urban Beans on a Thursday mid-morning. First of all, they have a very cozy patio with canopy style roofing and large bulb stranded lights (they weren't on because it was 11am). 

The interior is larger than you'd expect. Counter with 2 bakery cases (chuck full of pies, muffins, cupcakes, brownies, etc.) side bar area, two seating areas (one medium with window seating, one large with couches more appropriate for longer period of sitting). 

I ordered the caramel toffee nut mocha and a gluten-free red velvet cupcake, came out to be $8. Not bad. My coffee was a large and lemme tell you, it's very large. I'm gittery just typing this but in the best way possible. The cupcake was delightful, huge thick topping of sprinkled icing and a yummy, moist cake bottom.

The staff is very friendly. In fact, I was complimented twice in a matter of the 20 minutes I was there on my outfit so you know the staff has to be friendly if they're attracting such pleasant merchants too.

I will def go back here.",1

13832,2,1546646400000,"I had the unfortunate opportunity of visiting Hakka Bro's couple days ago with a group of guys. To start off...we had made a reservation for 7:30 and when half of the group arrived, the waiter/owner/chef said that if the rest of the group did not show up by 7:30 we would lose our reservation (the whole restaurant was empty FYI). The service was 1/10 since the waitress did not even know what was on the menu herself and had a hard time understanding our orders that she had to call the waiter/owner/chef to write up a completely new order, wasting 20 mins of our time already. Usually hakka joints serve their food pretty fast but this place served their food faster than they took the order and that was pretty odd and questionable. The food tasted 5/10... nothing special. But thanks to Hakka Bro's, majority of the group suffered from horrible food poisoning the day after. IF YOU ARE READING THIS...SPARE YOURSELVES, unless you are looking to clear your system.. in that case go right ahead.

WILL NOT BE RETURNING",2
13838,1,1547164800000,"Aesthetically speaking, the hotel is pretty cool.  A bit of swank in the lobby with the new furniture; the casino is all right, but certainly not the fanciest in the world.  The rooms are, for the most part, well-appointed and comfortable.  We had a 24th floor view room in the south tower and it suited us just fine.

That's about where my praise ends.  I mean, unless you want to talk about the restaurants, but that's not what we're here to discuss.

First things first - the check-in line.  It was long, but it was around 2-3pm so I had kind of expected it.  They had about four people working the desk, so that was acceptable.  What threw me off was the attitude of the woman checking me in.  It wasn't rude, but it wasn't very friendly, if you catch my drift.  It was like, ""I'm here.  I showed up for work today.  That's about all you get.""  There was no, ""Welcome to the Plaza"" or other simple pleasantries.  I didn't expect over the top exuberance and enthusiasm, but I didn't expect Eeyore to be checking me in either.

My room was booked as a 1 King Bed View Room.  As she checked us in, she asked me, ""Two beds is fine, right?""  Um.  No.  I know that bedding isn't guaranteed at many places and sometimes, depending on when you check in, there just aren't king rooms available anymore.  That didn't seem to be the case, though - she just was going to place us arbitrarily into a room with two queens.  I told her that I'd prefer a room with one king, expecting her to tell me if there was one available...instead, I was met with no response.  I ended up getting a king room, so it's not like they were unavailable.  I don't understand why she wanted to just put us in the two bed room.

My room was pre-paid through an online travel agency, but I knew that there was a $10 daily resort fee.  Complain if you will, but this is pretty much a Vegas standard...and $10 a day is WAY cheaper than what you'd pay at a Strip hotel.  However, not ONCE did the girl mention the charge.  Not ONCE did she mention the $50 deposit...not until she announced, ""Okay, that'll be a total of $83.""  I must've looked at her funny because that's when she mentioned that $50 of it was a deposit that would be refunded when I checked out.  Again, though, not ONCE was I ever informed of the resort fee, so it's a good thing I already knew about it.

And then?  My card was authorized for $96.  It reconciled two days later to the appropriate amount, but why the increase?  I've only seen that happen at restaurants where a tip may be included.  *shrugs*

When my room keycard quit working, I received the same kind of lackluster, ""I came in to work today, what more do you want?"" attitude towards service.  I wasn't listened to - for example I mentioned that my husband's card WAS working, but she insisted that must be the battery on the doorlock that was running low.  

When my players' club card did the same thing, it was the same thing.  Also, the player's club had a new member promotion - on the second day of play, you'd be credited with 50% of your losses from the first day.  Same thing on the third day.  So, when I went on the second day to the player's club desk to get my card fixed, I asked if I had any credit on my card - since the way it was explained to me, the amount would just be added to my card.  Not so much.  The woman pulled up my account, sighed heavily and then said, ""Well, I can give you five dollars.""  She made it feel like a handout, when I was just wanting to know if I had earned anything.  

Also was not impressed with some of the things in the room.  First of all, where were the ashtrays?  This was supposed to be a smoking room, but no ashtrays - maybe they were all used up in the non-smoking rooms?  We used one of the plastic cups filled with water and left it out so housekeeping would see and maybe get the hint.  They never did.  No hotel directory, no TV guide, no fridge (but clearly a space where one used to be or should have been), only two towels and no additional pillow or bedding.  We called housekeeping to come pick up some soiled linens and set them outside the door...no one came for at least six hours.  The hair dryer was clearly a wall mounted model like you usually see in hotel rooms...except that it wasn't wall mounted, so it was clunky and ridiculous to use with the wall mount dangling off it while you tried to dry your hair.

We used Express Checkout 24 hours ago and I still have not received a copy of my bill, despite providing them my email address and telephone number.

My husband used the exercise room and was pleased.  We ate a couple times at the McDonald's on the ground floor and that was all right, good to have 24 hours.  

Otherwise, though?  Meh.  If the service were even infinitesimally better, maybe it'd be all right.  It's not, though, and we'll be taking our business to the Golden Nugget or the Four Queens instead.",2

In addition, you offered to assist me in removing and hauling away a rusty, unstable metal fence that we'd inherited - again, for a very fair price, and during the same visit!

13844,1,1547510400000,"I haven't been disappointed yet at this Mimi's. I have not had to wait longer than 5 minutes to be seated, and the hostess is always very friendly. The menu is very diverse, but it is a bit annoying that some items do not have their price listed (i.e. coffee drinks). It's a small thing to be irritated about, but I was kind of surprised that a cup of regular coffee was $3.29. The service has been great! My family and I have not felt rushed, and our waiter or waitress is quick to take our order and bring refills. I like that the manager walks around to check on each table. The food itself is pretty decent. They have these buy one get one deals that make the price worth it; otherwise, I think it's a bit expensive for a family. I usually get the skewers - you get two seafood skewers (salmon, scallops, or shrimp), ratatouille, salad, and some flatbread. Their birthday crepe cake is also very good! Sometimes they have deals on their receipts if you complete a survey (we got a free birthday cake after completing the survey on our latest receipt). Before your food is brought out, they offer you a complimentary bread basket. I love the madeleines! For a quick breakfast item, the almond croissants are delicious! They have an almond paste in them that is just the right amount of sweetness.",3

And the french fries they put in.. could probably eat a whole basket of these they are seasoned to perfection. The tzaziki sauce is so good as well. Price for the gyros is reasonable around $8. 

Will be back for more gyros.",2
13857,2,1548374400000,"I have been to this location in the past and thought it was decent enough for a quick lunch. Nothing special but good.

This time around was completely different. We were in for a later dinner. About 8pm or so. We were told the wait would be about 5-10 min. This turned out to be more like 20 mins. We were then seated at the back if the restaurant near the entrance to the dish pit. Two people in our party got a glimpse of it and said there were dishes and food all over the floor. Both of them work in the food industry and were pretty aghast at the state of it.

We had a variety of dishes. The soup salad and breadsticks were all good. My meal was so blah that I don't even remember what I ordered. I stole a couple bites of my husbands ziti and it was good.  

Now we were in later in the evening so I understand that some closing things may happen while we eat but I was so distracted by all the stuff going on. One server walked by our table untucking his shirt as he went into the back. Ice was being emptied out of the bar into buckets and it was so loud I had to ask my husband to repeat himself. Servers were standing around in the middle of the floor chatting about their after work plans. It took a very long time for our main meals to come out after our soup/salad. 

Also when we were leaving three employees who all appeared to be ""working"" were at the door and not a single one thanked us or even said goodbye as we left the restaurant.

I know it is a chain restaurant and I do not expect a fine dining experience but based on our time there I will not be returning to the Olive Garden in Calgary again.",2

13863,3,1548460800000,"There were three of us that met here to see The Hitman's Body Guard for the 7 PM show tonight. All of us had never been to this theatre so we were thrilled that our experience turned out so well. It was a breeze to get a ticket, order our food and get our seats. When you order your food, you pick it up at the cafe which is really the ice cream bar. We got the usual fare of hot dogs, cokes and popcorn. Three orders of food came out hot and we were surprised the hot dogs were not soggy and that the condiment bar was stocked with ketchup, mustard and relish.

As far as the theatre itself and the seats, the theatre was clean, bathroom was not only visually pleasing but very clean (everything is white in the ladie's room so it was very peaceful looking) and all three seats we got in a row in the upper part of the theatre were working just fine. I particularly love these seats as they were wide and there were many ways you can recline and almost lay flat down. Who doesn't want to be able to fully extend and put your feet up.

What was unusual about this theatre was the perfect room temperature. Almost always, I have to dress in a sweatshirt and bring a cashmere throw because of how cold the theatre is but in this case, the temp while watching the movie stayed the same.

This is only my second theatre in AZ that I've visited and will be returning as it was a great experience.",3

Not even sure who our server was because only saw someone when they took our order and a different person brought the food. Many hours later, the food is still haunting me.",2
13875,3,1548201600000,"OMG This place is more of knick knacks and pulses and Indo afghani spices, pulses and etc. Also on right corner they have little corner ( Not very little ) cafe where you are served food. I ordered Falafel $ 2.99. It came with 3 Falafels with Lettuce and Tomatoes and some sort of curd mix to Grip Lettuce and tomatoes and 2 Pita's . FAlafel is made of fava and garbanzo grounded with spices and deep fried balls.Totally Worth it. It's not spicy at all. So you can add Hot Sauce , Black pepper- available as condiments. Trust me Its more Like Gyrco .The only difference is it comes as wrap when you order and has meat in it. However falafel comes Pita that you can wrap in lettuce, tomatoes and 1 and half falafel for I Pita and Hot sauce and pich of Black Pepper. On the other end Gyro is $ 3.99 I guess. So $2.99 Is inexpensive and when you are veggie eater. Go for Falafel. I had 2 comrades, 1 ordered Gyro, 2nd  ordered Fava Beans and Basmati Rice. it is high quality (Long Grained Rice_ It looks like it is Zafrani for sure. It was in large portions.. It was something $ 3.49 or $3.99. 

Almost all things they serve have large portions..and quiet reasonable You feel full when you eat there.Good Mediterranean Food with Large Portions.

Also they have fresh Feta Chese at $ 4.40 approx per pound. Not bad at all. I am to try try that when i head there again. I will post pictures when i go again. I had no battery to take pictures.

13877,3,1548720000000,"Humble definitely follows the trend happening in Lakewood away from the dive bar scene and more into gastropub type places. This area of Lakewood specifically is following that trend, I'm sure thanks to Melt. Lakewood owes Matt Fish a big high five. 

We went for happy hour, which ends at 6p and is only at the bar. I disapprove. It was a beautiful day outside, but everything we wanted was on the happy hour menu and a great deal, so we skipped the big patio and headed inside. 

Things were great from there. The wine was delicious and for once I can say I might have liked a Merlot more than a cab. I was starving, but it was too early for real dinner, so we just had a pizza at the bartenders recommendation. It was mushroom and it was awesome (and big!). The bartender was also great, super chatty and knowledgeable. I hate when bartenders don't know what they are talking about (*cough*greenhousetavern*cough) the  non happy-hour prices are definitely on the high end, so you expect a higher level of service and we got it!

The sauce had a solid natural tomato flavor and a nice mild zip.  Really terrific.  Just can't wait to go back and maybe even order a full pie this time.  

Have also found the employees to be not only friendly but helpful as well.  The typical wait time is average and food comes out in an acceptable amount of time.

First time I went here, I was amazed at how tasty the Tempura Fish Taco was.  I like how it is topped with feta cheese.  I smother my tacos with their butt burning hot sauce.  I dare try not to test the habanero sauce.

The issue is not the food.  Service, presentation, and time to get my food is what makes this 3 stars.  Their cashiers are always slow.  And the time it takes to make 2 tacos seems like eternity.  To top it off, the portions of meat in the tacos have shrank and it seems they just through everything all over the place.

This is the former, venerable PressBox on Montford.  PressBox went through a couple ownership changes in short order, and remodeled from the old, dark pub place to a more open front and large back patio place.

The new ownership has advanced the evolution, and (thankfully) redone the restrooms.  Signficant upgrades within and out on the rear deck.

Menu has a couple ""nods"" to the old Pressbox menu (remember the CamelRider?), but nothing in the new lineup thrilled me. Were I better dressed I would have walked next door to Good Food on Montford.

What can I say about IC besides if you're coming here you're pretty much here for their alcohol cause the food, at least what I had, wasn't that great. The interior is very nice, I like, and the staff was friendly but slow and they have a pretty good selection of alcohol. I had a beer but don't remember what I had, I'm sure it was something that I randomly picked of the menu.

First up was the Rice Cracker Skewer Combo http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-cocokala-las-vegas?select=qIylUSrrG5sdLAJXrFyKCA#qIylUSrrG5sdLAJXrFyKCA I was very disappointed in the dish it was literally a few small skewed items fried in rice crackers with some ginger sauce. Maybe a few more larger skewers and not too fried I'd be nice. Even so it was too pricey and didn't taste so good.

Next was the Braised Black Pork Belly http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-cocokala-las-vegas?select=qIylUSrrG5sdLAJXrFyKCA#RFBIBkFfkoWItCH9vJYuMg which cost about $7. I didn't care for it.  Though it was cheaper and a little more filling than the Rice Cracker Skewers it almost tasted like eating an oily shoyu chicken but with pork belly. I needed some rice with it.

***If u booked the tour by credit card make sure u bring cash I guess they charge when u get there and because your out there the wireless payment by phone may not be working. It was 289.00 for both my husband and I. They'll honor the groupon and just need to pay the difference. 
KC was our guide and his motto was to have fun and be safe in which we did. 
**FYI First timer I didn't know what to wear so I have a shirt and capri on since it was hot in the desert but I should have listen to and earlier post I have sensitive skin so the exhaust heat was burning my calves the next day I had blisters but the other girl that was with us had a dress so not sure if she had the same experience I did. 
It was and experience I'll never forget it was fun made sure we were hydrated all the time since it was a hot day. KC had included some pointer and history about the area that was interesting.

The minifridge was stocked badly and as soon as I opened the door, the little dessert cake fell onto the floor (an added $10 fee, btw).
The overpriced food menu was about right given the location. However, the service was terrible. We ordered coffee and waited 20 minutes for that to arrive with no silverware. While we were waiting for the food, or silverware, or water, the coffee went cold. An hour after we ordered, our food arrived and it was cold. My French toast was hard as a rock. 
In addition to all of this, which I expect at a lesser ranked hotel, we had an issue with the reservation fee. I booked using booking.com and saw on the resort website that they had a special rate for local guests. So, I called booking.com to cancel. They told me there was a $199 cancellation fee and I asked them to waive it since I would be booking directly with the hotel. Booking.com confirmed that the hotel would waive the fee, no problem.  As we go to check in, my debit card was rejected. I had plenty in my account, so I don't know what went on there. But, my fiancee paid for the room. I told him I'd transfer some $$ to him to help. As I'm checking my account, there is a $226.70 charge from the hotel on it. What?

We visited the place on a Tuesday night so not really super busy but busy enough that it did not seem we were the only ones there.

The menu is broad enough to make everyone happy and typical of Montreal an interesting wine and beer list.

Pricing is reasonable and may seem a bargain for this neighborhood

Service was attentive but the server doesn't really know too much about what they are serving.

I like to ask questions about the pizza oven, the process or even wine ideas or even trying to decode the actual pizza menu. She failed in all cases but her smile and positive attitude still won us over.

My buddy was shocked when the pizza arrived a few minutes later. Well yeah a 950 degree oven SHOULD kick a pizza out in a 2 minutes upon toppings placed for a real pompei oven.

So many places claim wood fired but the wood is nowhere to be found

14002,3,1547510400000,"Note that this is a review of their vegetarian dishes only. 

I went to Wvrst with some friends, we've been wanting to try it for a while. I wouldn't normally go to a sausage restaurant as I'm vegetarian, but my interest was piqued after viewing their menu and seeing that they, in fact, had a few vegetarian options that looked interesting. 

It's easy for a restaurant like this to shrug off vegetarians, so I appreciate the fact that they didn't. It's also easy for a place like this to have a ""token"" vegetairan dish that isn't really well thought through (i.e. a salad or something else that's not fitting with the restaurant's theme). This isn't the case here. 

I shared both of the vegetarian sausages on the menu (italian and paprika kielbasa) both ways. You can select any of their sausages and have it either as ""curry wvrst"" or on a bun. We had the italian as curry wvrst and the kilebasa on a bun. We also got the dirty vegetarian fries. Oh, and beer, we also had beer. 

The curry wvrst was good, but not great. I'm not sold on the way they served it: a cut up fried sausage with a small dipping bowl of curry sauce and a slice of toast. 

The sausage on a bun was great. You get to select two of four toppings (caramalized onions, sautéed jalapeños, saurkraut and sautéed sweet peppers). The bun was delicious, the sausage was very well done and the toppings added a perfect amount of flavour to accent the deliciousness of the kielbasa. I would order this again, definitely.

The dirty vegetarian fries were also pretty good. They were fries topped with caramelized onions, sautéed peppers and perhaps something like the curry sauce. The forks they came with were annoying - little wooden prongs like you would get at a chip stand. The forks were cute, but not very functional, and they're wasteful when a regular fork would be preferred. The large size was too big for two, but I don't know how small the small is. 

Dipping sauces are good, I had the wvrst house sauce and black pepper sauce. I would only get one next time since they were good, but not great. And a little pricey at $1 each (for what amounts to be about 2 tablespoons of mayonaise). 

The beer selection was also very very good. The beer was a bit pricey, but they have unique brews that you can't find many other places. 

Atmosphere was a bit loud, but the design is great. It's reminiscent of a German beer garten that you would find at Oktoberfest. There is a large table in the corner for parties that is more private. 

Oh, and a note to vegans: The vegetarian sausages are both vegan, but the bun isn't (it has eggs in it). Everything else vegetarian is vegan except for the mayonaise or yogurt based dipping sauces. 

And, all their sausages (including the vegetarian ones) are made by them, not a third party supplier. 

I would definitely recommend this place as something you should check out.",1
14003,3,1547856000000,"Gilleys used to be located at The New Frontier Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas before the place got demolished to dust.  In those days Gilleys featured not only a mechanical bull but also bikini mud wrestling. Cold Beer and Dirty Girls was the mantra and it was a trip to remember.
 So my excitement was peaked when i found out that the place had relocated to the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino.  However my excitement was short lived ( as was my peak) when i found out that the dirty girls wrestling in the mud had been replaced with senior citizens line dancing the night away. The term ""titty alert"" which had been used at many a mud wrestling events to describe a fighters wardrobe malfunction had turned into a ""old bitty alert"". To add insult to injury , the only person riding a bull was a thirty something year old male misfit from Brokeback Mountain. So with a broken spirit i had the hostess find the wife and I a table.  She was nice enough to sit us in a spot that overlooked the Vegas Strip, nice, but still not mud wrestling.  Gilleys specializes in BBQ and has always done a good job at it.  After reviewing the menu Simone and I started with Sweet Potato Fries served with molasses ketchup and a maple marshmallow dipping sauce. For some odd reason the marshmallow sauce was a light green ( i dare not ask why). It worked well with the crispy fries and probably would have worked just as well with a peanut butter sandwich.  The molasses ketchup was also good and Simone and I finished it all. For our Entrees Simone tried the house chili. It was average and light on the spice, and reminded me more of spaghetti sauce then it did chili.  I probably could have made some at my own house for a fraction of the cost and it would have been much better and i at least would have served it with some chips. For my own entree,  I choose the Classic Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was a huge portion of pulled pork piled high on a garlic toasted bun topped with creamy coleslaw. The pork was smoked perfectly and had great flavor and moistness.  However this did cause the bun below to quickly get soggy which was disappointing because the bun was very good before it turned to mush.  The fries that the sandwich was served with were some of the best i have had in a long time. They were super thin and super crispy and may have been the highlight of the plate.  Overall this version of Gilleys left me a little dissapointed. It still serves great BBQ ( and good fries) but the other offerings were lacking in flavor. I still prefer the Dirty Girls and Cold Beer days of old. I hope that some day the mudd will return and Gilleys will once again be a little more country and a little more dirty",2

I knew this place has been here for years, but always overlooked it till I stopped by when  food truck Just Rollin was parked here. (yes, I know I need a  ""I brake for food trucks"" bumper sticker, I swear). While waiting for my order, Mr. Just Rollin By said to check out the store while I was waiting. So I did!  Wow, they have everything you can dream of for cooking, baking and entertaining! Very good quality. Prices, so reasonable! Ended up buying some tea cups that Ive been looking high and low for!! For eighty cents each!! Yes!  I then made a mental note to come back.

On my latest visit I had more time to peruse through and check out the store a little more.  The supplies and kitchenware are categorized in sections so you will be able to figure out where the bakeware, server ware, kitchen utensils, beverage items, containers, pans, etc are.  Most items are tagged with their prices.  I scored a pair of elbow length oven mitts, thick cloth type, nice quality for just $7.50.  What a steal! Also they recently added a Yelp Deal...20% off your total purchase.  So be sure to check in and take advantage of it.

14022,3,1547078400000,"We had reservations for George's Brasserie on New Year's Eve at 8:15pm.  We were seated promptly and offered a four-course prix fixe menu.  I started with a Ruby Bulleit cocktail, which contained Bulleit bourbon, Pama liqueur, fresh lemon juice, and cranberry.  It was absolutely delicious and the warm notes of the bourbon worked perfectly with the other aspects of the cocktail.

For my starter I got lamb lollipops.  They were small but perfectly cooked midrare, had a nice rosemary flavor, and a tangy dijon sauce.  I love gamey meats but the lamb was very mild, which wasn't a bad thing.

The salad course was a caprese salad that was standard for everyone on the menu.  This course was bad enough to knock an entire star off of this review.  The best parts were the thin ribbons of basil and the balsamic reduction drizzled over it.  The tomatoes were mealy and flavorless, and I am 99% sure the ""fresh"" mozzarella came from a Bel Gioso bag straight from the supermarket.  It was tough, very cold, and flavorless.  I think a more winter-appropriate salad would have made more sense, as this course simply didn't work.

My main was venison, cooked midrare as well, and came with braised purple kale and a slightly sweet grape confit.  This course really worked well.  The braised kale was slightly acidic which played beautifully with the grape confit.  The venison itself was amazingly tender, and again, there was no hint of gaminess to the meat which I missed a little but I understand that most people like a more mild flavor.  The cauliflower garlic puree it was served over was okay - the texture was silky smooth but it didn't have much flavor.

For dessert, I chose pistachio profiteroles.  I was disappointed that when they came out, they were filled with pistachio ice cream, rather than a pastry creme or something with a nicer texture.  The ice cream was all right, but it tasted like your typical storebought pistachio ice cream.  Nothing to write home about, and the pastry itself was unremarkable.

Overall, this was a good meal.  The caprese salad was terrible, but at least everyone else had to share in our misery during that course.  The service was so-so...our server never introduced himself to us so I don't even know what his name was, and he seemed to be in a bit of a sour mood as he dropped our plates off at our table with barely a word.  At least he kept our wine glasses topped up.  This restaurant seems to have lost a little bit of its luster, but I don't know if it's just because it was New Year's Eve and they were slammed, or if it is more indicative of an overall drop in quality.  We'll certainly be back to find out.",3

I was initially really excited because they make fresh teftoon bread. As I've read some of the reviews the kabob was salty actually even the humus was salty. I had ordered the beef soltani and it was a bit dry and salty to my taste. 

The hummus was a bit chunky texture not smooth and full of olive oil like most really good hummus. They also gave you 4 small pieces of bread when you ordered the hummus, you need more bread for the amount of hummus you get, I can tell the hummus was made days before and stored in the fridge. It came in a styrofoam cup and lid and it was cold so they just grabbed it from the fridge.

14053,3,1547769600000,"This was hands down the worst, most frustrating, and most confusing legal experience I have ever had. Bottom line: Don't make my mistake - steer clear of this law office.

When I first went in for a consult, my meeting with one of the attorneys was in the waiting area, not an office. (I suppose this should have been clue #1.) I explained the situation. He then explained the process (which would turn out to be completely wrong). And he concluded with ""it could be all said and done by Friday"".

Well, ok, by the end of the week sounded great to me (naive, I know). And while the cost seemed high, it's not like I'd done this before (so how was I supposed to know). So I went ahead and gave them 1/2 the money and waited.

And waited. And waited. And waited. And then it was back and forth over email (yes, email) with a different attorney to get all the legal documents squared away. Am I the only one who thinks email is not the best form of communication in such a situation? One in-person meeting could have gotten everything straight the first time (or maybe not given the incompetency of this firm?). Not to mention all the spelling errors throughout the docs. Shouldn't legal docs be void of at least spelling errors?! It took almost 1.5 months to get the completed legal docs. 1.5 months! ""By Friday"" my ass.

So I come into the office to review the docs. I assume I will be reviewing them with one of the attorneys (which is what the attorney I was emailing with led me to believe). But no, I am sitting in the waiting area and having the receptionist hand me the docs to read. The same docs I already received (and read) via email. Not helpful. I wind up asking the receptionist questions, who then goes into one of the attorney's offices to ask the questions, and then comes back to give me the answers. Um, perhaps I could just talk to my attorney directly? But no. And one of the attorneys comes out to the receptionist's desk to hand her something. He clearly knows who I am and that I am there and that I have questions. But he doesn't even so much as acknowledge me. I'm sorry, but that really is not normal lawyer behavior (especially considering how much I was paying).

So after more waiting and back and forth, all of the docs are finally signed and ready to be filed. The receptionist calls me to find out what days I am available for court. I tell her and she tells me she will get back to me ASAP, she usually gets the 1st choice of dates for clients, etc. So I walk around all week assuming I will have a court date the following week. Days go by and I hear nothing. I call the office every day and speak to another person. (I don't know what this person does, but my dog could answer the phones better). This other person never knows anything about anything.

After a couple of weeks, I get a call from the receptionist - laughing like what she is about to tell me is the funniest thing in the world - telling me that the attorneys keep forgetting to take the docs to court with them to drop off. Um, definitely not a laughing matter. What on earth am I paying this firm for again? Absolutely unacceptable! At this point, I just want to demand a refund and walk away entirely. Not only is it not ""by Friday"", but it is MONTHS later. I could have done all of this on my own faster and for way less money.

So fast forward to when I finally get a court date. I am told absolutely nothing other than ""Pecos and Bonanza"". The receptionist couldn't even tell me the exact address, let alone what would happen in court, if I needed to bring anything with me, etc.

I show up at the appointed day and time. Talk to a nice security guy at the info booth and go sit outside a courtroom. And then the attorney I met with (different from the attorney I emailed with) shows up and asks who I am. I know it's been a couple of months - even though he told me ""by Friday"" when we first met - but shouldn't attorneys at least remember their clients? And hey, I didn't even know an attorney would be showing up. I was told nothing about what to expect! And then the attorney asks me where my witness is. Witness? What witness? I almost burst into tears at this point. And the attorney is making zero sense and having me call the receptionist on my phone. What kind of lawyer doesn't have their own phone? And the receptionist is saying something else entirely and telling me not to listen to the attorney. OMG.

So it finally sorta all works out and I am left waiting for the filed documents with the judge's signature. The receptionist calls me to tell me when she hasn't seen anything. But she neglects to call me when the documents are filed and signed. And both she and the attorney mention coming in to pick them, but when I call, the other person tells me I can't have the certified copy because they like to keep that copy. So I have to go back to court and pay for a certified copy. Seriously? After all that money I paid this firm?

Absolutely incompetent. Not worth it.",2

The shrimp phad thai was tasty but looked and tasted like imitation phad thai equipped with phad thai sauce, stay away

The beef with glass noodles was also billed as spicy but sadly disappointed, lets just say yelp will accompany all of my future orders, anywhere",3

If you want beautiful, natural-looking highlights, get Balayage (hand-painted highlights). If you want the best Balayage highlights in the valley, go to Erin Fink.

To say I'm picky about my hair stylist is an understatement. I have extremely curly, extremely dry (and damaged), frizzy, kinky, unruly hair. It's a lion's mane. So when I decide I want to do something to it, I do literally months of research. What salon to go to, what products to use, what color dye (by number) to ask for, and most importantly, what stylist to trust my locks to. I researched for about 14 months via Yelp, Instagram, asking friends, etc. All roads led to Erin. My hair has never looked so good (seriously) and healthy. The fact that the entire service, cut and color, only takes 90 minutes doesn't hurt either (I'm used to sitting 3-4 hours in the chair for highlights and a cut).

This place isn't fancy and the service is almost cafeteria-style. If you want a sandwich, you fill out a little chit and highlight what you'd like on it. Then, they give you a table number and deliver your lunch to your table. The service is quick and the quality of the food is always consistently solid. Their fresh-baked breads and other baked goods are what keep you coming back.

The menu could use a bit of a face-lift, but overall this place is a great little coffee house and bakery. I often buy a loaf of bread to take home as I am on my way out the door.

The worst thing about this place is the parking. It's a tiny little lot and many of the spots are 1-hour only.",2

He got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and I got a mahi sandwich.  Both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  There were tons of things on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying.

We are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!

You would think that after so many people complaining of the long wait in the drive thru somebody would do something about it. Obviously they could care less about customer service and how long it takes to service a customer at this location. Someone should really look at the management at this location because they are doing a horrible job at making sure customers are serviced in a fair amount of time through the drive-thru.

The nachos came out at a decent time but the rolls came out after we were about finished eating. We had to wait another 20 mins for the waiter to get back with our bill so we could leave.

I could barely eat more than a few bites of it. The pork was dry and bland, and the sauce did not do anything to help. (Brought it home and gave it to the boyfriend.) Luckily, there were some potato chips on the table, so that saved me from being hungry. I did try my friend's paella though and it was fine. 

Still, great service (a very lively ""happy birthday"" sung to my friend, among other things), and I enjoyed the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the restaurant. Just wish my meal were a lot better.

I usually go to borracha but I wanted to try somewhere different, upon arrival I found the decor to be awesome ! I loved the octopus tacos I enjoyed everything we tried but this tacos stood out and were my favorite! I appreciate the presentation and elegance that Bandito puts into their food. Service was a little slow and somewhat unfriendly and then around 9pm  they began a after party I guess but the DJ was more annoying than anything. It got too loud and the music being played ruined my experience. The place was pretty empty so I don't get the loud DJ music? The men smoking hookah outside bothering every girl that walked by made for an uncomfortable feeling. I wanted to enjoy food and drinks at a restaurant if I want to hear a DJ and be harassed I'll go to a nightclub! I don't get that whole concept. Overall I give the decor a 5 star , food a 4.5 star and service a 3 star. I thought it was a cool place I would have stayed longer and spent more money but the ""after party"" made me reconsider. I will go back for the food but I'll do it before 9pm.

14169,3,1546473600000,"One of the most disgusting meals I have seen lately. I was skeptical to come here in the first place, and I I wish that my perception was what ruined the experience for me.  My MIL loves the orange chicken from here and since she was visiting, we stopped by to get her an order. And decided to get a combo platter to test some things out. 
MIL enjoyed the orange chicken. She did not enjoy her fried rice- which she said she usually does.. so these issues may be just the location?

Basically the fried rice and the lo mein sides were inedible. Like as in, are those styrofoam noodles or real? I mean, I never meant a noodle or fried rice I couldn't eat but this was the moment!! Disgusting. The entrees we tried were super meh. The fried general tso's was 'fine' because it's fried meat covered in sweet sauce. Sooo hard to get wrong. Same thing with the orange chicken. 
Beef with broccoli was just broccoli. I was seriously just curious what the beef even looked like. Good chunks of broccoli though, if you are into it!

Overall, I thought this might be a nice hangover spot (drive-thru clutch) and random pregnancy cravings. Um, no. Save yourself the horror and make your own fried rice (so easy and not disgusting!).",2

Service. Amazing. Very attentive and pleasent. We where able to enjoy our meal without the server on our backs every minute, but felt they where knowlegable and there if we needed anything. I wish service in this city could always be like this.

Food. The food was amazing. I've been to Italy several times, and the pizza here was better than any I've had there. Dessert was incredible as well, so save room. 

The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 and not 5 is because as mentioned by others, I do feel that some items where way too small for the price. The cured meats being the most rediculous. At that price, there better be more than 4 slivers of each. Pizza was the best bang for buck and besides desset, I feel was the highlight. I had a few other dishes, I can't recall all of them now, but they where all really good.

I say this is a great restaurant to go to and a great adition to the area. Dinner for 2 ran us around $250.00, so it is pretty steep. But all in all, I'd say it's worth a visit.",1

A lot of people recommended the gnocchi as an appetizer and let me tell you it was AMAZING. It was so good we ate it all before I could snap a picture. I would probably order it as my entree next time I enjoyed it so much. My boyfriend ordered the braised beef with polenta which tasted great. Very flavorful. I ordered the veal breast. Our server warned me ahead of time that it was a rich piece of meat, and not too lean. I ordered it anyways and let me tell you she was spot on. Don't get me wrong it tasted fantastic and I liked it a lot, but it's definitely something you have to be in the mood for.

My friend and I ordered the same wine and she requested a taste; He brought us both a taste - a nice touch I thought.  Our service was great and we were treated as if we were ordering a full dinner.  No attitude that we were only having wine.

The service at Chinato is clearly top notch;  Our waiter at our ""red"" restaurant was attentive but the hostesses seemed to be bothered my our appearance at the hostess stand.  We commented we should have eaten at Chinato.

14235,2,1548720000000,"I am never going to debate with friends/family on where we go for sushi.. Sakana surpasses every AYCE sushi place in Vegas in taste, fish:rice ratio, freshness, food options, alcohol prices, service and atmosphere. I lived in Japan for 16 years- I know my sushi. (Obviously it's not Japanese style sushi, but if you don't compare it to that- it's really, really good)
1. Drive up to the Target complex on Maryland- the restaurant is on the Eastern side of Target, almost behind it. 
2. Appreciate the atmosphere. One wall looks straight off of a rustic country living DIY Pinterest board, another a Studio Ghibli and animation shrine, another a fancy teppanyaki restaurant and finally a bathroom all about Hello Kitty and everything kawaii. 
3. Start with the Baked Green Mussel appetizer. These mussels were FAT. The red sauce has a slight kick, but I wouldn't call it spicy. I could eat an entire meal of these. 
4. Fill up with nigiri. The fish to rice ratio is perfect here. The rice itself isn't necessarily smaller, but instead the slices of fish are bigger. Fresh, fresh, fresh. There's no fishy smell or the overly dyed fish you might get at other restaurant. They offered a few lake fish (non-Ocean) as nigiri, which I had not previously tried before. Interesting, but good. You won't find that in Japan! 
5. Start your AMRAP or As Many Rolls As Possible. The rolls are smaller and each roll is crafted artistically and not just thrown together. The No Name, Wet Dream, Bam Bam roll were my favorite, but there were not any rolls that I didn't like. 
6. HONEY TOAST FOR DESSERT. Need I say anymore? Sakana is the first AYCE sushi restaurant that I have seen offer this. Don't bother with the tiramisu, mochi icecream (both were good) Honey Toast always wins.

I asked for a medium latte and she makes it first, then charges me for a large. I told her, ""oh I asked for a medium"", and she just replies, ""well I already made it"" and just blankly stares at me until I pay for a large. Good service, lady. It's no wonder the coffee shop was empty.",2

In addition to the local meats, DJ's has Brunton Farms. Their varieties come in these big glass jugs, and I have to grab one every time I stop in. The 2% Chocolate Milk is a dream.

My only issue with DJ's is their credit card policy. You can only pay with a card over a certain amount, and even then there is a fee. No worries though, there's a Citizen's Bank ATM down the street that I frequent before grabbing meats.",1

For the first time in 5 years I had relief from pain! He uses a combined technique of different massage styles and also gentle stretching.

This was my first time using MM and I will NEVER use them again. Such a rip off! I was quoted at $70 an hour (min 1.5 hrs, the quote said it would be between 1.5 and 2 hours to clean the space I asked about) and told that two people would come to clean my home. They asked the sqft and I told them it was 1600, but not the whole place would be cleaned. I just needed 2 bathrooms, 1 bedroom, living room, kitchen and dining room (which only has a dining table in it). 

3 women showed up and took 3 hours to clean!!!!!! They also charged me extra for the 3rd person!!! There is NO WAY it should've taken that long and I should never have been charged for an extra person. To make matters worse, their customer service is AWFUL. When I called to express concern I got no sympathy and NO APOLOGY and the guy just argued with me. He also mentioned that they charge $65/hr (so why was I quoted $70 and charged OVER $70?! - $245 total for 3 hours - we couldn't even question the cleaners as they didn't speak enough English). 

Seriously lacking in customer service - had he not been such a jerk and at least TRIED to make me happy or even just ACTED like he cared I wouldn't be swearing MM off forever. 

I was lied to and ripped off and really caution against using this company.",1

We had two of the best waiters (Paul and Edward) you could ask for.  They were very knowlegeble of the menu and knew the details of how the food choices would be prepared.

Nothing but attitude from the girl with the blond hair who would rather talk to her boyfriend sitting at the bar.

Another complaint is their loyalty system. I've had their stamp cards since day one, I tried to ask for a stamp and the staff member pointed me to a QR code to download an app. I don't use a QR scanner so the staff member advised me to search ""diandiangoal"" upon downloading the app - nothing was in English so therefore I couldn't sign up. That's honestly too much work and I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.

When I asked for sauce I was told its $1.50 extra!  For sauce? Are they joking? And it turns out the sauce wasn't even good!  
I'll stick with Rio Rico Mexican Grill in Gilbert.  I've been going there for 8 years (since I moved to AZ) and everything is awesome there!  You also don't get charged extra for sauce or salsa and chips there!",2

After I called they said that the representative made a mistake because they dont service my area that day. 
I reschedule for my next day that I was available (about 5 days later) I specificly advised them that It needed to be before 2pm because I had a shift that day. I get no call and nobody shows up. Then the tech calls at 3:30pm and said he was at my front door. WTH!!!!

1. The prices have always been the most reasonable for the area (for everything I've ever needed). 
2. They get the car in at the scheduled time and go as fast as they can, and are very good about keeping you updated.
3. The service people are really nice. Especially David in the service department! David has always greeted me with a smile, a great attitude, and has been super super helpful. He has also been very accommodating because I have to bring my one year old with me to all these repairs. One time he even brought out a phone charger for me to borrow when I realized my battery was on 5%. (Really above and beyond here).
4. They have a very nice and clean hang out area for little kids equipped with ipads, a tv, toys, and some colorful chairs. This is a HUGE plus when you have to wait around for your car.
5. They offer shuttle service for when the repair could take a while. 
6. It's also really nice that they have free coffee, water, popcorn, etc. 

Overall, I'm just super pleased with the service and work that is done here. I've never been able to say this about any dealer before. And I'll be getting all my work done here including regular maintenance and oil changes. AND when it does come time to buy a new vehicle, I'm coming here first!",2

I definitely agree with the good reviews this place gets, the food is great and for a great price!
We were the only ones there on a weekend at dinner time, so this place definitely doesn't get the traffic it deserves, but its definitely one of the city's hidden gems. The

I even went back and brought a group of my co-workers here. We all had the lunch special that comes with a spring roll and bowl of soup, all for about ~$8 and they loved it too.

The only negative thing I have to say is that the waitress that served us (both times I went) was not very courteous with us. She just takes our order and leaves, no smile. Once there was a piece of plastic wrap in my friend's cup; we told the waitress and she just took her cup and exchanged it with no apology.

The place seem really big on the inside. The dance for was kind of small and I wish they had more restrooms. 

We came here on a Saturday night, It was really busy, and lot of people were on the dance floor getting their two step on. They had a live band that sounds really good. Not much for drink speicals though. If you plan on drinking a lot you might want to plan on spending some extra mula.

I normally would have ordered there spicy turkey burger in the past but this was no longer an option. I asked the bartender if I could get there mushroom Swiss burger, but with a turkey burger and make it spicy. She said no problem. When I got back to my desk I opened my to go box and it looked very good visually. It also tastes excellent. Perfectly cooked. Not too dry (like some turkey burgers can turn out) and not undercooked.

We split a pumpkin pancake, and a cinnamon bun pancake. The pumpkin was great, but the cinnamon bun was still completely raw in the middle, like, oozing batter, which was gross.

It looks like a mom/daughter team is running the place of late (which one is Tisha?), and it's basically become a typical diner. They do have takeout which is the route I took (I was on my way to work) on this particular day.  

I chose something that was quick to make since I didn't give myself enough time (urgh!), so I went with a BLT. A show on Food Network got me thinkin' bacon anyway (an episode of 'The Best Thing I Ever Ate' to be exact), so I was in the mood.

It was pretty goshdarn good. The bacon was cooked well and was abundant. The lettuce was crisp, the tomato slices thick, the spongy white bread serving its purpose well. 

It comes with fries, and fat fingers of fried love they were. I mean, these were steak fries; Kennywood fries turned monstrous! 

A co-worker asked me during my pre-shift meal, ""Where'd ju get dem fries man?"" 

They're icebreakers! . 

I'll have to try their burgers next. They also have breakfast and will even make pies to order with a 2 day notice.

The only meat that I eat is seafood so I opted for the vegetarian burger. I literally never would've known that it was not real beef and I kid you not. Best vegetarian burger I've ever had. There were so many choices on the menu but I was happy with her recommendations. I really like the atmosphere and it's great that you can actually bring kids because there's video games that they can be playing while you are sitting at a table or the bar and also enjoying yourself.

They have everything from yogurt to frozen tamales to fresh tortillas.... I ended up buying a half loaf of bread for 2$ (which is an awesome idea BTW... sometimes you don't need a whole loaf), a jar of tahini (priced cheaper than at the grocery), and some locally roasted coffee (cortez).

The hostess then spoke to the manager in mandarin saying that a table will be leaving soon. A new customer rushes in and starts speaking to the hostess and manager, thus shoving us aside. We waited there for a bit, until I decided to interrupt and ask the hostess if there was a table available. The response was just a blunt no, didn't try to accommodate us in any way. Mind you this whole time they were under the impression that I didn't understand chinese, but I heard clearly the hostess telling the manager that a table will be leaving soon.

14537,2,1548201600000,"Upon arriving we were a bit early (check-in is at 4pm) and arrived a little after 2pm.  The desk clerk told us she had a room ready but it was not our regular room which would not be ready until 4pm so we waited for a few hours by walking around the mall that was attached to the hotel.  We were supposed to receive a text message when our room was ready but never did so went to the lobby again around 4:15pm, waited in line once again & finally got our room....which was the same exact room that was offered to us at 2pm!  ugh

Okay so the automatic shades didn't work in our room & the technician could not fix them so they had to stay down the entire time we were there.   There was no battery in the tv remove control either.  We had to call for one.  They ended up offering us a new room on day 2 but we were already settled in & only had one more night to stay so we just kept the shade down.

The room seemed nice on first inspection in that we had a big jacuzzi tub near the bed.  The bathroom was large, however, when I opened the cabinet to get the hair dryer out there was dust & mold inside of the cabinet near the wall.  There's a shelf in there & the dryer had fallen behind the shelf so I had to stick my head in there to get it & it was filthy and moldy.

The room was dirty. VERY DIRTY.  I've attached a picture of the table where I wrote ""HI"" in the dust.  Our bed was made every day, linens were clean & the towels changed but that's about it.  The extra pillows that we had taken off the bed were left on the lounge chair & not placed back on the bed.  We would have taken them off again anyway but it seems like ""housekeeping"" is somewhat disgruntled.  No vacuuming, no dusting, etc.  Besides being dirty the decor was atrocious & the wallpaper peeling off in the bathroom.  The carpet is black so if you have black shoes don't leave them on the floor, especially if your shades have malfunctioned & won't go up. You'll never be able to see them unless you accidentally kick them or bring a floodlight along with you on your trip.

The microwave oven didn't work.  I put my Starbucks coffee in there to reheat it & all that happened was that the cup almost caught on fire & the coffee was still cold.  Super hot cardboard cup & cold coffee.

They did give me a $25 credit for the inconvenience of the shades not working & no battery in the remote.  I was able to get a martini & a coffee out of that.  I stopped complaining after the shades stopped working.  I didn't even tell them about the dirt, mold, dust & microwave because we had already decided that we would never stay here again.

There are homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk at night on Harmon outside of the hotel in the planter alcoves.  We counted 5 one night on our walk back to our room.

There isn't much soundproofing.  You can hear everything that goes on in the street, people, cars, fire engines, etc.

The room was inexpensive for us because we were invited to a HHonors timeshare presentation.  The timeshare presentation was more like a ""prison-tation"" where you simply cannot leave until they excuse you & you sign out. They ask you  to write a down payment check that day. Crazy!  I finally had to demand to be allowed to leave after almost 3 hours. You have to be escorted out with your sales consultant.  If you leave without the proper protocol you'll be charged $200 extra for your stay which you've already paid for in advance, albeit at a discount.  We were asked during the prison-tation ""Don't you trust Hilton?""  ba ha ha

This hotel shares a parking structure with Planet Hollywood & the Miracle Mile Mall.  You have to walk a long way to get to the hotel and go into the mall to find an elevator to the 3rd floor.  This is awful if you want to bring groceries.  They don't allow you to take a bell cart out of the hotel to retrieve your luggage so you have to carry everything.

Wifi is weak & we kept getting kicked off & had to re-enter our code time and time again.  My key card stopped working 3 times & they wouldn't bring me a new one.  I had to stand in line each time to get a new card.

 I've been to Vegas more times than I can remember or count and I've never had such a poor experience in a Hotel that is supposed to be high end.  In the past we have only ever stayed at the Hilton in Vegas but they sold that Hotel some years ago. I'm not sure what's going on with Hilton on this one.  This is so unlike the Hilton quality we have been used to.  Sad, really sad.  So very disappointed.

Motel 6 has better service, is cleaner and has working electronic gadgets.  Hilton Elara people, please don't tell me how you are going to make my next stay better.  You've had enough complaints here on yelp to know how to fix your problems yet you are still having them? Don't count on our return.  If this is how you sell timeshares you need a better marketing plan. smh",2

We waited about 15 minutes, which seemed odd since the hallway outside Maison Kam Fung was packed.  Service was friendly, though. When we changed our mind about the high chair, they cheerfully took it back.   I'd take this kind of service any day over the kind of service we get in Richmond, BC.  These elements make Maison Kam Fung a 3 star for us.  More shrimp than you can shake a stick out, which was great for our vegetarian member of our party.  Still, I'm baffled why we never saw an egg tart on any of the carts during our hour there.  Maybe we had to special order it through our server.",2
14576,2,1548633600000,"Sooner or later Yelp will add the ability to add half-stars..2 1/2 would be this rating.

My friend had been raving about this for the past few visits I have made to Canada. So, going into it I really wanted to like this place,  she ate (not in this location mind you) at the KGH many times before and had nothing but fantastic stories to tell about it.  We arrived on a busy Saturday afternoon for their 8.95 all you can eat lunch. Right off the bat we were thrown a curve ball when we were informed if 1 person wants something, it would apply to everyone in terms of billing.  IE, my buddy wanted to add veggies, for 3 dollars, but the server said that it would apply to everyone. I can see where they don't want you to share meals,  but when someone definitely will not be using something they shouldn't be charged for it.  

The marinated Pork, Chicken and Beef were excellent, The Fish and Squid were not really worth our time.  We learned quickly that the first few items we cooked tasted excellent, then after that all we tasted was the carbon char of the grill. My friend pointed out that normally at the other location she eats at there are guys constantly scraping down the cooking surface for you in order to keep your grilling experience top notch.  After about 30 minutes, we were still hungry, but the plate was mostly black. We had to flag down one of the servers and ask them to change out the platter so we could continue. On top of not being able to flag down a server initially, they became very scarce all of a sudden. The initial person who took our orders, wasn't the one that got our drinks, and the one that got our drinks wasn't the one who changed our meat dishes, and the one that changed the meat dishes wasn't the one who took our order for milkshakes, (which btw took 15 minutes to get). It was all very confusing, almost like they didn't have any order and this was just chaos. (I mean, who gets the tip if 7 people did things for us?)

Towards the end of the meal even my friend said that she was not too thrilled about this place. The food was good, the service was subpar,  I would have liked to have what my friend wanted to give me. I don't know if it was because it was lunch time or not,  but giving people the ability to keep their grills cleaner or having someone do it for you would have made this a much tastier trip. Her and I will go to the other location for dinner in a few weeks when I am back up there again.",2

There are a number of dishes that I love, but I don't really know the names - I have them written down in Chinese - but more often than not I just ask my friends to pick something. I've never been let down.

The employees at the register are also very helpful in finding something to suit your palette. (There's never a shortage of spicy food at my table).  The full menu is available as an English menu as well.

The staff also provides a ""free"" item as well. If you order 4 entrees, you will get 5 dishes (maybe an appetizer, maybe an entree).

Keep in mind - you go here for the food. The atmosphere is simple. Large room, lots of tables. But you just cant beat the food at any other Chinese restaurant in the area.

14583,3,1547337600000,"Realistically, I'd probably give Tomo 3.5 stars, but as that's not an option I'll go with 4, because I did really love the sushi. 

I went to Tomo with my SO and a Groupon in hand on a Friday evening. We absolutely love sushi and had never been here, so we were pretty excited. Walking in, I did not see what I had expected to see. For the prices of the sushi (special rolls hovering around $20 or slightly less) I expected something a bit more upscale. I'm not a fancy gal whatsoever, the place simply was not what I expected. So I guess that's number one: be warned, the prices do not match the atmosphere. 

Our server was nice. However, and I hate to say it, she honestly seemed like she was ""on something"". It took her several seconds to process everything we were saying, she spoke very slowly and almost slurred, and just didn't seem...""right"". I try to give the benefit of the doubt (who knows, maybe it was just a bad day), but I was honestly worried about her. That being said, we did get all our food and drinks in a good amount of time. 

The sushi was fresh and delicious. The presentation was beautiful. We got the black dragon roll, the sexy girl roll, and one with a few types of tuna that I can't remember the name of. I can't pick which was my favorite! They were all great. 

Overall: loved the sushi but most likely won't be back due to the price not matching the experience. I can find cheaper sushi with the same experience.",2

14588,1,1548028800000,"Cuttlefish is in the Shops at Gainey Village. A hop, skip and a jump away from my one of the places I work. Alas, I waited for the busiest nights to test the newest seafood joint. (A band was playing outside.) I was surprised then when our party was greeted like part of their extended Italian family.

""Hmm. Better return for my *own* experience."" Turns out Cuttlefish offers a familial experience to everyone. (Smooches, hugs by Vincinza and Gino!) I later asked my friends how many times they had visited to warrant such fanfare. (Once.) I returned the next day for some more love. The food was that unbelievable.

Then I learned about their killer HH. (2pm-8pm!) Details at the end. Dangerous information.

FOOD
So the food. Hoh. My. Goodness. If I could cook it would be like this. But since I can't (shh) I would eat here all the time. After careful deliberation (too many mouth watering choices) I devoured the sea scallops. They're served on a delightful bed of risotto. The scallops were gingerly cooked to perfection, topped with bacon and a jam of sorts. My Instagram title for the photo is ""Orgasmic"". Yep. Paired with a simple salad of mixed greens (which was generously sized) I was stuffed. 

....and yet....Our table shared a dessert called Cassata. Sweet goat cheese was whipped into a surprising treat. I say ""our table"" but really that means I ate most of it :) Gino, who waited on us like a cousin, suggested an excellent bottle of Italian pinot noir by Candoni.

DESIGN
The exterior of the restaurant offers wonderful, refined table dining. The interior of the restaurant is designed with Italy in mind. The oyster bar is surrounded with Vespas. Yes, Vespas! Cutest thing ever. (Seriously, have a peek at my photos.) The main dining area offers plenty of seating options. Four top tables with chairs sprinkle the center area. Booths line the walls. The booths are for 1-2 adults. The bar area also offers high top seating. This is a place to impress!

CUTTLEFISH?
Oh, you have to try it. Calamari lovers will rejoice. This is better! I needed some schooling so I asked my waiter Matt for the 411. A Cephalopod is any member of the molluscan class Cephalopoda. (Props to Matt for being able to spell that for me.) These buggers are characterized by bilateral body symmetry, a prominent head and a set of tentacles. Sometimes cuttlefish are called inkfish, referring to their common ability to squirt ink. Boom.

Cuttlefish, the restaurant, flies their speciality in *all* the way from Sicily. They weigh, on average, 23 lbs.

MUY IMPORTANT
HH is 2-8pm! (Woooot!) $3 off the bar menu. $3 off glasses of wine. $3 off specialty drinks. Bottles of wine are 30% off.

Salads can easily become dull afterthoughts, but not so here--they are generously portioned, with quality lettuces and a variety of deliciously fresh add-ins.  The Cobb salad was presented as a veritable mini buffet of proteins, veggies, and cheese.  Every element was totally tasty and the sum was very filling.

The lemon and chocolate mousse plates were also quite strong, especially when ordered together and sampled in alternating bites!  ORD has obviously become a staple of the Hudson dining scene, but it seems to continue to put out a dependably good product.",1

Appointments were made well in advance for each of us and we specifically asked that there would be enough staff to take us at 11:30. None of us were taken at 11:30. The first in our group was taken after 12 and it went from there. We did not get out of there until 2:30. I paid $77 for a gel mani and pedi when the price posted was $60-65. Not sure what the up charge was for and didn't feel like arguing. My gel mani didn't even last two weeks without chipping. I will never return.,2
14717,3,1548806400000,"This place is absolutely horrible.
I called 4 days in advance to confirm my reservation and to make sure all my guests were on the list as well as to confirm a two bedroom. 
We arrive at noon and I try to see if we can check in. I was told to wait until 130 so we did. 
At 1, they said to make two lines - one for people who would like a king bedroom and one for two queens. We were told by a rep that the King beds would be checked in first and the Queen beds would be checked in at 4. 
So we leave our place in the ""king bed"" line and go over to the two queen. 2 hours later, we find out the move was unnecessary, we got skipped by over 50 people, only two out of three guests were checked in and they couldn't rectify it or else they'd charge us $15 extra each night. 
When I asked to see a manager about the situation, we waited an additional 30 minutes to see someone who did not know anything about the situation, blamed it on another manager and said she'd call me if she hears anything. They did not even offer to comp us our resort fee for waiting (standing, we were told to get up from sitting on the floor) for 3.5 hours. 
ON TOP OF ALL THAT, I booked a room with a view (in September of 2015) and we get a concrete slab in front of us.

The food quality is really okay, it kind of lack that authentic Korean taste. A bit overpriced for what it's worth. The service is very friendly, but needs some improvements. It seems like the servers spent most of their efforts and time on cooking the meats for the tables, and shorten the level of service in other areas. It took about 20 minutes for them to finally come take our order and same for the table next to us.

seated on the other section on the far end side, our table has 2 service button on each end to call for service. Service is fast, staffs are friendly and nice.

We ordered the medium combo platter which consists of 28pcs assorted sashimi and 28pcs mixture of sushi and rolls, $49.95. Also got the classic maki platter which has dynamite roll, spicy tuna roll and California maki roll total 27 pcs $27.95. Sashimi are fresh and portion is good. Spicy tuna maki is really spicy! The only thing i didn't like is the rice on the maki or sushi, it's kinda dry. These platters came with fried crunchy seaweed(oily), miso soup, noodles with miso soup in a teacup(love this) and Japanese salad(fresh) . We also ordered Tempura shrimp(disappointingly small), Gyoza(taste good but just ordinary), and Kanpoongi (korean chicken with sweet spicy sauce). The Kanpoongi came out hot and really spicy so we ordered additional rice to go with it and I enjoyed having it together, really good.

Yes, this is one of those movie theaters: a real one that hasn't been made into one of the indistinguishable AMC/Marcus/etc. theaters. They serve real popcorn with real butter, booze, and other fine snackies.

You reserve your seats, huzzah! There's a nice little cafe area where you can sit at proper tables and have your food if you wish, or you can bring it with you into the theater. The seats are all fairly comfortable--if a tad worn--and you aren't sitting on top of your neighbors.

They don't play endless ads at deafening volumes prior to the movie starting, and I was surprised by how few previews they played as well. This upset me a little because I love previews, so 20 minutes of them usually doesn't bother me. Oh, well. 

The only downside is, if you do want to go sit in the theater and wait, you can't because they play everything so close together there's only just enough time to do the cleaning. Curious.

I will gladly come back here to see a movie the next time I'm in Madison. Definitely worth the little bit of an extra drive to the other side of town.",2

14776,2,1548374400000,"In true Vegas fashion, I was with a group of guy friends and we were deciding were to eat for dinner. We said either a) we're eating at McDonald's or b) we're going to keep gambling until we're each up at least $50 and go eat a nice steak dinner. 

The latter happened, and we ended up dining like kings at Gallagher's. 

To be honest, I really enjoyed our meal here. We started off with the clams, which were AMAZING to the point that I wanted to drink the broth. I even requested the server to leave the broth after all the clams were eaten so I could soak it up with bread. Too much? Maybe. 

In terms of main courses, the steak portions are huge. I shared a NY Strip Steak (which was phenomenal) with a side of mashed potatoes, and left full and happy. If you're picky about how your steak is cooked, I would suggest going a step up from what you usually order. i.e. I like my steak on the rare side, so we ordered a medium, which was really a medium rare. 

Another trick to note: my friend wanted bacon and cheese for his baked potato, and our server ended up bringin out two large bowls of bacon and cheese for the table to share. Such an added, delightful bonus to the meal. Because in my humble opinion, bacon makes the world go round. 

In terms of ambience (New York/Hollywood legends), the price (moderate), the service (great), and quality of food (outstanding), you can't go wrong with Gallagher's for your Las Vegas dining experience.",2

I ordered with very friendly Oliver. He makes you feel welcome and as if you're in his home. After I had placed my order and sat down, he brought our food to the table. 

I opted for a Quiche Lorraine with Salad ($7). The quiche was delicious. Definitely one of the better quiches I've had in town. The salad was nice, too.

We were treated by the hostess and promptly seated at a table for two right next to the fish tank.  Amazing view.  Edward was our waiter and incredible helpful and personable.  We had the poke as an appetizer and it was so beautifully played, I had to take a picture.  This was my first experience with poke and I will certainly have it again!  It filled all the flavor and textures I could want.  For dinner my hubby ordered the Tour de Shrimp and it consisted of coconut shrimp, stuffed shrimp, and shrimp with a chimichurri sauce.  He ate every bite!  I had the sea bass.  It was so perfectly cooked!  Fresh and flavorful.  During our meal the executive chef came by to see if everything was to our liking and it certainly was!  Then the manager came by with an anniversary card signed by our entire waitstaff!!!!  I couldn't believe it!  THEN, Edward presented us with menus that were made just for us and it said Happy 5th anniversary!!!!  I was blown away.  The topper to the whole night was when Edward came back and gave us a complimentary dessert of a peanut butter pie with a cookie crust.

14879,2,1547164800000,"I was prepared to give this location 4-stars because our appetizers came out pretty tasty for the most part. 

I was a fan of the calamari mixed with fried veggies mixed in. However, the sauce was pretty mediocre and its appearance was literally the closest resemblance to vomit as anything I've ever seen.  Really, the calamari sauce looks like pure vomit.  I can't emphasize enough how much the chef needs to change this.  It's appearance is disgusting.

The Brussel Sprouts weren't bad, but they were very oily.  My mother, who is a fan of Pizza Hut pan Pizza, complained about how oily they were.  That should tell you something.  Tasty, but extremely oily. 

The free garlic bread with Yelp check in was good.  I was a fan. No complaints other than the fact it was left on our bill even though it was supposed to be free. A small mishap, but if you're reading this, be sure to make sure at the end of the meal that they aren't accidentally charging you for items that are supposed to be free via promotions.  

Things were good enough so far to merit a maybe 4-Star review. But then came the Pizza.  

I'm a Pizza fan.  It might be my favorite food.  I've gone above and beyond to find and appreciate good pizza, but I'm also guilty of loving trashy pizzas.  I'll scarf down papa johns and Pizza Hut no problem.  And if I want a late night fix at home, for some reason, Tombstone Pepperoni Pizza really understands me.  Maybe I should be embarrassed by this. I'm not. I love tombstone pepperoni pizza for some reason.  The little pepperoni nuggets hidden in the sauce are magic for me. I digress. 

This pizza was not good and not terrible. I got the calabrese.  The waiter said, for him, it was by far the best pizza on the menu.  It was ok, I guess.  Slightly bland.  Which is impressive in a bad way because it lists quite a number of not-bland ingredients.  Peppers, meatballs, what appeared to be some kind of chimichurri sauce laced over the toppings.  It looked really good. It wasn't.  It was meh. I'd rather eat a tombstone oven pizza with Tabasco on it.  The price is outrageous.  $17 for this 11-inch tasteless Pizza.  But I suppose it is the strip.  

I was pretty irritated by the waiter at one point. When I told him that I wanted a porter or stout.  He pointed to the appropriate section on the menu. There were 5 options.  After looking for 10 seconds, I made a choice.  

""Sorry, we're no longer serving that one""

Another 10 seconds of deliberation. A choice is made. 

""Sorry, we're out of that one too""

Yo, waiter.  I've made it clear that I want a porter or stout. And now I've tried to order 40% of your options and at least 40% of what your menu supposedly offers is not available. Instead of allowing us to waste our time, maybe let me know that 2 or 3 of the 5 beers that I'm selecting from aren't available.  Would be really helpful.  Seems like a no brainer.  Can you imagine if 4 beers was unavailable and I just proceed to name all 5 beers before getting to the 1 available choice?  No.  How dumb is that?  So irritating.  Let people in the future know what 3 are available please.  Thank you. 

Place is called Flour and Barley.  Should be Flour and Barely.  As in they ""barely"" have any dark beers to choose from.  Or there is ""barely"" any flavor in the food.  Or this place barely gets 3-stars.

I shouldn't be so harsh. Waiter was good for the most part and Management was nice too.  Just tilted from the recent recollection of the attempted beer order.  Appetizers were pretty good.  Pizza wasn't great, but not atrocious.  Bad...idk, it's pushing it.  Somewhere between average and not quite bad.  We'll just call the place 2.75-stars and round up.",2

Having lived in the area I knew my way around Las Sendas but had never eaten at The Patio - so I gave the restaurant a call while sitting in my car outside of Bogey's to ask for directions, my specific questions was, ""Where are you in relation to Bogey's?"". The sweet girl on the phone said she couldn't help me with that and she would need to get me a manager. The manager hopped on and I repeated my question - she told me they were right behind Bogey's, I just needed to walk down the path and I would see their door. (Your hostess should really have been able to answer that question...) Anyway, we arrived for our reservations at 5:30 and were quickly seated at a dirty table (when there were multiple, clean, set tables around us) and I asked if she could wipe the table down. The sweet girl (same one on the phone) said she would need to check if that was OK. Someone must have told her we could just sit at a clean table so we were settled in and ready to order. Our waiter arrived promptly and let us know we had 10 minutes left for happy hour (even though the menu and website stated it was supposed to go on for another hour) so we quickly ordered our drinks and munchies and said we would look at the menu to order our entrees. 45 minutes later we were finally able to flag our waiter down to place our meal order. :/  While we were eating we watched other tables around us receive bread/butter/have cloth napkins placed on their laps....basically receive the kind of service we expected from Las Sendas Patio. In the end, our server accidentally put in a drink order twice (so we received an extra cocktail but couldn't drink it since we were all driving), put the wrong cut of meat in for one of our dinners, and we had to flag our server down for spoons, for the check, and finally I just held the check/credit card over my head until a bus boy picked it up and brought it to him.

Moe's has burritos, quesadillas, and taco salads, as well as bowls which can be created to your preference. I typically go with the bowl as it tends to be the healthiest and most filling.  Unfortunately, Moe's transitioned from free guac to now charging for guac.

I have noticed that the last few times I have been to Moe's they have started skimping on the chips. Chips are free so that's understandable. Overall, Moe's is a solid option for lunch but there is nothing unique about it. I have no real complaints: the food is always fresh and has good flavor.

I ate at Bouchon in Napa years ago and was excited to see the location in Vegas. We had friends in from Mexico City and they had not experienced a Thomas Keller restaurant so I decided to take them to there. What a mistake. It took 15mins for our server, James, to even acknowledge we were there. He was aloof and condescending and not pleasant in the least. I get it, you're a waiter at Bouchon, oh my! We ordered and hoped for the best. It was only downhill from there. The appetizers were completely average, I mean just blah. Everything was devoid of flavor. You know you're in trouble when the best thing on the table is the bread and butter. Like the title says, we could have been at any formula food eatery. Yet, we held out hope. 2 Steak Bouchon arrive looking fabulous, and cooked to a perfect medium rare. I was excited to see this whole thing turn around, it didn't. While cooked perfectly, the steak had no seasoning and was anything but tender. Accompanying the steak was a Bearnaise sauce that was watery butter with some tarragon thrown in, just awful. One of my guests ordered the Gnudi dumplings, quite possibly the greatest travesty ever perpetrated on a truffle in the history of cuisine. Completely flavorless, not even the truffles could save these balls of nothingness. When the waiter eventually graced us with his presence I commented that the dumplings were disappointing and lacking in flavor, he rolled his eyes and said, ""Gnudi means naked"". Thanks for the Italian lesson, however, Gnudi does not mean ""tasteless, texture-less, horrific ball of goo"". Double espressos all around so we can the hell out of Dodge. What arrived was tepid brown water, no crema, no flavor. As if they got all 6 from the same puck. I was so embarrassed that I suggested Bouchon to my friends; that I introduced first-timers to one of the greatest American chefs and what we got was a bad Bennigan's experience. Another great sells out. Shame on you.",2

I am not a fish taco type of person, so that is somewhat important to my review. But, I am a food person, and flavors are a big part of what makes me decide if I LOVE something. I had two tacos, a steak taco, and a salmon taco. The salmon taco had a sauce that used horseradish as the main flavor, likely a good match for seafood. This taste, however, turns me off in general, making the taco get overpowered. The steak tacos was good, the steak a bit chewier than I would like, especially after the Carne Asada Fries from Sabor next door.

A friend and I decided to dine at the bar seating area for the soup/salad/breadsticks special for a late lunch, but what should have been a simple routine order turned into a train wreck that evolved into the last time I eat at OG. 

They had employees (including what appeared to be a manager) wandering aimlessly like malfunctioning roomba vacuums, several tables were left un-bussed for almost an hour, and a complete lack of service even at the basic level left us mind boggled. We watched a couple looking around, waiting for a server, but they did what we should have and walked out after several minutes. Despite knowing what we wanted before we arrived, our order wasn't taken until over a half hour after walking through the door. The salad was under dressed, the breadsticks salty, the soup was fine although the lack of service left a poor taste in our mouths throughout the entire meal. Our server disappeared more often than David Copperfield so locating someone to get a check took several minutes after finishing. The manager finally came over and presented the check but then the train derailed. We immediately put two cards down to pay and waited, and waited, and waited. We looked around, made comments, contemplated just leaving. Nobody wanted to take our money. Finally, 15 minutes later our server reappeared from her disappearing act to run our cards we requested to be split. Obviously too difficult of a task as the entire bill was charged to one card.

In order to have the ultimate experience we ordered the Meat and More Meat stuffed pizza.  The menu said expect a 35 - 45 minute wait so no surprises.  After 60 minutes our pizza arrived and it was delicious.   I enjoyed a cold slice the next day and it didn't disappoint.   

Our server was slow to arrive, kept falling behind on refreshing our drinks and was slow to bring our bill.

15071,1,1548201600000,"This review is for all the idiots that can't think through that natural gas is different than electricity, telephone or water.  You can't just flip a switch and turn on gas.  It is flammable, explosive and possibly dangerous.  So what does a company like Southwest Gas do, they come to your house and verify your gas lines in your house, which are your responsibility so they are doing you a service, are leak free before they turn on your gas.  They then come inside and make sure each appliance is working safely (last time I checked the water or electric company don't care if you have issues inside your house).  Since they are about safety, they must field emergency calls about possible gas leaks all day that can also affect having short appointment windows.  

All this takes time, thus why they might not have a technician to turn it on that day and you must plan ahead, but I wouldn't want anyone to take responsibility themselves and blame the utility.  I'm sure you can also call your local utility commission and tell them you would like to pay higher gas bills each month to ensure that Southwest Gas has technicians sitting around twiddling their thumbs waiting for a call to turn someone on. 
That way you can take no responsibility for your actions and not plan.  Somehow I have moved multiple times around the country and find every gas company about the same, but people are just too self centered to think it through.

Southwest Gas does a good job getting you service set up and going as long as you plan ahead.  Also they are right there if you ever think there is a gas leak.",1

It took one year and a half to fine the owners...... What other places the population of Montreal is visiting without suspecting there are similar problems.",2
15101,3,1548806400000,"A very disappointing experience. I had visited the CC at Sky Harbor, and despite my reservations about the food, I decided to try the one in Old Town Scottsdale. It was 6:30 on a Sunday evening, and quite quiet, only three other tables had been filled. The greeting was cordial, but nothing more. I took the scallops on a squash base with rice, my wife took the carpaccio. Service was quick enough but that's where it went downhill. The scallops, although cooked correctly, contrasted way too sharply with the cranberry sauce on top of them. The squash was over pureed, making it too soft and the textures didn't match up, it was also under seasoned and very bland. My wife's carpaccio was served on a warm place with over vinegared pickles, making for a very mis matched menu. We also ordered a side of steak fries, which turned out to be oven cooked jacket potatoes. My beer was warm, and generally unpalatable. The waitress poured water into my club soda, despite the bottle being right next to the glass.  To top it all my wife then found a hair on her plate. By this time we had had enough. For all of the above we were then charged $70, which for the quality of service and food, was about $50 overpriced. I have tried CC twice, and that will be the last time. Its a restaurant trying to be something that it isn't, and fails quite badly. The menu is an odd collection of food that doesn't really work together, and definitely needs an overhaul.",1
15103,3,1546819200000,"We were glad to visit this restaurant.  Although living in Southern California, we seldom go to Las Vegas.  The last time we were in LV, it was 2009 and this restaurant was not here, I believe.

Wow, we like it a lot that we went twice during the 3 days we were in LV.  Dishes were so good.  They have a 'BALANCED' taste.  The sweet is not too sweet, the salty taste is not too salty, and the sour taste is not too sour.  I don't know how to describe it but they taste well balanced.

The sign of good food is that you can't stop eating.  That's how it was with my experience.  Every bite was followed by another bite since I wanted more and more.  We finished all of our lunch order dishes. For us the best one was the Crispy Oyster Mushroom with Lemongrass sauce.  Because of this dish, my husband wanted to go back to the restaurant instead of trying other vegan places in LV.  I did try bravely to have the seaweed stems.  Surprisingly, they were good.  The Crispy Eggplants and Crispy Beef dishes were also delicious but we prefer the Crispy Oyster Mushrooms dish.

The price was also so reasonable for lunch specials.  The service was attentive and friendly.  I wish that I can try more dishes before we left but we only have one stomach and only a few chances to dine here.

We will come back to this place again when we have a chance in the future.  I hope that this place will continue and be successful.",1
15111,1,1548028800000,"My boy Slicc put me on to this place.  They got a lunch special that's a double cheeseburger with all the toppings and fries for $5.  That's a clutch price for lunch Id say.  If you eat inside its set up like a classic diner with coca cola memorabilia everywhere.

Yet another reason to visit Warrington Ave.  I give this place 5 years till its BOOMIN again.",2
15112,1,1548547200000,I love this place quite hole in the wall bar. They don't put up with potty mouths and will ask you to leave. Which is nice when you don't want to listen to all that swearing. And on Friday they have the best fish sandwich in the world. Huge 2 pieces of fish on a bun and it's not that bs. Mc donalds squished fish patty on a bun. No real huge two pieces that is amazing and filling.,3
15113,2,1546819200000,"Solid bar food, darts and shuffle board. If they had some more big screens it would be a 4 star.",2
15113,3,1548633600000,"Its been a couple of months since we went.  Been checking this place our for quite some time, was always on a wait so thought we were really missing something.  Not really, the food was ok, the service was ok, the patty was nice, quiet and romantic.  Glad we did not sit inside, loud and filled with lots of families, I say this cause it was on date night...",3
15118,3,1548633600000,"I've only sat in the restaurant once (nothing too special) BUT I LOVEEEE the takeout counter next door. Best value! Delicious!!!! Well worth the line up when its busy. This used to be my go-to lunch place for work (until my work relocated).

If you're planning to pick up some lunch during weekdays, call in ahead so you can avoid lining up!

My favourite is the lamb pita sandwich :)",3
15125,2,1548460800000,"All I can say is ""Yum Yum in my Tum"". everything is made from scratch !!! This place puts a tweak on all of their items . I had the best caramelized banana waffle , if you are allergic to nuts tell them to make yours without the walnuts. So,my AZ peeps ,wake up and go for the drive ... it won't disappoint! As always when you go let me know and enjoy",2

15137,1,1548288000000,The worst burger joint in Charlotte. The line wasn't that bad and that's the only reason I didn't give it 1 star. The food  was just okay. I could have went to McDonalds or better yet just cook a burger at home. The employees are in there talking about each other and one employee start d arguing with a guest. The young lady wen through the lobby with trash while this family was eating and was very rude to this young man and his family. I wished I had gotten her name it wasn't even me but it was very rude. This same young lady was talking about the manager and other people in the restaurant... customer service at its worst.,2
15148,1,1546560000000,"Great experience - very clean, staff is friendly and Lee is awesome! He did an amazing job on my nails - they're perfect! I've never had to wait here.",2
15155,1,1547251200000,"Since the closing of B-Dubs next door, this has become more of a favorite hang out! When I was a kid and we'd come to town on vacation (and I had a huge crush on Thunder Dan), we'd always go to the downtown location.  Now that I live in the West Valley and Majerle's is a 5 minute drive...I'm there often!

As mentioned in a few other reviews, the Gorilla Wings live up to their name! They're huge in size and in flavor.  The Buffalo Shrimp appetizer is freakin' phenomenal as well! You can get any of their sauces on the shrimp, so you can try something different each time.  Their fries are awesome, crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  

As for entrees, they have a killer Ruben sandwich and their pastas are really good as well.  

A full bar and wall to wall tv's makes this a great place to catch a game any night of the week.  

I'm still waiting to catch a glimpse of Thunder Dan himself, and hopefully this time I won't make a food out of myself and completely freeze up like the one time I met him! ;-)",2
15156,2,1547769600000,"Price 3/5 - $14 for desert + tea

Service 4/5 - Corporate smile on the face. 

Food 3/5 - Nothing different or outstanding. Regular burgers, regular salads

Nothing special or different about this place. Another fast food corporation franchise.

Will NOT be back!",2
15159,1,1546560000000,Really enjoyed the drinks and live music singing Frank Sinatra style. A nice break from all the clubbing for a relaxing and fun time listening and some calm dancing at the east side lounge. Too bad we came towards the end - wish I knew about it before,2

15164,2,1546819200000,"Nice little place with shaded sidewalk and indoor tables. Seemed like a local place, not one specifically designed to pull in Hoover Dam tourist trade. 

I ordered Jacks burger and it was perfectly cooked to my request. French fries were great. All other members of my party reported being very happy with their orders. 

Highly recommended.",2
15166,1,1548115200000,"I have so many mixed feelings about this Wally. The store is clean and the isles are wide. The layout is nice. Having the frozen food in the front actually makes sense. You don't have to pay for makeup, face wash, and lotion at a designated makeup register. It is definitely convenient being next to Sams. You can park in the middle and split the difference. Here's what gets me here. I can't stand the Direct TV people hassling you all the way down the isle in front of the tvs. It's so bad that I will go out of my way to avoid this area. I also don't like their register lines. The two register in each line gets things confused very easily. It's hard to see how long the lines actually are, and then people try to snake into the front register. It's just a mess. I did notice they have a free online grocery pickup. The area is right outside the grocery area, near Sams.",2

15175,1,1546732800000,"My wife and I took our daughter to Mercedes-Benz in Chandler to look at Smart Cars. We were greeted warmly by Gavin Hill (Sales Manager) who introduced us to a very friendly Arnold Lim (Sales & Leasing Consultant). Arnold spent several hours explaining the Smart Car's benefits. This process took significant time because of our daughter's nervousness with her first car lease. Arnold was incredibly helpful and patient and allowed us time to have many private conversations with our daughter to work through her fears. Ultimately, Arnold, with Gavin's support, helped our daughter lease a Smart Car. The entire experience was a joy and the lease our daughter signed was amazing! While still nervous over her first-time financial commitment, she was ecstatic and loves her new car.
My wife and I were so impressed with the outstanding customer service and the friendly, low pressure sales process, that we returned to the dealership the next day and leased a new Mercedes 300. Again, the entire experience was a pleasure. Arnold patiently showed us several options and then helped us make the best decision. He was fantastic! Gavin worked to ensure we got the best lease possible. Finally, Vicki Kovalcik (Financial Services Consultant) slowly and professionally walked us through the details of the lease making sure we understood everything and had all our questions answered. Signing the lease was easy with such an outgoing finance specialist there to help.
Overall, dealing with the team at Mercedes-Benz of Chandler was THE BEST EXPERIENCE we've ever had in shopping for a new car. Plus, the new car itself is absolutely wonderful! We plan to lease every car we need in the future from our new Mercedes ""family"". Thank you to everyone at Mercedes-Benz of Chandler.",2
15175,2,1547251200000,Very trendy.  Good food.  Served very quickly.  Almost too quickly.  Very loud.  Very hip.  Definitely recommend reservations.,3
15185,1,1546819200000,"I had the chicken and waffles last fall, or was it summer?, at the street fair they had for The West Side Market.  It was so good I couldn't wait to go and get a real dinner.

I did end up waiting and my son and I went tonight,  We were greeted and seated nicely and quickly. Our first question was could we get the sweet potato ravioli with out jalapenos , which our server told us no, it's already in the mixture.  Ok, sensible answer, but we won't be trying them.  Next, my son wanted both soups, so we asked if he could get 1/2 serving of each.  Simple request, I thought.  The server immediately responded with, ""NO!  We don't do that.""  Really?  Why not?  She went to the back to ask and came back and again told us no, claiming that the soup was made to order.  REALLY??   Soup is made to order but entrees aren't.  Rather ridiculous. (So the duck in the gumbo was slow cooked, apparently in ten minutes??) At this point, I'm irritated and would have preferred to leave and go elsewhere.

We stayed.  We both got chicken and waffles, which were good but for $16 I would like both pieces of chicken to be white meat, or at least given the option.  For $16 you get 1/2 a waffle, 1 piece of white meat, a fatty piece of dark meat and a tablespoon of syrup.  

They had a nice selection of soda pop and they all come with a nice price of $3.50 each.  At least we saved money on the tip.  

We went.  We ate.  I seriously doubt if I'll go back.",3
15193,2,1546387200000,Shrimp and broccoli is always my go to lunch. Good Chinese food here and lunch is till 3 pm and cost 4.99 for lunch specials. I've also had their General Tso chicken and sesame chicken which was pretty good. Small restaurant with just a few tables.,3

I really like Dr Spotts. She does her best to put me at ease and ensure me that I am doing just fine. A few years back I got a lump in my chest due to falling really hard. I thought I had cancer possibly. But I later found out from Dr Spotts that it was trauma. 

I go I get my yearly check up and I trust her professional opinion, she has been doing this longer than I have been alive and I respect her and am grateful to her for being such a wonderful doctor. I can't say i trust every doctor I meet but I do this woman. 

She is very knowledgeable and I am glad she is my doctor! Thank you!",2
15200,1,1546560000000,"Food is amazing. I would go there everyday if it were possible. Never gets old. Must visit if in town. Normally there is a long line, and it can take some time to get a table; but believe me, it is well worth it.",2
15202,2,1548806400000,"Waited 30 minutes for a smoothie. The staff looked overwhelmed and under trained. They had 8 people waiting for drinks and 7 people waiting to order, yet one of the employees thought it was the time to take out the trash. Very poorly run location.",2
15209,3,1548892800000,What a wonderful surprise!! Everything was perfect!! You can really tell that the kitchen has an amazing chef who is picky and only serves quality foods! To top it off our waitress Alex was AMAZING! She really made our experience top notch!,2
15212,2,1548633600000,"Nestled along many fine dining restaurants, including Biff's Bistro, O&B, and Houston Steakhouse, Fran's makes its mark by offering a quick and cheaper alternative in the district. 

From several visits, I have mixed feelings on coming back here again.
The staff are friendly. Though service can be quite slow, whether if the restaurant is busy or not. It took several attempts just to wave my waitress down to refill our water. It was not until the bill came did she bring a pitcher of water.

Fran's is best known for their breakfast and diner type food items, though there is nothing spectacular. 

Fran's Fish & Chips - Poorly executed. It was thin and tough to eat. It seemed over deep-fried as the fish appeared dark brown, more than what it should look like - golden brown. Coleslaw wasn't any better.

Fran's Philly Beef Sandwich - Cooked medium rare. This was a decent sandwich, but I had better.

Fran's Onion Soup - Melted cheese, large  garlic croutons, beefy broth and sweet onion. It was a nice starter on a cold night. Not bad, not great.

Note: Don't be fooled with food items that start with the word Fran's -. It doesn't necessarily mean it's any better than the ones you've had.",2

Now if we got a $20 credit for food or drinks, that would be different.  There's too many places in town to watch the game and with better giveaways!  We were there last week and had a great time, food was good and people were great.  But $20 to get in???  It's not even the money, it's the principle of it.",2

15216,3,1546473600000,"I came with my parents, hubby and 3 kids (6 and under). Most $$$$ restaurants are not fans of kids because well kids, they can be loud, annoying and so many other things. As they called us for our table they looked at my group and they were second guessing letting us in. They asked that if my baby cried that I was to remove myself from the restaurant. Duh!! I don't want people looking at me with a crying baby. It was just sad that they needed to tell me and sad someone wouldn't take responsibility for their children. 

Other then that, had a wonderful meal with no crying baby or loud, annoying children because if they act up - NO DESSERT! Lol!

Food: Wonderful and delicious
Between us all; Chicken, Filet Mignon, Salmon,  Hubby ordered something seafood, kids split Mac n Cheese and my chicken

15226,1,1547596800000,"Yes, I'm a local business mark so let me preface this review with that. The only reason this particular location isn't getting five stars is because it is in an absolutely terrible location. Sandwiched between a Goodwill and an automotive title switcher you are bound to get some horrible smelling/acting customers.

Ignore these oddities and you'll find yourself faced with a giant powder keg of nostalgia waiting to blow up in your face. Nintendo 64, Super Nintendo, Sega Saturn, Laser Disc, Beta Max, Old Action figures, CDs, Ancient Magazines, and all the books you can possibly imagine. 

There also exists a charming cafe where you can relax and read said books, play with said action figures, and peruse issues of 'Wired' from 1994. A really great place to take your children as well...provided they act like civilized animals and not just wild ones.",2
15234,3,1547596800000,Excellent food and ambience. I had the BBQ mahi tacos. The crab dip should be called crack dip as we couldn't stop eating it--it was so delicious! Great margaritas! Service was excellent.,2

We set a time for him to come back to clean the carpets and when I arrived at the appointed time, he was there waiting on me!

15243,3,1547769600000,"This is actually a 4.5...My hubs suggested this, when we both woke up hungry on Saturday morning and living close seemed like a good option. I've heard of this place before, but never been. We got there at a good time, as there was no line to order food, that quickly changed. 

It's relatively small in there, very diner style, so we chose to take ours to go and eat at home. The cashier was wonderful I asked if I could get fruit instead of toast and hashbrowns, and they swapped it free of charge. 

They were very good in their packaging to ensure that none of my food touched my husbands so I wouldn't have to ingest gluten. Breaky was good, fruit was actually fresh, not canned. Steve had two sausage minis and always raves how good they are. 

I'm sure we will be back.",2

15256,1,1546646400000,"We had a double date for Restaurant Week...2 of us tried the RW menu and the other 2 ordered from the standard menu. We thought this would be a good way to try multiple dishes.

PROS
Pig face dumplings! Juicy, crispy on the bottom and the table was a fan of the spicy kimchi.
The Kobe app - very tasty with the mushrooms, super buttery protein and cooked just right.
My friend liked her forbidden rice dish, she didn't get any protein with it just veggies, she esp liked the bok choy
I ordered the crispy duck, delish rice cake and pineapple puree as the sauce, veggies were just how I liked that all charred but still crunchy

CONS
I ordered a glass of the Tempranillo, server came back and gave me other options. 
Banana fritters were not really fritters, they were more donut holes/beignet style, it could have been cooked a little more, too gooey for me
Skimped on sauces in the dishes

15279,2,1548201600000,"Went on a mini brewery crawl this weekend stopping at Triple C, Heist, Birdsong, and finishing with dinner at Growlers Pourhouse. Started with Triple C, now for the next stop in our evening out... Charlotte's newest brewpub; Heist Brewery.

Situated in the cultural hub of NoDa, Heist occupies the old Highland Mill building. The place is beautiful... just the right mix of new and old. You get some very nice woodwork and stonework adorning the walls, while at the same time preserving the history of the space. When you walk in there is an open space with several tables and a bar, as you pass through into the next area you pass a kitchen area with a custom wood burning pizza oven that is open to the rest of the space so that the aroma of pizza baking fills the whole building. Once you stop gawking at the pizza oven you will notice a wall full of windows showcasing the brewhouse, and another bar area. Really, in addition to being eye catching and well laid out the place is huge, there is upstairs seating and yet a third bar type area with seats and tap handles. I could hang out here all day

The service is decent, the waiter we had was attentive and polite. He tried to be helpful, and knew a fair amount about the menu, but very little about the beer. 

Now, on to the menu... I feel like this place has fallen victim to ""celebrity chef syndrome"". To many dishes that try to be just a bit too clever. Too little food for too high a price.  Lobster Bisque Test Tubes, BBQ Braised Pork Belly Corn Dogs, Asian Shrimp with Lemon Wasabi Cotton Candy?, Chicken and Waffles... C'mon man!! The burgers, and flat breads don't look too bad, but lets stop trying so hard to be the next food network star.

Now on to the main attraction... The beer. Unfortunately I am underwhelmed by the beer. Eleven house made beers on tap and all of the mediocre at best. How about we cut the beer menu down to a manageable four or five offerings and make the shine!! I don't need ten or eleven beers from a new start up brewery, I need two or three beers that blow my hair back (back when I had hair). We ordered two samplers so that we could try all of the beers, I thought the oatmeal stout was the best beer of the bunch. I would go on to describe the rest of them but I forgot about them even as I was drinking them. Now, don't get me wrong. None of the beers were deeply flawed, just uninspired. While none of them knocked my socks off, none of them were offensive or had bad off flavors either, just boring. I'm not looking for crazy, extreme beers, just good beers done well.

I really wanted to like this place. I was pulling for them to be the next great Charlotte area brewery... and they still could be, but there is work to be done.

All in all I am ready for the next place, on to Birdsong...",2

The fries were pretty good, and Pete's is generous with them. But the fish? I've had frozen fish sticks that tasted better than that stuff. Yes, I tried the shrimp too. Those weren't much better. So, no.

Wait, their red sauce was kind of good. I do agree with people about that. But, what's the point of good sauce on rubbish food? So, still, no.

I went for dinner on a Monday night; the restaurant was fairly empty when I arrived, but seemed to pick up towards the end of my meal.

I had the Pho #1 Rare Eye Round ($10) and wasn't very impressed.  While the beef and noodles were delicious, the broth itself was lacking.  When the pho arrived, I could smell the delicious flavors associated with pho like star anise and clove.  However, I was unable to taste any of those flavors.  I also had the Tom Kha soup with tofu ($5), and it was honestly some of the best Tom Kha I've ever had!  It was super flavorful and packed with delicious veggies and well-prepared tofu.

Anyways, once again my party of 5 walked in and no one to be found at the hostess station so we stood and looked around for someone finally about 5 mins later the hostess comes from the back in the meantime no else has bothered to ask if we needed help. She does not greet us at all, I tell her party of 5 she reaches down to grab menus and then starts counting my party and says how many 5? Yeah, I thought I already established that. We finally get seated and after a while our waiter comes over and gets drink orders which take a pretty long time considering it's a Weds evening and they are hardly busy at all. When he comes back doesn't bother asking if we have questions, mentions any specials, or ask if we want appetizers so we order our food 3 of my party have special instructions like no onions. A very long time later our food arrives a different waitress drops it off asked if we need anything we tell her yes, drink refills and sides of ranch she ok I get those for you. Well we never saw her again and we also noticed none of our special instructions have been taken care of. So everyone that didn't want onions got them. In the meantime our waiter asks if everything is ok we tell him well we told the other waitress what we needed more drinks and ranch he says ok. We are still waiting assuming one of the two will bring our requests. Didn't happen.  So after a good while half of my party is half way done with their food he sees me looking around and says do you need something. I said yeah all the stuff we asked for like 20 mins ago!!!!!!  So he take his sweet time to bring all our refills and sides of ranch. At this point we are almost done with our food and I just want to get out of here asap. The whole time the manager is of course no where to be found and the hostess leaves her post constantly so I see why we had the 1st problem, I could see from where I sat the same problem with multiple parties they walk in look around and no one is there to greet their customers. Very disappointing!!!!!",2

The food is still delicious and make sure your appetite didn't go on vacation before you come here. In fact, do a two mile (or more) charity walk like we did before you dine.

Our party of four arrived around 10:40 on a late Saturday morning to a restaurant at capacity and on a wait, we were seated before 10:45, and we were walking out the door at 11:25. We sat in a booth in the bar area and Yvette took great care of us. Although she was busy, she was quite pleasant, informative, and efficient. From our experience on this visit, we did not have any service issues that have been described about the restaurant in its opening months.

I had the gigantic pumpkin flapjack which was light, fluffy, and the pumpkin flavor was tasty but not overpowering. This was a good start to many other pumpkin flavors I'll be experiencing this fall. Also ordered were the barbecue chicken sandwich with fries, the Warsaw hash, and the basic. Everyone was hungry and finished within 15 minutes with every single plate being clean. We cashed out and left happy, full, and satisfied knowing that we didn't spend the majority of our morning hungry and waiting.

The restaurant still kind of reminded me of the Tony Roma's that was there previously, but there is plenty of seating and if the service is capable, should be able to handle large volume of customers. Although pretty classic comfort/farm food, the extra ""twists"" and large portions makes this place unique and will have us coming back for more.",2

We chose this place because we figured they had a good mix of American food at reasonable prices. We also figured they had a lunch menu and even more reasonable prices. They do have a lunch menu, but it was not very impressive. I do wish there were more options on the lunch menu, but if you found something it was a pretty good deal where you could choose half a sandwich, soup, or salad for $5.99. The rest of the prices are pretty fair too though.

I tried the Parmesan garlic wings, which were pretty good, and tried some beer-battered fries, which were also good. I heard good things about the cod fish sandwich and the tacos.

It was a good, decently priced lunch option that we were able to do quickly.",2

Hunkar begendi on the specials menu - one of my favorites!  Quite well made.

I was already hyped about going here during EZ-P and J-Ho's birthday celebration weekend (aka the EZ-Ho weekend).  I was looking for any crack in the hull to sink Mesa Grill's ship but I simply couldn't find one.

Scurrying through the dining area, I peered through the big kitchen windows to see if Flay was in the house (and he wasn't).  I loved that the place was relatively casual, and not pretentious.  Decor was simple, nothing to really distract you away from your meal.  The wait staff was attentive, informed, friendly, and even precognitive a couple times!

Chimay is on the beer list, causing my eyes to well up in sheer joy.  We shared the shrimp tamale signature dish, which was impossibly bold and delicate at the same time.  My lamb porterhouse chops with chimichurri sauce were great, nicely medium rare, seasoned well.  The sauce was well executed though I must say the chops didn't taste as good after I tried EZ-P's signature pork dish which was extraterrestrial far as flavors go.  I will be back and I will have that dish then.  Ehh, what the hell, you had me at Chimay...

I decided to go for the mid tier wash that cost extra just to have the dash wiped down (remember that part). I see my car pull out and begin to get dried, so I'm thinking these guys must work fast. About 10 minutes later I get called over and shown my truck which didn't look to clean at all. They explained that waters spots can't be removed from a basic wash and needed a special acid wash that is 50.oo a panel so in total about 300 for what I needed. I decided not to get that wash. The first thing I noticed is armor all or w.e they use to clean the interior dripping on my steering wheel and politely asked if I could get that wiped down. I sat in my truck and noticed my carpets were slippery and the dash has visible dirt close towards the windshield, which is exactly what I fucking paid NOT to have. Looking at my center console there was more dirt/dust all over my display screen and some parts where wiped town and had grease dripping down. I wiped it as I drove off, and no tip was given because I noticed all this in a few seconds. I decided to get some microfiber towels from auto zone to finished the mediocre job that was done inside.

 As I start wiping the front down I also noticed small pieces of trash, lint, small stuff that should've been picked up by a vacuum and grease all over my damn floor matts. Then looking at the doors there was dirt still all along the edges of the doors and door jams visibly dirty. I look in my back seat and remembered I had a plastic mat in the back and seen that it wasn't moved. Neither were my jackets I had back there, and seats weren't touched.
 Whenever I've gone to any other car washes they gently move the stuff clean and put it back. These fucks didn't move anything in the back, didn't get the trash that was on the floor, doors were caked with grease and had to be wiped down and had. 
. Moving on to the outside of the car, there was excessive amount of tire shine that leaked onto the tread of my tires. The wheels weren't even wiped down. Now again I understand the water spots don't come off of the wheels either but I used my finger to wipe shit off, I see where one wheel got started then left alone so I know he attempted. Moving to the front of the car that wasn't touched. There was bug splats on it and i found some bird shit, headlights halfass wiped down.

This place is a fucking joke. 

To the managers of this place, train your people how to correctly wash damn car/truck. I've had my son do a better job than that. I'd rather wait 45 minutes to get a proper wash then to get out in 15 minutes and finish your employees fucking job when I get home.",2

Came in during happy hour and had a spicy salmon roll, seaweed salad, soft shell crab and shumai. The roll was made out of rice that was overcooked and the pieces all fell apart. Seaweed salad and shumai were nothing special. The soft shell crab was a tiny piece of crab for $6. It was the best thing I had among everything I ordered, but I wish they added a little more breading. Over all, this place just isn't for me. Service wasn't great, my water was never refilled and I felt like I was bothering my server.

I have to say, I'm impressed. Coming from the San Francisco, a town that prides itself on good food, fresh fish, and inventive sushi, I didn't have super high hopes about sushi in Ohio. Our family in the area loves sushi, so they picked what they thought was the best place around, and took us to Big Eye. I thought that the menu was very creative and varied, the fish was fresh, and the portions were large for a sushi place. It was priced slightly less than the sushi places I'm used to, and you really get your money's worth.

I really enjoyed the Damon roll (yellowtail, scallion and cream cheese) and the Yummy and Kiss rolls. My husband had sashimi that was a thick cut and very good.

The outside patio is my favorite place to lounge with a drink. This past Saturday night when we were there with friends, the fireplace was on which gave a cozy vibe as we relaxed on the oversize beds with our drinks. I have never had a problem going to the inside bar and getting drinks...in fact, service has always been quick for me and the bartenders are really friendly. Rum and cokes cost about $9 and beers are $6. So if you are out for a night of drinking, you can expect to drop a pretty penny. If you arrive before 10 pm (I think), there is no cover. Red Bar isn't a place I could go every weekend, but every once in a while it's a nice destination.

My one negative about Red Bar is that the bathrooms are outside the lounge in the hotel. If you have to go to the bathroom, you need to get a hand stamp so you can get back in. Normally this is something I could probably overlook, but this past Saturday, we arrived before anyone was even checking IDs at the door, so we walked right in. I opened a tab at the bar and was required to leave my ID with my debit card. When I tried to leave to go to the bathroom and asked for a handstamp, I was told I had to show them my ID. I explained I arrived before they started IDing at the door and that my license was currently at the bar with my tab. They wouldn't give me a hand stamp!!!! So I was stuck not going to the bathroom the whole evening. It didn't ruin my evening but left a slightly bad taste in my mouth.

Despite that, I'll go back to Red Bar. You can't beat the upscale relaxed atmosphere and the people watching that abounds!",3
15471,2,1547078400000,"Overall, my bike ride along this trail was pleasant and I am definitely planning to do it again. I'm a leisurely biker, and for me this trial was well marked, popular among other cyclists, and not very busy as far as cars go. There's also a few rest areas in parks a little off the trail. I stopped in Winnequah park to get water and use the restroom, and it was decent. The views and neighborhoods that are along this trail are gorgeous during the summer. 

The main reason it lost a star was this detour on the east side of the lake at Walter road. Apparently, the city of Monona doesn't allow bikes on the sidewalk, so for part of the trail you have to detour through a neighborhood. The detour involves many turns weaving around blocks. If you don't mind riding on the side of a busy street for about 5 minutes, I would recommend ignoring the detour signs and just staying on the original road until you meet up with the trail again. A bike lane is marked after about 5 minutes of riding, so you don't have to ride with traffic very far.",1

15523,3,1546992000000,"First off I want to say, don't go here with large group. Theres a lot of other great places to eat in the city. I planned a surprise birthday party here for my boyfriend. But the problems began weeks before our reservations. After making the reservation over the phone, I get an email containing a ""contract"". You have to fill it out and put down a credit card number when you have a party of 12+. I fill it out and email it back. I get no reply or phone call to tell me if they received it. I called constantly for 3 days, leaving a bunch of voicemails. Finally someone decided to pick up on the third day. They tell me they have to ask the manager but he was in a meeting. Lovely, more time waiting. Of course they don't bother calling back, so I call the next day and the lady tells me she has to ask the manager. I told her I wasn't getting off the phone just to play telephone tag, she needed to either put him on the phone or ask him herself right away. So I'm assuming she spoke to him and I had to resend the contract to his email address. Thanks for the heads up; it would've been nice if it said that in the contract. So I emailed it to him. Then they tell you you have to call the day before to confirm the number of people attending because if more then one person doesn't show up and are included in that final number, you have to pay for them anyways. Stupidest rule ive ever heard of. So if more then one person bails on you last minute, you're stuck paying for them. So I call the day before, of course no one answers so I left a message. But since it's clear they don't check their messages, I called a few hours later and actually got someone on the phone. I told her I was confirming the number of guests for my party and she asks ""is it still 20?"" (which was the original number when I made the reservations weeks ago) I told her no it changed to 13, I had already called earlier and left a message. Finally the day comes, and it only got worse. Me and a few of the guests arrived at 7:10, a bit before our reservations for 7:30. They tell me my table for 12 is ready. Yeah, I called and confirmed 13 but clearly they don't listen. Anyways, we sit down and wait for the remaining guests. In a matter of half an hour, 4 different people came up to tell me that we better hurry up because we only have the table till 9:30. A heads up would've been nice but clearly they don't believe in courtesy. 3 minutes before the birthday boy walks in the door, the owner comes up and tells me we need to hurry up and eat because we have to leave by 9:30.  They might as well just have shoved us out the door. 

Moral of the story, going with a few people would probably give you the most you can get out of this place, but if you're looking to go with a large group, stay far far away. The food was probably the only good thing about my experience there.",3

15557,3,1546992000000,"This was my first time on a Segway and Steve the tour guide made it really easy to learn.  With his instruction I picked it up in about three minutes.  The vehicle was very stable and easy to operate.  I have always snowboarded and skateboarded and other carving sports so it was natural for me to pick this up so quickly.  I think anyone could pick up the basic operation of a Segway rather quickly. 

After the brief orientation on how to safely operate we were free to test the Seway's ability and limitation's.  What fun this was tearing up the parking lot on a Segway.  Our tour group tooled around until all members of the group arrived.  After that happened we hit the street's of DTLV.  

Segway Steve was informative with sharing the information about his city's history, business, and sometimes unknown facts about Las Vegas.  He made sure to stop at the drive thru wedding chapel and bail bonds places which are two of the top five businesses in Las Vegas.  Ha!,  a little info nugget from Segway Steve that he shared with us while on the tour.  Other places we ventured to were the Arts District, Fremont Street Experience, City Hall and then back home by the Gold and Silver Pawn shop better known for the TV show ""Pawn Stars"".

The Tour with Steve took about an hour.  Our group had so much fun seeing the sights in Las Vegas.  It was such a different perspective than driving in the car and much better than walking around for hours.  We covered several miles in just a moments time.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes a little adventure while in Las Vegas.  Oh yeah the weather was perfect for a Segway ride.",2

15617,1,1547942400000,"This is exactly what Toronto needed. A fantastic vapor shop, with good quality e-juice & a knowledgeable staff. 
I've been vaping for a bit over a year. I started with disposable vapes that you could pick up at the corner store & went on to try Blu (just don't even bother with these forms of vaping). I moved down south to Pensacola, FL, following my mister who is in the Marine Corps. Lots of people Vape on base, which is how we got introduced into the e-juice way of vaping. I moved back to Toronto for a few months & ended up giving up on vaping. There really weren't any good shops (This was May-Aug 2013). The best place at the time was a vendor in Dr. Flea's market called Sassy Joe's. He had tech, but wasn't that knowledgeable or helpful. You also could not try any of his e-juices & had to order ahead of time. Plus his juices didn't have any nicotine to them. 
The past 6 months I've lived in San Diego. There I picked vaping back up & actually stuck to it. Largely because of all the Vapor lounges in Cali. Seriously, tasting all the flavors really makes a difference & having a staff that knows what they are talking about makes the experience a lot less daunting. 

I've been back in Toronto for a bit under a month. I brought some e-juices with me, but ran out of my lighter flavors. Searched yelp & found this gem. 

I finally had a chance to pop by there shop last night. They are located in the front of a cute clothing boutique. This is just a temporary location before they move around the corner & open up a proper Vapor lounge. 
You come in, and they already have all the flavors ready to be tasted. A really nice, uncomplicated approach for e-juice sampling. The ones you like, you place in a stand to the side, which allows you to resample while contemplating which flavors you'll end up buying. It was super smart having each flavor have their own eGo battery attached to it, instead of having to constantly switch out atomizers. 

The e-juices are much thinner than the ones I usually pick up. I actually prefer this. I usually only go for full VG (vegetable glycerin) juices, which provide a good cloud while vaping. Downside is that they can really gunk up your atomizer. E-Cig provides liquids that are a 30/70 mix of VG & PG (Propylene Glycol) which still make great clouds, but don't leave a ruddy mess for me to clean up after a few hours of vaping. Another bonus to these juices is that they actually can include nicotine. I never understood why most Canadian e-juices never include nicotine. Most people that are vaping are transitioning from smoking actual cigarettes. E-cig has juices in FIVE levels of nicotine. 24mg, 18mg, 12mg, 6mg & 0mg. So rad. I personally go for 12mg, since the higher the nicotine, the dryer my throat feels. But it's wonderful that they carry a variety. 
Best thing of all, their juices are really cheap. If you pick up 3, it's 39.99. They only carry 30mL bottles, but at this price, I do not mind at all. That's about 13 bucks a bottle. I've paid 12 USD for a 10mL bottle of lesser quality. Really a great deal. 

They also have a decent amount of hardware for vaping. If you are starting out, I do suggest getting their starter eGo kits & they are priced well. Toronto is still new to the vaping scene, so they don't carry a huge range of atomizers, but the ones they do are of a good quality. I currently use a iClear 30 Dual Coil Clearomizer & a RDA Dual Coil Rebuildable Dripping Atomizer for my stronger e-juices (that would crack plastic atomizers). They did not have replacement wick's for these models, She apologized, but they are just starting out. Toronto doesn't have a demand for such a range of variety yet. 
They DO carry some awesome tank atomizers though. I splurged & picked up a Dual Coil AeroTank (By splurged, I mean spent 30 bucks on this AWESOME atomizer, so totally worth it). It's a glass tank, which allows you to vape those stronger juices which would crack plastic tanks (think cinnamon, root beer, cola). Those stronger flavors are usually my favorites, but it gets mildly annoying having to constantly refilling a drip-tip atomizer while vaping. Having a glass tank let's me vape away for hours without having to carry around the e-juice in my purse. The atomizer also has a ring that allows you to control the airflow into the tank. Never had heard of tanks that did this. It's fun to play around with while vaping. The tank also came with a replacement wick. It's my new favorite atomizer for sure. 

The staff will show you all the parts, and how to use them before you buy them. Such amazing customer service. I cannot wait to watch this place grow. It really is the leader in bringing Vaping to Toronto. I'm planning on stopping by one more time before I leave for San Diego to pick up some more e-juices for myself & to send to my mister who is deployed. I know he'll enjoy this treat in his next care package.",2

We both had the Mesa burger and fries. The burger itself was cooked perfectly. I did not care for the horseradish mustard that it came with, it was overly spicy. The burger was very large and a little awkward to eat. Even cut in half it was hard to bite into it without everything falling out. It was an average burger. I did not care for the fries at all. They had  a spicy little kick to them which I really enjoyed, but the fries were very crispy, not soft at all. I only had a few of them, it was more like eating potato chips.

Our favorite wing flavour is Honey Mustard but I have a soft spot for the hot stuff. Step up and try the Johnny Cash! They're the hottest wings I have ever had but they also have great flavor!

Parking is a bit of a pain at times. The clientele is very eclectic and hard to nail down but this isn't a hipster bar by any means. The interior is cheesy but I kind of like the old-school tiki bar feel of the place to be honest. The bathrooms are kept clean for the most part. The tables aren't sticky and the chairs don't seem to have any holes. There are also a huge projector tv and smaller LCD's around to catch a game and aparently they have live shows but I have yet to catch one. All of the above are positives in my books!

I'm looking forward to try the other items on the menu, but for now I'm completely content with making VooDoo Lounge the regular Sunday wing-night spot. Check it out in the summer when they open up the large windows and let in the gentle breeze from the street.",3

It did take some time for the taco's to get there and that would be my only complaint but they kept bringing those delicious corn taco chips and the corn salsa so that kept me happy. They had a nice beer list also. Always a big plus for me! Then we saw the taco's and got very happy. These things are huge. My GF and I split ours so I got to have BBQ Mahi also.

Poke Guys offer 3 options to pick your bowl: signature bowls with their recipes, poke (just the protein), and build you own bowl. You can choose salad, white rice, or brown rice for carbs. Regular size is good portion for one person and large can feed up to 2 people if they don't eat a lot.

I was planning to build my own but each toppings cost $0.85 so if you're picking more than 3 toppings then it'll be more expensive than their signature bowls.

I order an iced coffee, they made a hot coffee, when they corrected it I then had a warm coffee...worst part is it was the manager who corrected the drink the first time.
I have been to this location before...a few times over the past 6 years and it has always been on the dirty side but the folks working were always nice. Not this time, everyone seemed to be inconvenienced by the customers. Oh well- $3 down the drain along with the warm coffee.",2
15669,3,1546819200000,This is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in town.  The food is authentic and the owners are so hospitable and nice. I love that they've expanded and now offer Chinese/Korean cuisine as well. I recently met up with some friends and we had chajhang myun ( noodles with black bean meat sauce) champhong ( noodles in spicy seafood broth) tang soo yook ( sweet and sour pork or beef .. They recommended pork .. This seems west coast .. East coast it's always done with beef) side of kalbi and everything was delicious! Portions are large and service was good. Cans of soda were only one dollar! I also did a takeout order of combo meat plate and oxtail soup. Wow the oxtail soup was so good I almost cried cause it really reminded me of my mom's. Anyway if you haven't tried them please go you won't be dissapointed :),2
15671,2,1547856000000,"Yes, the burgers are very good, but this place's reputation is just hype. Their prices are WAY too high for a burger joint, and honestly, they aren't much better than McDonalds or Burger King.

Tiny bowl of chips, about a quarter cup of salsa...if you need more it's $1....no matter how many in your party. If you have six people in your party you get the same amount as someone dining alone. 

The real kicker was we had 3 $25 gift certificates. Our bill was $45...they don't give change and you can't use balance for a tip.  So to not lose out we only used one $25 gift card. We have to go back now. And no the gift certificates were not purchased at a discount.

Really? and order of 2 items is too much for you to handle?  also, I don't like my food thrown at me and the window slammed so I have no chance to ask for something if its not right.

For $23.95, it's a bit pricey (depending on how much sushi you can handle), but I was going in for the challenge. You start by selecting what items you want off their all-you-can-eat menu which does not include everything off their regular menu, but it was still a decent selection nonetheless. There are also appetizers included like vegetable gyoza, noodles, edamame, etc. Although they have specific rolls they offer, they were open to my different customization requests which was great. The sushi served was of good quality and came out pretty quickly after we submitted our order. My favorite was the sweet potato tempura roll. SO GOOD! The overall experience was great, except for the fact that our waitress would disappear for long periods of time. Probably a sign that she wanted us to stop eating all their sushi.",2
15695,1,1546819200000,"I'm quite picky when it comes to Chinese desserts. Mainly because I've been eating it all my life and my parents have spent years trying to perfect their dessert making skills.
So I have to say I'm not impressed here. Did I mention that they don't serve Tofu Pudding?! WHY!

Sesame Paste - ugh, it's worse than the packaged ones I buy from T&T. One look and you know it's not going to be good. Why? Because it's not black enough and it looks glossy. Meaning there's actually probably, most likely very little sesame in it. The sesame aroma is nowhere to be found and all I taste is paste. Not even sweetened paste. Just.. watery paste. If you've ever made sesame paste at home from scratch, you'll know that good black sesame paste dessert will look really black and the black sesame aroma should be strong. And I prefer my black sesame not completely grinded until the point where you can't taste the sesame.

Steamed egg with milk - This is one of my favourite desserts. It was decent. Just not sweet enough and not smooth enough.  
 
I wouldn't come back for desserts, I'll just make my own. But I will come back for one thing. The assorted herbal tea mixed with sweet herbal tea. Perfect after eating too much fried food. It's actually one of the most bitter ones I've had and I like that. It seems to work wonders for my sore throat every time. I also like the fact that they open late and they're cheaper than the other Chinese dessert places.",1

Can't believe I just found that place.

Seriously, just fell in love!

Boyfriend and I went during happy hour, 4-7 everyday. Includes free chips and drink with sandwich order. Probably won't go at any other time, the deal makes it that much better. 

The lady at the register helped break down the menu for us, I decided on the 111 ménage a trois. Love, love, love! Definitely a must try if you like a sweet kick to your sandwiches!  

The boyfriend got the bear hug.  That sandwich is seriously genius. The jalapeño poppers inside are so delicious. 

Can't wait to go back and try the different options! 

I probably won't be stepping inside of a subway ever again!",3

15711,3,1548115200000,"I dig the concept of this place. It's basically a big, open space on King West with big tables, big beer steins, and big hotdogs that can be as fancy as you want it to be. The food, I'll say, is only decent though.

Wvrst is usually jam-packed with people on weekends and tends to be on the very loud side of the noise spectrum. It has a European ambience, which is something that you don't see every day in Toronto.

I'd give it a try with your good friends and see where the night takes you afterwards!",2

We came in last weekend because I was craving FroYo! I liked how the sample cups were on the counter in little stacks. There are some places closer to my house that require the staff getting my samples, I refuse to go there as a result. 

After trying a couple different ones, I got Cake Batter like always. Normally it's just the frozen yogurt and a boatload of fruit (and cookie dough) but you didn't have any fruit besides strawberries and they were partially frozen. 

This is a location I would plan on visiting frequently if you have fruit. So I guess next time I'll walk in, check out the fruit situation first. If not, you can't be the only place near by.",2

We were crossing through there and back from a trip to Indy and is was a good enough experience to return on the way back. The brewer took me on a tour of the facilities and we bantered about state laws and differences between Texas and Indiana. The menu provided option for my entire picky, gluten free eating family. I very much enjoyed the beers. They had a huge selection and not all were perfect, however using beeradvocate and the waiters I was able to parse through the weaker options and pretty much only had great beers. I highly recommend this joint for a nice family restaurant that also has great craft beer.",2
15726,3,1548115200000,"This is for the casino only. My husband and I were there on 05/12/17 and stayed for 7 to 8 hours. The bartenders and waitresses were great, friendly and efficient. We won a little money and were enjoying ourselves until a player by the bar closest to the area where the NBA game was playing started to yell and scream that he was not receiving his cocktails. He was up and down, bothering other players and harassing the waitress demanding he get drinks because he was a big winner ( $80.00 playing .10 ).It was getting busy and he did this for almost an hour. He was so loud he was drowning out the guests who were cheering on their NBA team. There was security all over the casino but he was never approached by one. 

We decided to leave because it did not feel safe. In any other casino in Vegas this behavior would have been stopped immediately and the guest would have been escorted out. 

Overall a smaller casino, older machines and up until that point a good time.",2

A couple of checks on Yelp means we can't find a Cantonese we haven't already tried, so The Great Greek was the target.  Nice little cafe-style casual place, and all the tables except one are full.  Place was super clean, staff were lovely.  Mr M had gyro plate and I got Mezze plate.  Good sized portions, and fresh Greek side salads.  Hummus/Tzatiki (sp??) were pretty nice and pitta bread hot and bendy.  I overheard another family leave and say ""man, that was good, we'll be back"".  I agree.",2

The owner, who is almost always there, is super friendly and excited to have a store to share his creations.  He has added a couple new items to the menu since first opening, and he's all for offering a taste of his latest recipe. He also makes good bread for the buns and it is really good.

Definitely try the Maui Dog (the burger is also really great)!  It has pineapple and coconut, which you wouldn't naturally think to put on a hotdog, but it will surprise you.  The tater tots are also good - really good seasoning and I think there is some kind of onion mixed into the potato. 

I haven't tried the shaved ice yet, but this place also has a GIANT list of shaved iced flavors and offers a great deal on a variety of sizes.

There is also a really nice patio that is dog friendly",2
15736,1,1547424000000,"This is one of my favorite places to get a Thai Tea. There prices and drinks are better than anywhere else. I love the day staff here but unfortunately I went there at night and the people are very rude and inconsiderate. I went in, I ordered 3 drinks. They were all made great and tasted great! I go out to my car and sadly smash my finger in my car door. My husband goes in to ask for a bandaid and some ice, and they said they didn't think they had any bandaids. But what is really frustrating is they didn't even go look to make sure. 

Since the Boba Tea House deals with food and beverages, they should have a stocked first aid kit. It's a health code requirement. I will not be returning even though it's my favorite place.

15811,1,1547683200000,"I used to strongly dislike this place because of the always-smoke-filled atmosphere.  Sitting in the non-smoking section didn't ever do you any good.

The food I thought could be quite good, although it was usually too salty.  My favorite item here on the menu is the Cobb salad, which is very odd because I don't really like Cobb salads, but it's really good here.  I've never had any genuinely bad food here, although I suspect it may depend on what you order because I know many people say it can be quite awful.

The atmosphere is decent.  It's much more cramped than the other two 24-hour diners.  It has a sort of  dark feel to it.

I have not been back to Cleveland since the smoking-ban was enacted.  Perhaps I would up this place to 4 stars?  Still...when I was going to a 24-hour place I usually preferred one of the other two places around the corner, and usually preferred Gold Coast in particular.",3

With whom, I split crab cakes ($8 total for 2 crab cakes on a bed of greens aka a huge salad) and sampled their smoked salmon and lemon greens crepe as well as the baked french onion soup. All four dishes were SO DELICIOUS. The portions were huge and both of the salads that I had were incredibly fresh. Literally, the best salad I have eaten on campus yet.  My quiche was a little small in my opinion, but the sides of a few pieces of cubed apples, potatoes, salad, and a really sweet strawberry made up for it ($8) . If you're looking for a filling meal, definitely go with the crepe or the omelette ($9). My friend's smoked salmon crepe was out of this world delicious. The perfect blend of flavors with nothing too overpowering and just the right amount of seasoning. It also came with three slices of bread, potatoes, and greens, so I definitely think it was the best of all the dishes in terms of portion size.

I've also ordered their breakfast sandwiches (great deal) before and their open faced sandwiches are yummy. If you're looking for a place with a fancy ambiance where you can dress up or down, come here for dinner! The interior is really dim and they light candles at each table, it's very romantic.

Our service was a little slower today than I expected considering it wasn't that full when we went, but our waitress was accommodating with separate checks so no big deal. If I could get this place a 4.5/5 I think that would be the ideal rating.

4) i hate it when waiters try to upsell on the wine, especially when they make it blatantly obvious.

Thank you for reading my post, you will be glad that you did!
Last evening I ordered from this ""hovel"" for the first time.
I placed my order which did not arrive on time.  When 1 hour had passed I called the establishment.  They told me that it would be there soon.
$40.00 dollars later I paid the driver for my bill and a generous gratuity to the driver.  He seemed uncomfortable delivering the food to me and I well understand why.
When I opened the takeout bag with the food two large cockroaches scurried out of the bag!
I cannot tell you how horrible it was!  I managed to kill one of the cockroaches and the other cockroach scurried into my kitchen!
I cannot tell you what the food tasted because I put all of it in the trash.
Govern your self accordingly with ordering from this ""hovel"". I did not want to eat cockroach in a sweet and sour sauce.",3

it has a big ass patio with a bar to match.  you can kick it and fan out if need be.  they also serve food which is also good when you've drank a lot of ""blue martini's..."" (*ahem... very strong drink btw..)

We ordered PB & J, sea bass skewers, nuttin honey shrimp and a flatbread. The PB & J was definitely my favorite, super yummy! Sea Bass just okay, super small portion for 13-15 bucks! Nuttin honey was okay, pretty coated. THe flatbread was pretty good, you cant really mess up flat bread ya know. So yeah, bar food at best, nothing outstanding.

We only had a few oysters, which seemed to be a bit pricy in comparison with other oyster bars in Toronto. Also had the truffle tater tots, which were delicious. I would recommend ordering from their daily menu on the chalkboard instead of the normal menus. The portions were very generous and the staff was very courteous.

It's pretty dang loud however, so it's helpful to sit next to friends rather than across from them. On the weekend, the ""background"" music negates conversation altogether, and the douchebag factor is exponentially higher. 

Better: The draft selection is most excellent! But pricey. Available in litre steins for the manliest of men. 

Best: Lots of different sausages, including some vegan options. It's certainly not a vegetarian's pick by any means, but it's nice that one can tag along with meatetarian friends without starving. The currywurst was lamely one-dimensional, but the wild boar sausage with sauerkraut and jalapenos was ""gamey and flavourful"" as per the boyf. Fries and dipping sauces were yummy as well.

TIP:  It's approximately 6.5 miles from the Albertsons shopping plaza at the corner of W.

This is currently my favorite place to eat, drink, and hangout at Mandalay! I just realized that I love gastropubs and will be adding Libertine to the list.

The food menu changes because they are farm to table (which I appreciate and love) so if you're a yelper like me scrolling through photos, you won't find dishes that are the same because it depends on what is in season.

We sat at the bar and ordered: 

oysters (West Coast) - a must try, sweet and delicious 
beet salad - refreshing
fried olives - to die for!

Service was impeccable. Everyone we encountered was smiling and kind.  The bartenders are so friendly and happy! It's contagious. For me, this speaks volumes about the establishment and how they treat their employees.  

I absolutely love the decor, ambience, and the fact that there's an open kitchen area where you can sit and watch the professionals in action. The back of the restaurant features a wall of glass overlooking the Mandalay Beach. 

There's only one bathroom each for men and women but the rooms are huge. You can fit like 20 people in there. Seriously! But only one toilet, haha.

Nick, the general manager stopped by to say hello and was so gracious as to comp a couple of drinks for us before our Bash at the Beach concert at the Mandalay Beach (thanks to my friend, Ashley, for the connection). Unfortunately, we had to decline because we both were not drinking that night but we were very gracious of the kind offer.

I would definitely recommend this spot. Reminds me a lot of the type of establishments you'd find in NYC. Great food, strong drink menu, and service as it should be.

Such a wonderful spot.  Love dining there.  The view, the wine list, the attentiveness, the renovations they've done so carefully, the ducks...

But am a little frustrated. I made sure to discuss my dietary issues with the owner and hostess as I entered and was thrilled when they proudly handed me a menu with gluten free options - yay!  I know they have a talented kitchen, but it just makes me feel better to know it's part of their training, their daily conversation with staff and kitchen.  

But after I ordered, the manager came out to the table saying ""don't know why the hostess gave you the gf menu, that's only for evening. We don't have a gluten free menu during the day...""   Well - I'm sorry, but I'm gluten free all day long.  

So they still have some work to do.  Particularly since after detailed conversationS with both the server and the manager, the kitchen sent out the tomato salad with bread, dairy, fruit (in dressing) and starch on it which only tells me they're either not listening, or they don't care.  And I want to give them more credit than that because I know that's not how the owner would want them to treat their guests.

So then entree comes - and it's just ok.  Why?  because I didn't really trust the kitchen at this point - but I was so hungry I ate every bite.  Fortunately no issues.  Which is why I only dinged them one star.",2

16044,1,1547942400000,"This has to be the most depressing strip club in the world. Let's get started:
1. They wanted to charge us $17 cover charge at the door. I wondered how did they come up with that number. Why not $13 or $19? We refused to pay and were about to leave when we were approached by a nice cabbie outside that was willing to give us 4 passes for $20. We took the offer and we got in.

2. Before we were able to sit down we were surrounded by girls that wanted to lead us to the private rooms. I wasn't interested but was wiling to their sale pitch. So we all sat in the private room that had broken and rotted ceiling tiles and a bathroom that was probably constructed in 1864. We were told that the room would cost us $60 per half hour + tip. The tip of course was supposed to equal or more value. So $120 minimum to get you started. So we passed on the offer.

3. We stepped out of the private room and were simply looking for some lap dances while we are socializing. Well that pretty much will never happen at that place. The girls will show you no interest unless you want to take them to the private room and throw all of your cash for nothing...

So after about 15-20 min standing around looking pretty we decided to leave. On my way outI was approached by a good looking girl with obviously fake hooters. She asked me if I wanted to have some fun before I left. I told her I don't like fakies and she got sooo mad she started to complain to one of the bouncers.

Even just getting a single roll will fill you for under 10 dollars because each one has eight pieces. Everyone gets free soup and tea after being seated. Just the thing to warm you up! 

The sushi quality here, and some people fight me on this (I'll reluctantly admit) is FANTASTIC. I only really eat sashimi, so it is important to me that the pieces are cut thickly/generously, and they are presented beautifully! Clean and fresh--give it a whirl. 10/10!",2

The player had just signed with another team and they told me that I couldn't have the sandwich because the player didn't play for the Penguins anymore.  At first I thought she was joking, but she was serious, and I couldn't get the sandwich.  

I literally was grossed out by the smell of the Mojito Chicken sandwich that was served to me on my first visit.  On my final visit I ordered the Plane Jane Street pizza (standard cheese pizza, pretty hard to mess up), the crust was soggy, it was over garlic'ed, and there was some kind of sauce on the edge of my pizza that I had no idea what it was.  Luckily the sauce didn't have any flavor so it didn't impact the pizza.

Appetizer- Dungeness crab cocktail. Okay. I am spoiled by Seattle's seafood so I have high expectations. Yes. The crab is good. Cold and refreshing. However for $25 dollars I rather have tried something else as I can get much more up north. However it was good. 
Steak- bone in filet was their signature so that's the one we chose. I think they cooked it exactly the way we wanted. Medium rare. It was tender and it was good, but not melt in your mouth fantastic. It was overshadowed by (dun dun dun) the fish!!! 
Seafood- Chilean sea bass. I got it the ""arreganato"" way. I probably butchered the word too. Holy crap this was amazing. It melted in your mouth and left you wondering where the heck it went so you just kept going back for more. 
Sides: thanks to the yelper who gave the advice to get half the amt of gnocchi. Omg this is soooo good. The truffle oil just perfected it. Best gnocchi ever!!
Lobster mashed potatoes was a huge portion (had to take it to go!) I am not really a mashed potato or lobster fan but my bf is and he really liked it so definitely try one of these sides.

16159,1,1546905600000,"I came here for brunch with my girlfriend on a recent trip to Vegas. I'm a little torn, the service was great but overall I felt like the entire experience didn't quite live up to my expectations.

Pros: Service was on point. They don't allow reservations for brunch so we decided to get here as early as we could (easier said than done after a night out in Vegas)! We arrived around 9:00 and were seated immediately which was great, I was expecting a longer wait. Our server was friendly and very attentive. Our food came out quick and our water glasses were always refilled in a timely manner.

The ambiance here is great. The decor gives it a really classy feel, much like the rest of the Venetian hotel. Huge windows bring in a lot of natural lighting. Feels like it would be a really nice place to eat at for dinner as well.

Cons: Finding the restaurant is a little tricky. You walk through the casino and the hotel lobby towards a hall that leads to a different set of elevators. The casino does have multiple signs that help point you in the right direction.

The food was good but for the prices we paid I guess I was just expecting a little more, I wasn't really blown away like I thought I would be. Based on other user's pictures I decided to order the croque madame. Serving size was good, the dish came with a heaping side of fries. The egg on top was cooked nicely. My girlfriend ordered their omelet of the day. Again, just like the croque madame the overall dish was good but for the price I don't think it was up to par.

Would I come back again? Maybe, I would consider giving them another shot but it's not on the top of my list for brunch spots.",2
16164,3,1547596800000,"Nice and organized shop. This is the first location I've actually been inside of.  Everything was set up nicely.  The staff was friendly, welcoming, and helpful.  This is the closest location to my house, so I will most always come here.  I can't wait to stop back by!  These cakes are like nothing I've had before, absolutely delicious.  There isn't one that I didn't like, however I favor the strawberry and white white chocolate.  Melt in your mouth delicious.  I am obsessed!!!",2
16176,3,1546819200000,"We stopped in today and really enjoyed this place.
There are many individual dealers selling everything from lamps to vintage furniture and toys.
The staff are really helpful.
We found great ideas for the garden and I saw items to buy for gifts. 
I found three small bedside like tables to buy. We have to pick up sofas today so we did not finalize anything today.
There are many sellers who have good vinyl records.
Prices I thought were reasonable. Even 1800s dressers and chairs were not so high as to be prohibitive.
The u turn going east at Alta Drive is pretty nutty so just turn left if you must on Decatur before the light at Alta. some ditzy woman almost creamed us with her right turn from hell.
We will definitely be back soon.",2

My kids think it is just as good as it was before, however I am on the divorce diet and can not taste anything.  So this review will be based off of their need to eat there once a week - literally.  

They remember who we are.  The wait staff is awesome, always telling me how nice it is to have kids with manners (thank you, I try!) they know my kids know where the ""special"" chop sticks are, and let them get their own.  The cooks are great, throw fake food (sometimes real!)  at you, make lots of fire, and put on a good show! 

If you are on a budget, go for lunch.  You get the same amount of food for 1/2 the price. Kids meals start at $8 - same for lunch and dinner.  It is like having a 2 hour baby sitter!!",2

16194,3,1548028800000,Nothing but compliments as far as the drinks and atmosphere. The vault downstairs is amazing and the bartenders and barbacks are smoking hot .  A lot of time and effort goes into each drink and are well worth a generous tip.  The food is ok and the deep dish is basically the equivalent of DiGiorno. Nachos were great and the service is second to none. The crowd seen here is younger-middle aged professional to typical Madison hipster. Great place to have a few drinks with friends or coworkers but don't be surprised if your bill ends up being over $100 as the drinks are more on the expensive side. Understandable as they want to attract a certain crowd.,2

The fries were baked in a toaster oven and the pickle was so soft and salty it was inedible. If I actually paid the full price of $10.71 I would have returned it.  Service was painfully slow.",1

Unbeknownst to me I called to confirm my order to a call center in AK. Then when received my pizza there was no cheese. What the heck?? Why would I order that!!!!  When I called the center basically they were rude and said we can't do anything about it. They gave me the store managers # and when I called I received a text (unprofessional) saying he would call me back (which never happened). The pizza looked gross and the service was poor!!! If I had a choice I wouldn't even give it 1star. don't order from here. We were here on vacay and this started us off bad!  Very disappointed. At least the driver got a $7 tip.,1

Potato Salad is incredible.  Cole Slaw is pretty good too.  Excellent deals for Seniors from 1pm to 6pm.
And if you like pancakes, their breakfast special is awesome.

The bathroom was a bit cramped.  Towels were worn (but clean).  The shower controls were very loose and imprecise (hard to get warm water). 
The TV remote died (which could just have been the batteries).  The phone never worked (though admittedly I didn't care to get it fixed).  And the alarm clock had to be unplugged because the radio couldn't be turned off (only very very low).
All of which to say, minor complaints.",2
16304,1,1547424000000,"Deweys has ok coffee, food and service. Nothing great. Of note is the fact that they actually close significantly earlier than it says online. They do benefit however from being the only coffee shop in shaker square.

First, coffee. They advertise some fancier roasts, but their execution could use some work. I'm a latte person, and generally find s smidge of a burnt taste. 

As to food, it's all pre-made or the like. They do do some nice side salads if you are looking for something quick and the options are usually within a decent health reasoning.

As for service, they are abysmally slow. I waited twenty minutes once for two coffees and a hot chocolate. They are very kind, but also very free spirited and take their time with their service. Not an in and out type place. Also,  its just a pet peeve of mine, but they have been hanging a sign for a while now that reads ""bring ur own wine."" Really?",2

My party would not have visited if it weren't for the coupons. Food was medicore and there weren't many selections. Not sure how much it is walking in without coupon but I'm sure it's not worth it unless it's $10-$15. Spend your money and stomach space for better buffets in Vegas.",2

Yes, it might be a little higher priced than other grocery store options in Madison, but the customer service, quality, and variety of food is worth it.  They have a good selection of local foods in pretty much every section of the store and they are easy to spot because they are market with the distance the food traveled to get there! 

Their deli, cheese, meat and seafood counters really don't compare to anywhere else that I go.  The selection is large, the staff is knowledgeable, and the food is delicious. The cheese section in particular blows me away with the variety every time. 

Aside from the some higher prices the only thing that I really can say bad about this place is that the parking lot is a mess if you come when it is busy - but that might have to do more with the mall and Target than the actual grocery store.",1

Everything came out within 90 seconds...none of it was hot...and it was definitely not cooked to order.

Got excited about a 24/7 pizza place that delivers and ordered without thinking about checking reviews. We ordered a two medium special for 14.99, bill was 20 and change with delivery not including tip.

We ordered a four topping pizza and a specialty pizza with two items removed and one added.  Pizza arrived quickly, but when we opened the boxes one pizza was correct and the other was a plain cheese pizza.  Called the driver back (had the number from him calling about the gate code), he said the order was for a cheese pizza and the four topping, so not like he switched boxes and the order could be quickly corrected. We settled for what we got.

The pizza quality was terrible. I was starved going in and could only eat a little before giving up. The toppings were ok, but very scarce, sauce tasted like canned tomato paste.  The worst part was the crust, which might be the worst crust I've had on a pizza; it was thick, hard, and similar to cardboard.  I would have been much more satisfied with a frozen pizza.",2

What does that tell you?  We ordered Thai Beef Salad, the Cognac Duck, and Garlic Pork and Pepper Rice Bowl.  The server said that they were out of the Beef Salad (huh?..at 12:00 in the afternoon??).  I didn't know if they were out of the Beef or the salad greens?  In any event, we ended up ordering the Steamed Cod.  OMG!  The Cognac Duck was tasty, but portions are really small, only about 7-8 small bites of duck.  The Garlic Pork was very tasty (seasoned ground pork all mixed up in a bowl with rice and an egg on top).  It was not appealing to the eye, it was like fried rice in a bowl.  I kept biting into something really small and hard (I think it was fried garlic or something, hopefully it wasn't fragments of small pieces of bone).  I was afraid I was going to crack a tooth.  The steamed cod was absolutely horrid.  This was definitely a frozen cod that was probably ""defrosted"" before steaming, or possibly went from the freezer to the steamer.  It was rubbery and chewy.  I would have sent it back, but decided not to, because the server was nice.  I took it to go and trashed it when I got home.  The price for all three was about $39.00.  I didn't want to order sushi there because the fish has to be really fresh or I get sick easily.  Since nobody was there during the lunch rush, I figured the food isn't moving as quickly, so the raw fish might be kind of old.  Didn't want to chance it.  My guess is that this restaurant won't be here in a year.",2
16502,1,1547942400000,Came by at 7:30 pm on a Thursday because your hours on yelp say you're open until 9 but the door was locked. Maybe update that so people don't make a useless trip.,2
16506,1,1546473600000,Excellent location. Fast friendly. Even honored my punch pass from another store. Great prices and good take and bake pizza.,2
16507,3,1548547200000,"After reading some glowing reviews of Bandera (specifically of their 'best on the planet' cornbread) here on Yelp, Krashawnda just had to try the place. We went on a Friday night and were quoted a wait time of about 45 minutes, though they actually were able to get us in a bit quicker. The hostess was extremely helpful and polite and accommodated us really well; even though we missed our name being called while we were out walking... upon returning she was overly apologetic and concerned with getting us the next available table even though it wasn't her fault... kudos for that. 

The ambience in the place is superb. As some others have mentioned it is a little dark, but we enjoyed that and found it to be rather relaxing and romantic. If you happen to be on a date this would be a great place to snuggle up in a booth together to enjoy the night. The darker lighting and decor creates a classy feel without feeling too pretentious like some other Scottsdale locales... although like any nice Scottsdale restaurant it's going to be hard to completely avoid the 'tool factor'... you're still likely to see a few spray tanned  Scottsdalians with their collars popped getting fueled for a night of mindless club hopping. 

Now for the best thing about this place... the food! The menu is pretty basic, no Cheesecake Factory bible-sized menus; just one page chock full 'o yummy easily recognizable dishes. We started out with a couple of appetizers; the deviled eggs and the much talked about cornbread. First off the deviled eggs were very tasty... I'm not sure what they used in them, but they had this slightly chunky consistency and the taste was different than the usual homemade deviled eggs I'm used to... kind of like deviled eggs on steroids; very good and cheap (About three bucks for four of them, perfect just to try). Next on the docket was the much ballyhooed cornbread. I've never been a huge fan of cornbread... but I have to admit; the other Yelpers are right on the money here; it's the best cornbread I've ever had. Each bite was like little fireworks of buttery crunchy goodness going off in my mouth. They cook the cornbread in this perfect way so that it's crunchy on the outside yet soft and moist on the inside. It really is heavenly... and this is coming from someone who usually passes on cornbread. For our main dish we split the rotisserie chicken sandwich and a half rack of pork ribs. Both were amazing... the ribs fell right of the bone and were served on a bed of super thin crunchy French fries. The chicken in the sandwich was cooked perfectly and just melted in your mouth. The sandwich also came with a small salad which was sprinkled with some kind of nuts and tasted very fresh. The portions were perfect... not too much but certainly enough to fill you up. We saved just enough room to try their 'Homemade Oreo Cookie Sandwiches'... and I'm really glad we did, I squealed with delight each bite I took... it was amazing. They were basically two medium sized crispy chocolate cookies stuffed with homemade Oreo ice cream... served on a bed of hot fudge. It was everything I imagined it would be and more; definitely one of those deserts that doesn't disappoint you when they bring it out. It's one of the best desserts I've had in a while. 

To add to everything, the service was also very prompt and courteous. We didn't have to wait long for our food (which is always nice) and our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We definitely got the feeling that they train their wait staff very well, the only close to negative thing I could say is that sometimes they might come off a little fake and disingenuous with how they always have a huge smile on their face; there's that feeling that they might be being nice to your face, then complaining about you when they're not by your table... but that's really nitpicking, in fact I don't know why I even mentioned it. One nice quirk was when they brought us our bill the 'customer copy' of the receipt was neatly folded over the credit card like a little piece of origami... cool little things like that make a big difference when looking back at your dining experience. 

From start to finish I'd have to say the place really blew us away... it's definitely the total package and it's somewhere I look forward to eating at again. I can't imagine anyone going here and giving the place anything less than four stars. As it stands right now it's a solid 5/5 from us. If you're in the mood for some solid grub in the medium price range this place is a sure shot",2

My friend, welcome to the place where millionaires shop for groceries.  

Okay, I have no idea if that statement is accurate.  But, how many grocery stores do you go to that play classical music?  

This place pays a lot of attention to detail and it shows.  The store is very clean, bright, well laid out, and bears a friendly staff that is eager to help.  The produce department is world-class, with fresh clean produce that doesn't disappoint.  

I think what I appreciate the most about this place is the huge deli and prepared foods section.  If you're in need of a ready made meal or something hot and tasty, this is the place to get it.  

One downside is the selection.  The store and aisles are too small to accommodate a large selection, so don't expect to find 13 different brands of canned diced tomatoes.  But they do have a generic brand for most items.  

The prices are a bit high, but not unreasonable.  In this case, you're paying more for the shopping experience and the quality of products.  

Also, parents, they have nice carts with attached cars.  Plus a tiny cart with a flag on it that says ""Customer in training.""  When you're shopping with a two year old, that is HUGE.

Bottom line, I like this place a lot.  I just wish their prices were a bit lower.  But I'm willing to pay the premium for the better experience than other stores in town.",2

High exposed ceilings, 2 level split, divided by a brass railing, metal chairs, wooden table surfaces, silver chandeliers, restaurant is a corner unit has an outdoor patio, windows on one side bring in natural sunlight. 

Decor, pale tangerine dark chestnut theme. The Brasil national flag, Christ the Redeemer, and large mural of the city of Rio adore the walls. There's a large LCD TV on the far by the kitchen and projector screen. 

The place has all the hallmarks of a neighborhood football gathering spot. :)


I opted for the steak picanha for lunch ($18), on the side it came with collard greens, rice, beans, and fried bananas. It was a very balanced meal, fragrant, very colorful looking plate. The food was perfectly spiced and tasty. Capped it off right with a rich decadent slice of custard pie.

Dagwoods is the first place I think of when I'm looking for a (big) sandwich. You won't find a better sandwich shop in town. The fresh bread puts it above other places that I love so much. The only thing I wasn't really a fan of was their corned beef, but I only tried it once and Danny's or Slyman's is the place to go for that anyhow. 

Don't expect anything fancy inside, it is still Parma...and if you're going for a great sandwich, I'm pretty sure ambiance should be last on the list anyhow. It's clean though - they just put all of their attention into making incredible sandwiches instead of decorating.

Fine by me.",2

Arrogant Butcher epitomizes what I like to see in a gastropub: good quality upscale comfort food, unique drinks, edgy vibe, and friendly service. It's not cheap, but their happy hour (only on weekdays) from 3-6pm is a pretty fabulous deal. I had their chicken parmesan burger (decadent breaded chicken covered with primavera sauce and cheese) with fries the first time, and their ""pretzels"" (more like pretzel bread) with cheese and caesar salad the second time, along with a strawberry and thyme drink. I was only slightly disappointed with the pretzels with cheese (a huge basket of essentially bread...and cheese dipping sauce is not worth $10), but everything else delivered.

on my previous visits here service was mediocre at best - not even a hint of smile or desire to be helpful from the employees.

I was told that if I were to bring my wheel in early Friday or Saturday, it could be repaired by the end of the day. I hurried and brought my wheel in as soon as I could which was at the end of day on Friday. I was told that my wheel needed to be replaced as it was in too rough a shape to be worth repairing. Since they were hurrying to close, my information was taken down and I was promised a call-back from the master technician (who had at that point left for the day) on Saturday.

So he was giving someone a parting statement as picking up the phone, it would appear. I asked to speak to the bike technician and I was asked how he could help me. I gave him the situation and he said that someone would be calling me back that day. Several hours later, I wanted to know if I could ride my bike to work the next day, so I called them back. I asked to speak to the bike tech, and I was asked to hold. Someone else then picked up, and I asked if I was speaking to Steven to which I got ""How can I help you"" as a response. I told him they had my wheel and I was wondering if they had any updates. He told me that it needed to be replaced as the hub on it was bad as were a bunch of the spokes. When I asked him what the price range would be for a new one, he replied that I should call back on Monday as they could get a hold of their distributor then to see what the prices are so they can order one for me then. I called Urbane Cyclist, where they had the wheel in-stock and said they were able to do the replacement of the wheel in 15 minutes. I then got a call back on Tues being told that the repairs of the wheel would cost $10 less than a new one and truing of it would basically be impossible, so they recommended getting a new wheel. I decided not to do any repairs/replacement for the time being.

So with this experience in mind, the quality of this store has gone way down in my books.",2

We checked it out before bringing my mom, and met with the chef and owner ( who claimed he worked at yellowtail in the Bellagio and Nobu at Ceasars we love Nobu so decided thus was the place for moms birthday dinner! Bonus the Chef seemed very nice!

When we arrived 5 adults & 2 toddlers we were hungry and excited, however we met with the two worst servers!!! They were extremely rude, unfriendly, and lacked knowledge they also never checked on us after our first order ?? We had to leave our table three times to request food, drinks, and get this our check!!! Don't worry they didn't forget to charge us a 20% gratuity charge! 

After two hours of sitting we left hungry and spending just under $200.00 with no dessert for my mom or any of us!! Because although green tea cheesecake is on the menu the server said it was not available today they were sold out at 6pm and no business?! Okay make it up to us with some ice cream... 1/4 scoops with fingerprints actual finger prints!!!!  On our ice cream so disgusting!!!

Thankfully we went to cream at downtown summerlin after for taco Tuesday and as always they were great! And saved our day!",1

I came inside around 9:45 PM knowing they close at 10 PM. Didn't think it was a problem because a sandwich is something very simple to make. I know from experience because I myself worked at Jimmy Johns for 2 years. We were supposed to close at 10 PM. But would stay open an EXTRA 10 minutes because we care so much about our customers. Anyway, back to my experience at this location. I stood there for 10 min while the man was cleaning. He saw that I was in there but didn't bother saying a word. He then speaks up and says ""Ma'am we are closed"" I look at my clock and it was 9:50 PM and I tell him that it says that Subway closes at 10 PM. He then says ""we close at 9:50"" I am so angry. The fact that he just kept cleaning and didn't even acknowledge his customer. And how they supposedly close at 9:50 now?! Unbelievable. He needs to go. He obviously doesn't even care about the company. There are people out there who would never pull that crap but probably got turned down because they allow a moron like him to work there.",2

No complaints about the texture - nice and flaky against the thick, creamy custard. However, the taste was nothing to write home about. It was too sweet and lacked any sort of distinct taste. The lady was very nice however, and does deserve some recognition for her great service. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll try a different pastry, as they do have quite a few.",2

chicken tikka- the base was very tastey and flavorful. the chicken was dry but thats ok im happy there is chicken tikka in my mouth

kadahi chicken- not too heavy which is a first but still good. chicken was juicy and thick enough base where it stuck to the rice and chicken

aloo gobi- which is a potato, cauliflower spice dish was very tastey and flavorful. a bit spicey for me cuz im weak sauzze but i didnt care. 

what i noticed about this place is that their food was not heavy...usually when i have indian its like im prego and can skip a meal or two afterwards. prices are great 5.99 for 1 meat entree or 1 veggie entree for 4.99...i will be back to lick the pans they said i can if i wanted to.",1

Then, it is only a $2 bus fare to the airport. If you plan on staying longer (than a week?) then you should go to the office and fill out a form so they have your vehicle on record. I went on a 12 day trip with no problems. If you happen to be flying out during holidays, you just might be out of luck since parking is on a first come first served basis and the lots fill up fairly quickly. If you drive by and it is full, you will have to park at the airport. There are businesses across the street, but you might get towed from there.",2

The hanger steak and the Morcilla sausage were a must have...Don't waste your money on the jamon ibrico is not worth the $25, it's no better than proscuitto. Also we ordered $80 worth of drinks and they still didn't comp out corkage fee. Overall as always Justin is amazing, but I think the service and pricing still need work.",2

I didn't think it was possible to have a Westin-like hotel in the Chambana area (I mean, seriously, this is the same place that offers barn-dances for fun group nights out), without actually having the Starwood brand move in, but good god Chambana! I'm SO totally impressed!!

A joint project between the University and Fox/Atkins Development, this is SUCH a beautiful hotel- very boutique-like, and the rooms are so plush- modern, with NOVELS as part of the decor! (I spent one night reading King Arthur!)

Located at the northern end of  Research Park, it's BANG next to Memorial Stadium and Assembly Hall, and within walking distance of the new ARC (formerly known as IMPE). 

It's not the cheapest place (by Chambana standards of course- $132/night including tax), but boy, is it luxurious!! It's comparable to any sort of smaller boutique hotel in a larger city such as the Chi or even NYC.

Bottom line- if you're looking for how Chambana can do upscale, you've come to the right place!",3

The store itself is medium sized and nicely organized. I didn't see any clothing I was interested in, but I did notice that on Fridays they have a $15 bag of clothing day.

The day I went (Wednesday) it was half off books. I was tempted to purchase a large 1950's science book but abstained. I did end up getting a very cool 1950's glassware set for casual parties. Now I just need to have a casual party.

She is rude, confrontational and unhelpful. From my first encounter in June 2015 for bio-identical HRT it has been nothing but problematic. The only reason why I continue to go to them is because Dr. Petok was the only doctor her accepting insurance. And the only reason why I continue to go is because my husband and I are both currently unemployed and can't afford to go anywhere else. I am a very informed patient and pro-active in my own care. They seem to not support this; instead to just do as they say. It is very difficult to communicate with them. Debbie her assistant never seems to understand what I'm saying or asking when I ask her to relay a message to the doctor. She will tell me the doctor is out of the office or busy or tell me she doesn't know what she'll say or do and some how take offense - when I'm simply asking her to ask the doctor for me. The last time I called and asked her to ask the doctor what should I do because I thought the new prescription was keeping me up at night. I was told to keep using it for a least a month. I said ok but again what can I do in the meantime since I was only getting 2-4 hours of sleep per night for over a week and I was nothing feeling well and was exhausted. They definitely lack people skills and that's very sad since that's a big part of their professional - people and helping people.  I'm hoping and praying that I can find another doctor soon.

I sad hello and asked her how she was doing and she did not answer me even though we were the only two besides a kitchen cook.   She was rude.   I asked he for a sauce with my pad thai.  She said it would be $1.00 dollar each.   I explained it was offered and i did not pay for it on th occasion before.   She immediately went off on me talking about her efforts in making it and so on.  I am thinking she may be family of the owners and may not represent all employees but the experience was enough to vow to never return.

The store is well stocked with the basics for auto repair in your own driveway. Tools including socket sets, spark plugs, new batteries, aftermarket air intakes, muffler tips. Accessories including license plate borders, sticker letters/numbers if you want to make your Camry a 4x4 or make your F150 a Camry, seat and steering wheel covers, novelty valve stem caps, etc.

Staff is friendly and helpful. You can get your battery checked and of course replaced if necessary. It doesn't seem to me that they rig their machine to give a bad reading in their favor.

I work in hospitality so I understand complaining guests or if it's busy. But it really bugged me to see the place not very busy, and what appears to be a manager standing around by the bar talking to two different groups of guys and no one else. Two serves sitting down eating, leaving two bar tenders to run the place. 

Our server only came up to our table to take our order. He walked past us multiple times avoiding eye contact. No other server offered service. I made more eye contact with the cooks than anyone actually on the floor.  
 
The food was ok. I had the sea food Mac n cheese and the boyfriend had the ribs special. He said the ribs were watered down and they didn't put enough BBQ sauce on them(trying to get the waiter to bring a side of it would have taken another 20 minutes).

I've had times when the pad Thai, at a 3, is more than I can handle. At other times, I've ordered a curry at ""medium"" only to find out it's not spicy in the least...
Basically, I think this place is a solid choice for Thai, but it's by no means earth-shattering or anything like that. I actually like the lunch options better than dinner here. The first few times I've eaten at Swaddee's have  all been at lunch, and I've been impressed. But then I ordered the Panang curry to-go, for dinner. I asked for it with tofu, and I got a curry with tofu and onions. That's it. No veggies, nothing. That's really odd for a Thai restaurant. It wasn't flavorful, either. Then I went here last week for dinner, and ordered pad Thai. The noodles were a bit dry and hard, although I have to say, the service was great.
All in all, I think I'll continue to come here for lunch, but when it comes to dinner, I'll probably try to seek out some new Thai restaurants.",2

The Scramble was runny, had too much cream cheese, and was flavorless. The Blueberry Pancakes were OK but the blueberries were minimal and lacking in taste. Also, the plates/food/syrup were all cold which is a pet peeve with me - I want my meal to be served HOT - show me you care. The potatoes served with the Scramble are much better than those served at their sister restaurant - Marigold Kitchen - but overall Marigold or Original Pancake House are better choices for breakfast.",2

During the ride there, they made us sign a standard waiver about getting hurt and another one about not messing with any desert turtles.  I made the reservation for myself, my BFF and my son.  However, when it came time to pay for the excursion, he (sorry - I can't remember anybodys name, my short term memory is bad right now)  wanted us to put it all on one credit card.  There were three people, three credit cards.  The guy was being really difficult about this, he did not want to do this because it was more work for him.  One of the credit cards would not work with his system or something....I will get to that at the end but that ended up being a thing.  So, we go thru the lessons, that was great, we start the tour, that was great until my BFF flipped her ATV because of a rock she could not swerve to miss.  That's when it started going downhill.  They looked at the ATV and were like ""well the handle bars would need to be replaced, the fender was bent, the will have to have the mechanic look at the ATV"", you could literally hear the cash register ringing up a total LOL.  So, they helped her up and said they would have the mechanic look at when we went back to base at the half way point.  OK, back on the road.  We make it to the halfway point, they assess her ATV and decide to only charge her $20 for the flag that she bent in the flip. Now, we are on the second leg of the tour and my son flips his ATV, and it is the same song and dance.  However, when we finally get back to base, they say he owes $120 for his accident.  They start stumbling over each other and actually said ""well we were not going to charge your friend for her handle bars, we were just more or less giving you a 2 for 1 on the handle bar replacement"", but it had already been established that she just needed to pay for the flag.  The thing is, they were like you need to pay us now, in cash for the ATV repair.  Wait, what? No invoice, I can't price out ATV handle bars? I am just taking your word for this?  These were older ATVs, I am sure they have a graveyard full of ATVs somewhere and they would pop off the old handle bars and put on the new ones.  ($60 for used bars and replacement here in Dallas).  AND, if the ATV was so damaged that the handle bars needed replacing...why was he still allowed to ride that ATV for the remainder of the tour(at least an additional hour)?  I felt like a sucker paying them that money but at this time, they had MY drivers license because, since my credit card did not go through, I was told they would hold on to my DL, and on the way back to the hotel drop off, the driver would stop at an ATM and allow me to get the cash out, once I paid the driver, then he would give me my DL back, so I figured if we didn't pay for the handle bars, they would keep my DL since the reservation was in my name.  On the way back, we went to the ATM, the driver actually left the other 8 people in the van (the a/c was intermittently working in the van) and walked in to the store with me and literally stood by my side as I got money out of the ATM.  The price of the ATV tour was an odd dollar amount, of course the driver did not have change (according to one of the tour guides, they are like everyone else in Vegas and LIVE off of tips) so I am assuming he thought I would not break the twenty and allow them to keep the change.  Naw, I already feel super hoodwinked by you guys.   

The ATV part was fun, they were really good about making sure everyone stayed together and there were frequent water breaks,  It was August, but was not but not unbearable.  The medic guy, was really sweet.  Would I ATV in Vegas again?  Absolutely, just not with them.",2

She had forgotten a third of the drinks until the food came. Watered down my friend's soda when she refilled it and forgotten her extra order of fries until she was done eating. Despite asking for a refill on my water, I had to pull out my own bottle of water to finish eating. She also did a mix and match on our separate bills.

The quiche was premade and should have been served up within a relatively timeline basis. My friends omelette came before my quiche. The guy just yells omlette, not with the 3 toppings he asked for, like omlette with tomato, cheddar cheese, and soy chorizo. My friend got a plate with just the omelette, no potatoes like the menu specified. So he asked the guy and he said Oh I'm heating them up. We get the potatoes and they were cold. 
 I asked about my quiche and apparently they forgot I ordered it. He said he will get it and it will be out in about 5 minutes. He brings it out, and told me to be careful because it is hot. So I waited about a minute took a bite and it wasn't very hot, it was cold. I had my friend try it and he basically said it was never heated. So I took it back told him it was cold. So he took the plate  and I walked away .  He came out about 10 minutes later and served the same piece that I had taken a bite. Um yuck, sanitary?? Not to mention that it was dry and still  not hot. The coffee was not very hot  and it was weak . I could have got three coffees at QuikTrip  for the price I paid for just one and they would taste better and be hot. Also, it is 42 degrees outside why do you have the air conditioned blasting on customers, 3 people came up and asked if she could turn it off. She was clueless on how to do so.

""I'm looking at you on the camera."" - Trump International Hotel Las Vegas Security Officer Giel called after searching for me in the surveillance video for 1.5 hours and, at my request, another 15 minutes to finally spot me. It sounded creepy if there was no context, but I grinned from the inside with the new hope to be a step closer to the search for the camera I had left behind in a cab I got on.

""You were with a skinny guy in light blue shirt right?""
""Uh... I call him fat.""
Officer laughed.

The night was too dark and the video was too blurry for Officer Giel to help me spot the cab number (so I can find the camera I left behind), but he was able to give me the cab colors(!!!) and two cab companies to track down.

Who would've thought hotel security would go through such troubles for customers?
Kudos to Trump's Security! Thank you Mr. Officer Giel! =)

My friend and I ordered, paid, and received our food in under 5 min; I ordered the beef udon bowl and a mini rice bowl, which came out by the time we paid (super fast!) while my friend's took a bit longer for the carbonara.

I asked the bartender if we could sit anywhere and it also was a kinda yes and no. I asked about drink specials until we could get decide on a seat, she grabbed the menu and told me I could get captain Morgan vodka double for $5. I said they make a vodka now? She said yes I can mix it with coke or whatever. Which is hilarious when you read on I'll tell you about the Pepsi. 
So we grab a waitress, the slowest droopy drearest one we could find, well the only one. The other girl was running around cause she kept forgetting everything we later discovered from over hearing the table next to us. Anyway we pop a squat on a high top till we beg Jackie 2 times to bus that table so we can sit in chairs not stools. She offers drinks until then, very good. A bucket of beer with 10 ice cubes and a captain Morgan vodka and soda. LOL Sat at the end of the bar waiting to be delivered for a bit, a couple all in black guys strolled along, didn't grab them to deliver nor was anyone cleaning the table. She said she would get it. She decided to take a order from a 4 top in the mean while. I guess a big party just left, but I only seen 2 dirty tables and 6 busy ones. NO one was at the string of high tops. Then she wanted to take are order, I said I'm still waiting for that table. Tell your boss you need help, NO I'll just do it. She replied. She moved like all she had to eat was valium that day. And the brain activity was just as slow.

To the food, the Miller's seafood bake? Awful boiled in water with some seasoning powered here and there. Brought in a net bag. Dry as a fart. Corn mushy and clams cold, awful I'm sure the air condition that was on blasting ceiling fans and the Windows open at 91 degrees out didn't help. I actually opened a wet nap and in less then 3 minutes (yes I did I it twice) it was a piece a loose leaf paper. The waitress had no interest in hearing what I was saying. I DID 3 times attempt to get our unhappiness across.
 I asked for a COLD glass with salt and lime for my now warm beer. Knew that was going to happen when the bucket only had 10 cubes. She says ""we have Pepsi"" again I said, same response. We looked at each other and my date said ""NO, an empty glass, cold with.."" She interrupted with ""oh duh, ok"". And the bartender things you serve coke? Huh? Maybe they do have both, im not sure. 
The foil baked mahi was SO SO a bit dry and NO flavor.
Then the fire place came on, Wtf? It's mid June in Vegas!! The table next to us even was shocked. Wth is going on. First open the huge ass Windows to null and void the air condition, then a fire? 
We were SO over this dinner we grabbed our last beers and went out side. Just to noticed the same two glasses on the table outside next to the couch, that we noticed ON THE WAY IN!! We were soooooooo over this evening I would have strangled a manager if I would of demanded to talk to one. 
Low and behold, the fire pits kick on outside. We ran for the car!!! Worst $66 plus tip, I don't know why I did that. Ever!!!
 I hope to go back in a few months with a totally different out come. All the experienced people out of work, and this is what they come up with. Shame on you! OH and they didn't have the dessert he wanted either. Poor guy we stopped at McDonald's on the way home from dinner, sad..

As we returned to our hotel room one Saturday night in Vegas to freshen up to go out and gamble, we thought we'd save some time and order up some pizza so it would be there after showers and primping. The day before, we found a flyer stuck to our room door for Top This Pizza and we figured we'd utilize the good coupon deals they were offering. I called the establishment several times, but the call didn't go through (tried on cells and the landline in the room) so I placed the order online. They called about fifteen minutes later to confirm the order. Then an hour and a half goes by.  I figured ok, it's Saturday night at 11pm in Vegas. Understandable. Finally, the delivery man calls my cell and says he's downstairs at the valet and would I come down there to pick up the pizza. I asked him why he wasn't coming up to the room and he informed me that they did not deliver to the rooms, even though they called previously to confirm the order and the room number.  I was pretty surprised, and as I was still trying to get ready to go out for the night, I sent another one of our party down with some cash to pick it up.  Several minutes later he called again asking where I was. I reminded him that I sent someone down and described the person collecting the pizza. He called twice more in a matter of minutes, becoming ruder and ruder as I assured him that our friend was indeed down at the valet looking for him, and had been for several minutes.  We asked again why we paid a $6 delivery charge if they refuse to deliver the pizza to the room to which he replied, ""We don't like to deliver to that location.""  We then told him to shove the pizza up his butt and went downstairs to Johnny Rockets instead.  Glad I was paying cash! Save yourself some aggravation and do NOT order from these clowns.",2

I regret not getting the reps name but, honestly, that's customer service when you explain all the options available and work with us to find a solution.

I get you might be attracted by the $5 menu but you need to be prepared for small portions and paying extra for condiments like vinegar.  Yes, they charged us $1 for a tiny cup of vinegar folks.  I have to say the food doesn't taste bad considering the low price tag - it's just that there isn't much of it.

It's really not a pleasant environment to relax and eat a meal unless you are lucky enough to sit on the patio when the blaring music isn't an issue.  I don't understand why the music needs to be unbearably loud.

It's all up to you on which flavor you prefer, my personal favorite is the white chocolate raspberry and double chocolate on top of chocolate.

I ordered corn beef hash last weekend and the portion was so small that you could barely see it among the potatoes. My friend said something about it before I even noticed. I said something to the waitress and she said that was the typical small portion. I will likely go back, but will never order that again.",2

Quaint does not even begin to describe Biscuits. While waiting in the lobby to be seated you sit on haystacks surrounded by cute kitschy stuff you might have seen at your grandma's house.

Once seated we requested coffee and were served the typical watered-down diner type coffee. I ordered my typical cheese omelette with hash browns and got a decent omelette it was okay.  I don't think that omelettes are the primary entree for this restaurant. 

I do believe the name says it all. I'm not a toast and biscuit type person but my husband is. He absolutely could not say enough good things about the biscuits.",2

Because you never know...you might have a good time. Or you might not. It's definitely one of those hit-or-miss kind of places, and draws a late-night crowd.

The building itself is fairly non-descript. It shares a parking lot with a smoke shop, and a small sign on the roof is your only clue that you are looking at a sports bar.

The atmosphere is definitely unpretentious and laid-back. It isn't super-spacious, but let's face it: at the end of the night, after you've already had a few, it doesn't really matter!

Every town needs a bar like the Trop.",2
17061,2,1546905600000,"Cafe Zupas is always a good ""go to"" but it can be a bit pricy. If you stick to the ""Try 2"" combo, you can save a couple bucks. I always get the full sandwich & half soup for $10 
All their ingredients seem fresh and they have a great variety of Soup, Salad & Sandwiches. A lot of items are Zupas originals, so they are one of a kind. My favorite sandwich is Honey Bacon Club with Red Lobster Bisque soup. 
It's always a full house during the lunch hour, so plan on a crowd and sometimes a wait. 
I would recommend this place, but go during an ""off"" hour. 
I'm only giving 3 starts due to the lack of seating during the busy hours. You are holding a tray full of food & hot soup trying to make your way through a maze of tables, if you can even find an empty table.",2

I'm also fascinated that they managed to install a wood-fired brick oven on a food truck.  Such a neat idea, and they executed it well.  With pizza, you worry about how long it will take to get an order out, but they can pump out pizzas quickly.  We used them for a kids party, and they were able to turn out 50+ pizzas in under an hour.  It was incredible.  We'd use them again in a heartbeat for a party.  They were very accommodating.  It was nice to have the guests get whatever they wanted without worrying about appeasing everyone with my topping choices.

The ingredients are quite good too.  The Neapolitan style dough is thin and crispy and delicious.  You may want to ask them to leave it in the oven a bit longer if you want it crispier.",2

She told us we had to wait another hour then later said she meant to tell us 15 minutes?! The first Asian girl who helped us was nice, but this tall brunette girl didn't let the Asian girl even answer us. We get it, you're busy or you don't have many tables open for service.

Another 15 minutes to get bread. Zzzzzzz...... But finally the service picked up and we all enjoyed our meal. 

PROS: ambiance, fresh bread, croque monsier!!, truffle pomme frites, beneigts!!, foie gras (i don't eat it but friends raved about it), and fresh squeezed OJ.

CONS: slow service, sort of rude hostess, skip the bread pudding French toast. They do not take reservations for lunch.",2

Beer menu,  slightly above par for similar venues in west valley.  Increased taps and better selection of true local craft news l brews would change things dramatically.  

Ambience,  nice blend of neighborhood bar meets comfy lounge.  

Service left much to be desired.  Bartender (female) working twice as hard as wait staff (also female) who were slow and moved without urgency.  Coaching needed here from management.

Go on Wednesday, the Tomatoe Basmati Rice soup is seriously heavenly. I gave this place four stars just because of it. They also have amazing pie and mozzarella sticks.

Called ahead for take out, arrived 15mins later as instructed and found they haven't even started with my order yet. The next customer in line actually got her order ahead of me. I asked the staff for an explanation and the staffs are very impatient. She kept saying how busy they were and they have to serve whoever comes to the store first. I understand that but if you can't make it in time just don't say you can make it in 10 to 15mins on the phone. This situation did not happen just once. I wish there were zero star as an option here.

That was a while ago, and justifiably their prices have gone up a little bit. 

Bring your old stuff, they will sift through it, hand some back and give you a credit slip for store goods for what they keep. Good deal for crap you just have collecting dust in your place anyway.

They just added a coffeehouse recently and I am impressed with the quality of all of their coffee. 

One gripe (and the reason this local AZ business doesn't get my 5th star) is that they use an out of state roaster for their coffee. 

The coffee is good, but there are many many talented roasters here in the CenPho area who would be more than grateful to get a piece of that AZ pie too. Just food for thought since Bookman's was founded, and thrives due to AZ cash, maybe spread the love to other AZ businesses.

17132,1,1547251200000,"While the food was really great, the service was deplorable! After being seated for at least 10 minutes we finally flagged someone down to take our drink order.  It wasnt for lack of wait staff because the two tables next to ours seemed to get plenty of attention. In fact, one of those tables was seated after us and they received their food before we even got our drinks!
This poor service continued throughout, no one checking for drink refills or to see if we needed anything else.  Meanwhile that table that got served before us (same number of people at the table) finished and was out the door about 15 minutes before us.  The only negative on the food was that I got a scramble with a side of roasted potatoes not knowing that the scramble included hashbrowns. The roasted potatoes were outstanding whereas the hashbrowns were old, fried, and very greasy. What a shame! Ask to sub roasted potatoes for hashbrowns. You wont be disappointed.",2

Just a word of warning, the spicy chicken is REALLY spicy. I didn't try any, but the friends I were with were chugging water like there was no tomorrow, and they have a normal tolerance for spice (certainly not the Korean tolerance though!)

Steak wrap is also top notch with a side of gluten free mac and cheese. I like they have real silverware ground pepper shakers and of course siracha.

People who work there are friendly and good at helping if you need something. This place reminds me of fast casual places all over Los Angeles like Lemonade or Veggie Grill or Urban Plates in San Diego.

Negatives would be slightly pricey esp if you get a lemonade or cookie with your entree it will be over 20 bucks per person. Also food times is semi-inconsistent sometimes it comes out fast sometimes takes forever. I've seen this when the place is full or empty, but the food is fresh.

17204,1,1547596800000,"Ticoz is a trendy-ish restaurant/bar (hence ""resto-bar""; one half is a bar/lounge while the other half is a conventional dining room) on 7th Street just north of Camelback. Like several of the bars and restaurants in this area, it's popular with the LGBT community though it's certainly straight-friendly.

We went for Taco Tuesday at happy hour. Unlike many other ""happy hours"" there are real deals on the food and drink. Taco Tuesday means the street tacos are $2 each. Also unlike other places, their street tacos are not skimpily-portioned. I highly recommend getting a plate of four or all five that are on offer. My favorite was the Tinga Chicken taco; it's basically BBQ shredded chicken. 2nd favorite was the Dos Equis XX batter-fried tilapia taco. It comes with two pieces of fried tilapia, crispy not oily, sauce and cabbage. Both I and one of my dining companions had to remove one of the tilapia pieces because it was just too much to try to fit in the mouth. The other two chosen were the carne asada and pork adobada. Frankly these were just OK and did not measure up to the first two; however, once again the portions were generous. I did not try the vegetarian street taco. Nobody was able to eat any more food after having four street tacos each and splitting two bowls of chips between the four of us.

The chips and salsa is charged for; it's $1.50 each. The chips are large and seem to come out of a bag. The salsa is good and plenty spicy but I just did not care for the chips and wouldn't order them again.

During happy hour the drink deals are half off for draft beers and specialty mojito/margarita/sangria. $2.50 for a draft Blue Moon or Dos Equis Amber is a pretty good deal, I'd say. The other drinks listed are $4 during happy hour. One of the dining companions tried the Passion Fruit Sangria, which I enjoyed. I tried a peach sangria that was disappointing; the peach flavor was barely there. I enjoyed much more the blood orange margarita.

The service is excellent here, super-friendly (especially the owner) and efficient. While waiting for friends to show up I sat in the lounge, which felt rather warm compared to the restaurant side where we ended up sitting. I have heard the weekend breakfast is really good and I look forward to trying it; $2.99 Bloody Marys, Mimosas, Screw Drivers, Greyhounds and Cape Cods and $9.95 for a variety of breakfast dishes, half of which have a strong Mexican influence.

Ticoz has been around for awhile and I understand why! I've been to several trendy restaurant/bars that overcharge for small portions and watered-down drinks. Ticoz delivers the goods and if you time your visit right, at a great price. Looking forward to my next visit here!",2

2) Walmart and Rona are directly across the street carrying most of the same products for 20-30% less without being on sale. 

3) poorly organized store. Unclear prices. Cat beds next to chainsaws didn't make too much sense. 

4) Flyer falsely advertises products on sale or has products not even available for purchase. 

All in all piss poor product and service for luxury prices. 
Not to mention the esso across the street also has cheaper gas. By 4 cents a liter.

I raved about it prior, but I spoke too soon.  The service was slow and inconsistent.  We both ordered the gyro sandwiches which it clearly states on the menu that it's $1.50 extra to add a soup or salad.  It already comes with fries.  I ordered the greek salad, but it was more like a village salad.  Not like before when it came with a great small greek salad with lettuce, tomatoes, olives and feta.  The pita bread is no longer hot pita bread, but cold dinner rolls.  The gyro was too salty and the yogurt sauce was a salt lick.  At the end of our meal, I was charged $7.00 for the salad.  After I pointed it out on the menu, nothing was done.  Our server just said I ordered incorrectly.  Huh?  My friend was charged $4.00 for his lemon soup instead of a $1.50.

17323,3,1546732800000,"I wouldn't call myself a steak snob but it would be fair to say that I am routinely... often... USUALLY disappointed with the steaks cooked anywhere other than my back yard coal fired grill. A good cut of beef is a thing to be honored and prepared with no small degree of reverence and most restaurants that call themselves steakhouses just are are not up to the task.  HOWEVER sometimes a steak is what is required and when on the road sometimes I have little choice but to interview the locals,  cross reference their suggestions with web reviews, calculate a weighted average based on linear progressions, and roll the dice... 

SNAKE EYES! Thats a good thing right? Nevermind that, this place has great steaks! I ordered the Baseball Cut Sirloin which, according to the menu, is only served rare or medium rare(a great sign as far as my reverence detector is concerned.) I ordered rare, it came somewhere between rare and medium rare (just right for my taste but I dont want to be the 122-125 degree Fahrenheit or I send it back guy.) It was lean, tender juicy, flavorful, fabulous. But what really got to me, and the reason for 5 stars is the seasoning.

Most people probably dont spend two paragraphs praising the saltiness of a dish but I'm going to. The difference between bland food and food that dances on the tongue and excites the palette is often times... usually, the saltiness. Salt brings out all the other flavors and aromas and a perfectly salted and perfectly cooked steak is... a perfect steak. When Gordon Ramsey is screaming at people about seasoning and bland risotto this is what hes talking about. Salt. And at the Keg, not only was each bite of the outside of the steak well seasoned (which is expected but not always achieved at a high end steakhouse,) the inside was as perfectly seasoned as well! What magic is this!?

According to the bartender (who was delightful and recommended some solid nightlife for after dinner) the steaks are salted 12 hours in advance, in essence brining them. Instead of an extra salty crust that balances out a bland interior, every bite is perfect. Every nibble of every bite is perfect. 

I am always excited to learn a new technique and will soon be experimented with and hopefully implementing it at the Sushi Czar household (and I do hope that The Lovely and Talented Sushi Czarina will bear with me if I accidentally jerky, pickle, or otherwise dehydrate a few steaks.) 

If you're in the Toronto area looking for a top notch, possibly life changing steak experience, do give The Keg a try... and its not expensive either.",2
17331,3,1548633600000,"We've been here twice now and both times were very pleasant. You have to get the pretzel fondue - its amazing. It is basically what you always dreamed of when ordering a pretzel and cheese sauce at the ball park - only this time the cheese dip is amazing and flavorful and the pretzel is moist and perfectly warm. For dinner we had the crab stuffed chicken which was very good and the Bolognese with Ricotta Dumplings. This dish was amazingly good - unfortunately it had been removed from the menu for some reason by the time we got back for our second visit. 

The second visit was to kill an hour before taking friends to the airport. We got an assortment of beers and appetizers - all were good especially the rock shrimp, the bacon and cheese stuffed potato bites (not the real name) and of course the pretzel fondue again. We sat on the patio and the open atmosphere was great. Highly recommend as a change from the usual fare.",3
17336,3,1548720000000,"I have never been to The Center, and I wish I had had the time to look around a little more. The lobby area - where you will find the Bronze Cafe - has the feel of an open library, with some computers available for use against one wall, and book shelves along a longer curved wall. I really liked the atmosphere, it made me feel like I was a little bit more cool just for having been there.

The counter guy was super friendly, and offered us a sample of their lentil soup with veggies. It was very flavorful, and actually light & refreshing, which is quite an accomplishment for a bean soup.

I really like roasted veggies, so I ordered The Good Earth, and I also got an ice-brewed coffee. The sandwich had lettuce, tomato, roasted? mushrooms, roasted eggplant, alfalfa sprouts, an orange dressing of some kind, sunflower seeds, and what tasted like candied walnuts. I love eggplant, but it really wan't cooked well enough. Cooked eggplant is kind of mushy (and delicious!), but this was still pretty firm & spongy, like it was pretty raw. All the other ingredients were fantastic, and even the candied walnuts went surprisingly well with the other ingredients. But for a roasted veggie sandwich, I also would have liked to see something other than just the eggplant & possibly mushrooms. (I am not sure if the mushrooms were actually roasted. I have not heard of such a thing, but otherwise the eggplant would have been the only roasted veggie.) The pita bread was delicious.

My friend had the Tree of Life, and she thought it was awesome.

I can't really judge the ice-brewed coffee, as I have never had it before. I had heard it was much less bitter than heat-brewed coffee and so I really wanted to try it. But it pretty much just tasted like iced coffee but not as watered down. It could be the most phenomenal ice-brewed coffee ever, but it was my first taste so I can't compare it. Personally, I will stick with regular coffee in the future.

Weird, right? I didn't like my sandwich or my drink, but I still gave it four stars. I liked the atmosphere and the service, and I just feel like I happened to order the wrong thing for me. I feel confident the next visit will be a five-star experience.

We had a late check-in as we noted on our reservation.  They charged our card as a deposit.  When we showed up at the Palms to check in we were told that the hotel overbooked, but they would comp us a room over at Ceasar's Palace.  Kind of irritating but not the end of the world.  We were told to call the next morning around 11 and they would let us know what rooms we would be in.  We called and were told that they were not  ready and they would call us when they were.  Check out at Ceasar's had passed so now we had to ride back over to the Palms, so they could hold our bags until the room was ready.  We went back to the strip to play around.  Time passed and by 8:00 that night the rooms we still had not received a call.  We called and were told that AGAIN they overbooked and did not have any rooms for us.  They would upgrade us to a suite, it would not be ready for a few hours, but they would call us.  We continued to have fun on the strip and made it back to the Palms at about 1:30am in the morning.  After explaining the situation to another clerk in the lobby (they had no record of the issues) we finally were able to get a room.

It isn't fancy, they didn't waste a bunch of money on making it look pretty, they just cook great food, everyday.  

I recommend the carnitas, either the plain or the red or the green.  Beware on the red however, it is spicy, it will creep up on you, it is basically their pork tips slow simmered in a spicy chipotle sauce.  They serve it with either corn or flour tortillas, with rice and beans and all the good stuff to make little tacos out of your platter.

I read on here that their portions aren't big.  Which is true, they are a normal size portion, which is smart, generally there is a lot of wasted rice and beans at a restaurant like this.  Personally I love the portion size, it is just enough to fill me and I don't feel stuffed like a relleno afterwards.

The burritos area great, but it's a burrito, you can get that anywhere, try something different when you are at an authentic place.  As for the bar, not too many options, but I'm usually busy drinking salsa at this place.

Just phenomenal.  It's that place where I can look at my wife and say ""I'm craving..."" and she will answer ""Taqueria.""

First of all the service is terribly slow. You're lucky if you get a drink refill. The tacos, like I said, were good, but good luck getting the ones you ordered or with the proper toppings. I got completely different tacos than I ordered and my co-worker got a taco with avocado in it which he told the server he couldn't eat because he was allergic. When the waitress brought the taco up to the cook and told him about the mess up with the avocado we saw him laughing about it behind the counter.

Buzz has been good early and since all of the items are made fresh from scratch sometimes things run out.  However, we were still able to get a good sense of the place and definitely think we will be back.

We started off with the fried pickles.  They were in the chips and not the spears which isn't always my favorite but you can tell they were from a big bag of frozen items.

I went with two lbs of wings with their traditional Bobby Q sauce and another called Vampire's Kryptonite.  The traditional was very tasty, I wouldn't mind having a bottle of it at home.  The VK was a garlic and oil sauce which was not bad by any means but not for me.

The wife went with the chicken and waffles.  They were out of fried chicken but substituted the chicken tenders.  I will say these were some of the best chicken tenders I've had.  It's abundantly clear that the chicken is high quality and they are made fresh.  The waffles were also great and the cayenne syrup was a great topping.

The menu was set to change the next day actually so we will have to go back and try some of the old items that weren't available as well as some of the new.

The pizza tasted worse than a 5 dollar frozen pizza you'd get at the store, the sushi had no flavor, the meatloaf looked like something that was thawed out last week! 
Overall bad, didn't even try the dessert.",2
17454,1,1546732800000,"We used to be regulars here and came every weekend with my wife, mom and in law.
Service used to be very good and the food was great, especially for the price. But this was when the restaurant has just opened and for a couple years.
We stopped going there because prices were increased and service and quality has slipped quite abruptly.
We gave it another chance and came back to check if things got any better: we were disappointed again.
Price has gone up again, we were charged some ""weekend"" fare, service was less than cordial (not even a ""hello"" or ""good morning"" before we were led to the table) and the food was average at best.
The chicken and broccoli was bland, the spicy salmon rolls were rich in mayonnaise and the rice was on the uncooked side.
Unfortunately they have literally ran this place down to abandonment.
The first impression is the broken floor tiles right outside the front door, waiting for someone to slip when wet, or to trip on the cracks.
I hope they do something about the facilities and training of staff. 
I won't go back.
Good luck.",2
17455,1,1548806400000,"This place was a very last minute find, because we were STARVING, but it was so nice inside! We were looking for somewhere somewhat sophisticated, and this was just perfect. The walls are painted as if you are walking the streets of Italy, with flowers in the windows and cobblestone roads. Our server was a little interesting..but entertaining. He pulled out his chair and sat down at our table to take our orders...HA! But he definitely knew his stuff.. he didn't write anything down and all of it was correct to the T. 

The food was alright, nothing too fancy. I had veal marsala and it could have had a little more shabang to it... But still a good meal. The carbonara was amazing though (once again...sharing plates...)!! Although that dish is usually always a winner... 

This place would be great for a hot date, intimate family meal (not great for little kids though), or just good friends. And prices are pretty reasonable for the fairly elegant setting.",2

17462,3,1548460800000,"The Public House is one of those perfectly acceptable West Park pubs. Nothing about it is either exceptionally good nor exceptionally poor. They've made some improvements in the several decades that I've been intermittently visiting, first as a neighborhood resident and then as a holiday visitor. The bar in the middle of the floor, for example, that was once so stupidly big that it took up 60% of the floor area, has been reduced so that people can actually walk by one another on the outskirts. There's a fair amount of seating, a tolerable beer selection (macro-swill, Guinness, and maybe some Great Lakes), okay prices, and a crowd that isn't nearly as douche-heavy as West Park Station a few doors down. I've never done the food, so I can't speak to that. There's a jukebox with a decent selection of the usual Irish punk West Park bars specialize in.

So, if you want to see your former teachers from Our Lady of the Angels drinking by day and the current crop of neighborhood kids who've turned legal by night, this is a perfectly alright place for a pint and a shot. It's not divey enough for ironic hipster slumming nor upscale or memorable enough to make it a destination, but as a place to whet your whistle on the way elsewhere or a last call destination on the stumble home, Public House will get the job done for you. In a weird way, it's my archetype for the three-star review. It's not as if it's a three star mean score, an establishment that does some things well and others badly, but rather a place that is uniformly solid but unspectacular. It's hard to imagine either loving or hating it.",2

I do love you and I love the ease that you offer me after a long day at work.  I can quickly run in, get my milk, a loaf of fresh French bread, some quick produce for tomorrow's lunch bag, and sometimes I'll even get a pre-prepared, preservative free entrée for dinner.  You make it quick and painless and I don't have to walk the length of 3 football fields from one end of the store to the other to hit the dairy, produce, baked goods and meat section.  

Another thing I love about you is that you don't clutter up the aesthetics of the store, or add another hassle to my shopping experience by cleverly stationing racks of impulse buys at the check out prompting my son to beg for various sugary delights.  

And the final thing I will miss is your mark down area.  While I have found that some items are still priced too high to be a real deal, the only place you lose a star, I've still scored amazing deals on fresh seafood, steaks, bakery items and so forth.  I will certainly miss that too.  

Tesco, please reconsider shutting down these stores, there has to be a way to make this business model work.  I'm not sure what that missing secret to your business success is, but I certainly feel that Fresh and Easy is a pleasant enough shopping experience that there has to be some way to turn other shoppers onto it too.",2

My wife and i were celebrating our 1yr anniversary and we wanted to go overseas (but the flights and weather didn't permit) so we looked for something stateside close to home and we came across this place.  Thank god we did. Everyone was extremely nice and they were ON POINT with everything. Within an hour they remebered our names and faces. When we booked the room, they asked us what the occasion wad and we told them. They had complimentary champagne and chocolates for us, a welcome/congratulations card (personalized), and little welcome box with in house made chocolate,  granola bar, and carmel. We also took our cake and a bottle of champagne to celebrate and they held it in their house fridge for us and and delivered it to the room when we asked. Boris, Steve, Cody, Damien, Lorett, and Kayla went above and beyond every single time. I know we won't forget them.  Besides the gorgeous property, they are the ones that helped make our stay memorable and helped convince us to come back (the 24hr pools and hot tubs play a big role in it too haha).",2

They don't make their own noodles but all - in - all this is the best place I've tried for ramen so far, North of Major Mac. :)

I think that the average rating showing up on Yelp should be higher for this place.  It looks to me like the ratings bounce between 2 and 4 stars.. given the location, given the ease and speed at which we ordered and were served.. given that imagine cinemas is just around the corner and we made it in time for our movie.  But especially given they actually have a dessert selection - which is something I don't see often. 4 stars!  I'd give 5 if the noodles were made in-house.

The place was pretty much dead with it raining  &  but the service is very consistent with what I'm accustomed to having had SK in let's say 5 states. I ordered my normal Strawberry Hulk without ice cream with Greek yogurt it's heaven in a cup with a straw.

Both drinks pleased our palette perfectly.  For dinner I had the mushroom tacos (being a vegetarian that was the go to option) and my husband had the al pastor tacos - simply put, amazing.

Thirdly, after an hour waiting for our bags to arrive they never did until we had to go back down and ask for them AGAIN. When they finally delivered our belongings, I noticed that my pillow case was all torn up and the man literally just rolled his eyes and left. And the worst part was, around 8am the next day, when we were all sleeping someone opened our room without knocking, peeked in and left ( we had no idea who it was).

The dinner however left a bit to be desired.  I mean, they used tortilla chips from Safeway, and couldn't substitute their pinto beans for black beans.  What kind of Latin restaurant is this??  

Also, the chicken torta was extremely greasy and gave me the burps the rest of the night.  And I'm not one with a sensitive stomach so it caught me by surprise.

As for the food, it wasn't particularly memorable, but I would give it another shot, seeing as I only ordered their average burger, thinking it would taste ""beer-ish"".

The dessert selection is huge - you're bound to find something you like there. I especially liked the mini waffles and the blueberry cheesecake. 

There is pretty much no service - other than to clear your plates. You get your own drinks etc. I don't appreciate how prices are raised for the holidays ($27.99 per adult on a weeknight, hard to justify for mediocre quality food) because it's not like their costs are changing! That being said, this place was still packed on a Wednesday.

My one complaint is that they didn't have the honey wine that I've had at other places. They did have two types of Ethiopian beer, though, so that was good.

I actually enjoyed my meal BUT when my friend recieved her's, it is not baked! We called the waiter and told him, he said it is, no- it's boiled! I'm used to baked in the oven and it having a golden top bubbling. It was terrible! Disappointing! The service was a okay... I think I would just go back and try cocktails and not make it a place to dine.",2

Free WiFi is always nice as well.",3

17662,2,1546473600000,"Pisces is quickly becoming a go-to for sushi in Charlotte. I went once for their all-you-can-eat lunch, and then again last night for dinner. Both times I thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience! Lunch was super busy, but thankfully we were seated in a cute little pod/booth off to the right of the main dining room that was much calmer. The waitress was quick, efficient, and accurate- which speaks volumes because the place was packed and orders were coming in left and right. The rolls for AYCE lunch come in half sizes and are simpler than the regular menu, but they have a nice variety to pick from- my fave was the spicy salmon roll. We also ordered spring rolls, which were tasty, and pork gyoza dumplings, which I loved. The fried rice was okay, but I preferred to save room for sushi :) A tip for lunch: order double rolls and pick maybe 3-4 at a time. They go pretty quickly and it'll prevent you from having to make a bunch of smaller orders. Dinner was really different- the restaurant was much quieter and we were seated in the main dining area. We ordered seven rolls- the XOXO, the Panther, the Spider, the Spicy Tuna, a bagel roll, a California roll, and Like A Vegan. Everything was so fresh and tasty. My favorite was probably the Spicy Tuna, but they were all delicious. I had a cosmo and my date ordered a LIT. They make all their drinks from scratch and my cocktail was head and shoulders above any other cosmo I've had. Usually the cranberry is too overpowering. He was satisfied with his LIT as well. I'd totally come back here for either a casual lunch or cute date night!",2

The employees have a sense of urgency that was not experienced in the past. They seem like they are truly working hard to provide the best customer experience. There is no more slow moving lines with uninterested employees talking and not paying attention. 

This chipotle is now more fitting of what I expect based on experience with other locations. The only thing I think still needs work is keeping up with the demand. There are still times where things like veggies are unavailable because more have not been made until they are completely out. Fixing that and making more in anticipation of the rush would give them that final star from me. 

But all around I am much more pleased than any of my past experiences with this location.",2

My son and I finally came here and ordered the Organic Roasted Vegetable Bowl with Chicken, one of each of their tacos and a nachos grande. The bowl was very intense with a every bite a complexity of flavors. The tacos had me torn, I could not place a favorite due to the fact they're each unique in flavors. As for the nachos, a must have. Finally, an amazing staff that assured you're welcomed from the time you walk until the time you leave. I give credit to the manager and to his team. I had to come back and bring my better half to experience this place, and of course, she loved it! Oh, by the way, They have a bar with a TV. With a selection of beers and both red and white sangria that is made fresh. And must I mention the freshly made salsa bar with a 'to die for' guacamole salsa.

I showed up to sip on a cocktail while waiting for a friend to fly into Sky Harbor (a little far away but i'm currently living in Tucson so I was not too concerned with time) 

So, it's Friday.....it's 5 pm and it's Scottsdale, perfect recipe for happy hour right? 

Wrong.... The place was abandoned, the only people there were me, a fellow who looked way too old and golf resort to be at the Mondrian and a male couple outside with that ""oh so charming"" yappy small dog that everyone hates except the owner. 

6 Bucks for a beer (I know, I know....) One should be sipping on a Martini  here but when I saw the ambiance I just wanted to get the hell outta there as fast as I had showed up.

17675,2,1546300800000,"I'm not a picky person when it comes to hotels. I'd much rather spend my money on food, drink and activities than on an upscale hotel. That said, heres my Pros and Cons.

PROS:
  * Although not on The Strip, the Monorail made getting there fast & convenient!
  * Had some issues with CC charges after my stay and the operator was very nice!
  * Good value for a hotel in Vegas
  * Clean lobby and casino floor (although did see 1 huge roach crawling up a wall)
  * Beds were comfy and theres a flatscreen TV.

CONS:
  * Rude staff!! If you hate working there, LEAVE?!  From the front desk to the bars and restaurants, no one is friendly.  There is an exception as we visited the front desk and I wish I got his name, he was VERY friendly and helpful.  

  * Rooms are dated and need sprucing up.
  * No hot water the first morning...luke warm the next.
  * The coffee in your room is NOT complimentary.  Watch out...$4 for a K cup of watered down, weak coffee. 
  * Bathrooms need major cleaning as one room in our group had rusted out areas and mildew along the caulking.  Duct tape holding up lighting.
   *Benny Binion would be disappointed that they don't follow his vision of free cocktails while playing slots...only for table gamers.

In all, this hotel is ok for the price.  If you can look past the rude staff and dingy guest room bathrooms, it will save you some $$ to eat, drink and play on The Strip.",3
17679,1,1547164800000,"At first, I was hesitant to come, as I went to a Brazilian steak house in Vancouver (Samba) and felt that it wasn't a good value, nor was the ambiance or food very good.

WELL I was shown very differently here!  I came with a birthday party of 15 people and we were treated extremely well even with all the commotion of an extremely packed saturday night!  Live sexy belly dancers that perform regularly and roam the restaurant, Capoeira dancers and a live band make the night lively and entertaining enough!  But the servers traveling around with the DELICIOUS cuts of meat were great :)

I ate so much I pretty much had the meat sweats afterwards.  There were over 10 different types of meats including (but not limited to) suckling pig, bacon wrapped filet mignon, beef and pork ribs, moroccan chicken, and then there was the toasted pineapple with a dusting of cinnamon to cleanse the palate.  Even the 'salad' bar was really great!  It was approximately $42 a head (it's only all you can eat, so if you don't want that, don't come here), so after tax and tip for a large group you're looking at $53 a person before drinks.  Not for the light wallet, but if you're looking to put yourself in a meat coma, this is the place to do it.",1

     Beverage selection-awesome. (one word, Cheerwine)  Hospitality-awesome.  Ambiance-awesome.  Price-awesome.
     We had biscuits, an appetizer, an entree, a po' boy (with homemade chips) and a speciality soda.  Total check with tax was $42 bucks.  
     The shrimp and cheesy grits were delicious.  The low country boil was good too.  My po' boy was flavorful but my bread was a little soggy, had they toasted it, it would have been perfect. (-1/2 star) Their homemade hot sauce is killer.  I'm a hot sauce fanatic and theirs might be my new all time favorite.  The biscuits were exactly what you want from a biscuit if you've ever lived in the south, and they are served with jam and butter.  Just that little thing made my absolute day.  
     You'll be glad you went and so will whomever you bring with you.

We spent most of our time listening to some regulars burp loudly at the bar and the waitress bragging that she had all her teeth.  The fries were precut and frozen and the pimento cheese on my burger seemed like more grease than cheese.

17746,1,1547683200000,"A few weeks ago, I had Sunday brunch at The Perch. The restaurant is presumably so named because it is perched on the second story overlooking Container Park. Befitting its location though, the entire restaurant seemed like more of an idea than a thing of substance.

The restaurant has communal seating of the type one might expect at a southern German beer garden. Unlike the sturdy tables at the beer garden, ours had a mossy ditch running down the center which caused another patron to upset her mimosa right onto my friend's lap.

We started off sharing some monkey bread, which was the best monkey bread I ever had - moist, saucy & delicious. The menu is rather limited and the prices won't set you back much. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for. Because they had no eggs Benedict, I had to break my streak of reviewing the eggs Benedict everywhere I go, and I ordered a burger instead. The vegan in our party tried to order a fruit plate, just to find out they were ""out of fruit plates,"" and Mark tried to order the steak & eggs, only to find out that the steak could only be cooked well done.

I suspect that the fiasco that was my burger was the product of poor quality ingredients, sloppiness & probably some witless ideas. The burger comes with maple bacon, something that aspires to Emmentaler cheese, and a fried green tomato that hadn't a single hoot left to give. It was supposed to come with chipotle mayonnaise, but was in fact served in a state of undress, so I used my friend's garlic aioli instead. The garlic aioli and maple bacon disagreed with each other, but I'd be willing to bet that combining the maple bacon with chipotle mayonnaise would not be much better a plan. The burger wasn't seasoned properly, if at all, and the fried green tomato tasted like the flavorless fried cornmeal mush that is so popular in Appalachia. The fries were decent, as was the service.

Overall, I have to conclude that The Perch is not worth the trip.",1

I hope you are well and its not because are in the hospital in a coma and was unable to communicate. if it is such that you are well then in the future you need to consider that the staff gets up early in the morning to be here for you! Potential clients who could have had your appointment slot were denied the chance to get their hair done.

I like this place because it's only 8 miles off the strip, and it really feels like you're on vacation. 

I really wanted to give GVR five stars, but I just couldn't because the shower pressure totally sucked. I called and they sent engineering right away. He said he couldn't do much because the water-saving shower heads were like that. So change the heads! 

Beds were nice, room was comfortable and the pool was really big, with separate pools for adults, and a long lounge-like one up top by the cabanas. I have no idea if you had to reserve those or not, but we had gone up there to just hang out since it was quieter.

Highly recommend; got it on Hotwire for a great rate.",3
17816,1,1548115200000,"I attended this Milestones today for lunch and even though the food was good, I experienced really mediocre and almost don't care attitude in their service. 

First of all the restaurant was less than half full. We were a group of 10 individuals and probably the only group that had this many people. But it took almost 30 minutes from the time we ordered and got out food. Lunch times are when everyone wants to eat as fast as possible and get back to their desks but I don't think the restaurants didn't have any interest in serving as quickly as possible.

2nd of all, my friend ordered a salad and mentioned that hes allergic to nuts and to remove it from the item. A waitress (not our initial waiter) brought the food to all of us and placed the salad that my friend ordered in front of him with some nut like garnish on top of it. When my friend asked what it was she almost casually said that ""those can be pine nuts"". Then she almost ran away when we had to call her back (at this point she seemed a bit annoyed) and when we mentioned that we said no nuts, she was like ""your waiter should have taken care of it"" in an almost disregarding manner. Then when we inquired our waiter about the garnish he mentioned ""yeah it doesn't have nuts but if you want you don't need to eat it"". This is NOT how service should be done! Nut allergies can kill people and I cannot believe the waitress had such an attitude towards it. This is totally unacceptable.

Lastly, immediately after our food was placed on the table, the waiter asks us how the food tastes and I am going ""can you let us eat first?"" ( i didn't mention it to him but whats up with this?)

Overall not a pleasant experience. Probably attests to the fact of why the restaurant was less than half full while the Jack Astors etc right opposite seems to have a good flow of customers.",2

My fiancee let me have a taste of the smoked sausage she had on her plate and it was of equal quality to everything else we had.

The pierogi come in so many different varieties and the plate meals are just the right amount of food.

17840,2,1546646400000,"Thomas Keller's Las Vegas version of Bouchon is pretty much that - a Las Vegas version of the Napa Valley eatery.  It's bright, massive and it's in a pretty swanky Las Vegas Hotel Casino.

The hostesses were a little spacey, (they seemed like trainees) but were very nice and we technically didn't run into any difficulties being seated.  They even dialed Pinot Brasserie so we could call and cancel our reservations.

Food wise, I was satisfied.  Four stars satisfied.  I think I'm a little harder on my restaurant scoring because I've dined at a lot of places in Asia and America so I've got a pretty good idea of fabulous dining.

Although my party did not sample the much hyped raw shellfish selections, I did take time to notice the prep and display area.  A large sushi kitchen circular glass case with two (I think) sous chefs working away.

Given my critical rating, these four stars are well earned.  Our server was quirky but knowledgeable.  Our sommalier was friendly and very helpful - pretentious is not a word I would use for any part of this experience, even though the service and presentation was nearly first class.

An old french favorite of mine has always been French onion soup.  Yup, old reliable.  As commonplace as [it] can be, I've definitely has my fair share of screwed up FOS.  Bouchon does not screw this up.  Both of the required cheeses were adequately layered and baked on top.  The broth was salty but not moisture drenching and there was the perfect amount of breading.

This review is for a dining experience exactly one week ago and my entree is a little fuzzy (I'm sick right now).  I do remember that I definitely wanted chicken but they definitely didn't have a sauce compatible with my allergen list.  The waiter switched the sauce and used the duck sauce which worked out quite well and my fuzzy memory is one of happiness and content.  Although salads should be bullet proof, they  too can be weak or ruined and I remember being impressed with the ingredients and presentation.

As a wrap up, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone that is looking for a reliable fine dining establishment away from the noise and the crush of the Venetian restaurant row or for anyone on a mission to sample the establishments of America's finest chefs across America.  Bouchon Las Vegas will not let you down.",2
17841,1,1547683200000,"When a fellow foodie friend of mine (say that three times fast) informed me this was either his favorite or second favorite restaurant in town I knew I had to try it. When I was able to get reservations for that night (granted it was a Thursday) I figured it was fate and I had to stop by. I'm so very glad I did.

We arrived right on time for our reservation and were seated promptly. The waiter stopped by, took cocktail orders, dropped off some bruschetta, and left us with the oil board menu which is entirely in Italian. After staring at it for a good few minutes and taking pride in being able to identify a small handful of the items, the waiter came back to explain what it was we were reading.

We started with the caprese, which was done up very simply and exactly how I wanted it - fresh and not overly elaborate. For my main I tried the pork osso bucco. If you know anything about me it's probably that I love osso bucco; if I see it on the menu I'm ordering it. This was probably the most unique osso bucco I'd ever had. It had a sauce that was white wine based as opposed to red, and had a flavor that I wasn't expecting. Don't get me wrong - it was awesome, but just off center. My wife went for the veal meatballs, which were melt-in-your-mouth amazing but not in the least bit brittle. The one thing I didn't care too much for was the fact that the pasta that was served with everything seemed like more of an afterthought than anything. Granted with my dish it didn't matter too much, but it would have been nice to have had some great pasta to go with the meatballs.

After we were finished dining our service took a severe turn for the worse. We weren't able to flag down our waiter for a good 10 minutes after finishing our meals. Not to be deterred, we still went with dessert (wasn't going to let that affect our meal), and we tried the tiramisu. Simply outstanding.

I'd love to go back, and I'm sure this is a 5 star place. But the server disappearing for a solid 10 minutes and the pasta really do knock this place down one notch. But even still, my recommendation is still this - go! Enjoy!",2

17854,3,1547510400000,"During my college years in Wisconsin, I became accustomed to lots of foods with cheese.  If you're from the Midwest, you know what I mean.  Approximately 2 years ago I discovered The Badger Café on Tropicana and Spencer.  Although I can't go there on Sundays during the football season as I'm a Chicago Bears fan and the establishment there is ""Packer Heaven,"" I don't discriminate any other day for a good meal.  From their daily specials to their wide variety of regular menu items, the food is outstanding and reasonably priced.  Everything from their pot roast to their Friday fish fry to the breakfasts served 24 hours a day, the food is top quality and the portions are large. Also, a special mention to try their 1/2 lb. burgers and the chicken wings with a variety of flavors, I highly recommend Rum Runners for anytime, day or night.  

Rum Rummer's bar is attached to the restaurant where you can order your meal, play a game of pool, darts or watch the sports on TV, and they'll serve your meal to eat in the bar area.  The bar staff is very friendly and most accommodating.

I take it they changed their gift certificates because I was questioned about the one that I had.  I stood my ground and told them what it was.  He told me that the certificate was not his.  I told him how I received it and that he just lost a customer. If you have a gift certificate please beware.  Owners attitude was uncalled for.

17888,1,1546992000000,"The Good: The Bacon Cheeseburger

The Bad: The futuristic Battlestar Galactica soda machine that dispensed diet coke that had hints of cherry, dr. pepper and sprite in it. It was like an old ""suicide"" drink.....except the machine actually chooses the flavors for you and it tastes like hell.

The Ugly: $12.54 for a burger, fries (which could have fed a village) and a coke. I understand that their better ingredients would warrant a higher price and I actually didn't mind paying that price until after I was done.

Back to the fries for a minute....the fries were pretty good, not great. I do not complain often about having too much food but the size of the order of fries for one person is just plain stupid. More than half ended up in the trash. 

My recommendation would be to go with another person and split a burger and fries......and drink tea or water so you do not have to deal with the T-1000 super duper drink dispenser.",2
17888,2,1547424000000,"I hate to give this place 3 stars because I'm sure if I had been there at another time, things would have been different.
This is NOT a place you want to go have dinner at on a Saturday night. It's SO loud that the resulting tinnitus lasts well into the following day.
Also theres a sizable drunk crowd (I understand a drunk crowd at a bar on a Saturday night, but at 7pm?). I would hate to know what those sweaty, wasted people look like at midnight.

The food, however is of high quality and decent prices. We were also well served by our waitress, even though she had dozens of patrons to serve. 
By the time we left the place had more of a nightclub feel (9pm), with mostly an older crowd. I don't have anything against nightclubs, but there's a time and a place ya know?

The peach ale is excellent, and the chicken skewers are an amazing value for money.

17893,1,1547424000000,"I felt compelled to write a review on My Resort after researching this place trying to decide if I wanted to try it. I couldn't find any real information to understand what it was really about, even their website only offers limited information. You will either dig this place or you won't. I went with a friend and we had the exact same treatments, the same day, but had very different experiences. I really enjoyed it but she didn't care for the ""automation"" of it all. Your experience here, like most things, will probably depend on what you are expecting. 

They have very friendly staff. Tina has been there each time I went and she is so personable and helpful, very sweet. 

It is located in a strip mall that looks a bit run down. I never would have thought to visit this place if I was just doing a drive by and choosing based on curb appeal. Once you are inside it has cute decor. There are private rooms for each of the ""automated"" services. 
- Hydromassage. You lay fully clothed on a bed with a screen where you control the pressure, zones and speed of the water jets. I really played with it a lot and found a perfect combination for blissful relaxation. IF you like those types of things. My friend was not a fan, she prefers regular hands on massages, she thought it was odd. It was about 15 minutes long. 
- Lumiere Facial- they give you facial products (which you have to purchase). You wash your face in the bathroom and then apply a serum. Then they set you up in a comfy massage chair, put goggles on you and put a big ""screen"" of lights in front of your face. My friend said the the bright lights were painful to her eyes and quit the session after a minute (she wears contacts so maybe that made her sensitive?). It reminded me of sitting in the sun without sunglasses in the summer. My face got very warm and all in all it was very relaxing. I saw a few stars afterwards like when you have a flash picture taken. I did the Repairing facial; I noticed right away that my face seemed ""rosier"" (this is not a tanning session) and my skin texture overall seems improved. I am a fan and I have been back for 2 more sessions. Lasts 20 minutes. 
- Hydrating steam pod - this was interesting. You strip down and hop into a pod that heats up to 118* i think they fill the steamer up with some hydrating concoction. Your head sticks out and you can supposedly control the heat on the control screen although neither me or my friend could get it to go down when we felt too hot. I love super hot baths/showers so i enjoyed it. My friend felt claustrophobic. it was about 20 minutes. I would not pay the per use charge to use this again. Just seems high for what it is. 

They also have a tanning bed (I never tan because tanning ruins your skin and prematurely ages you!!) and a sunless spray tan machine that I will try one day. 

The monthly package is a reasonable enough cost for me to give it a shot. I'm trying for 6 months. What makes it a deal is you can go in as much as you like and get whatever services you want (based on availability). You have to pay like $5 extra when you spray tan. Overall, I highly recommend this place if you are like me and into these types of treatments!",1

The dining area is nice and even has a small fountain show that runs about every hour. We looked at the menu and after a few suggestions from one of the waiters we ordered. Our salads came out quickly and had plenty of time to enjoy them before our meals came out.

Kudos to Saryo for introducing me to hojicha - roasted matcha that has a deeper, more complex earthy flavour than regular matcha. I think I love it even more than matcha!  

The hojicha ice cream sundae was very good - I absolutely loved the ice cream! I liked the contrast of almost every ingredient in that sundae against the hojicha - the matcha cake bites, red bean, mochi and granola were all very good. Not too keen on the jelly, since I personally thought that it added a weird texture with the ice cream but that's just me. Price-wise, the sundae was a bit steep - I paid a little over $8 with tax and the sundae was in a medium sized cup (about the size of a grande cup from Starbucks). Maybe increase the size of the serving to justify the slightly higher price? 

Staff were very friendly - they even let me sample some hojicha because I was a bit hesitant about the ice cream at first (smart move from them because I ended up falling in love at first bite!). 

I also like the fact that Hojicha is connected to a ramen shop, Konjiki - very convenient for everyone to get desserts afterwards!

I called out three Electrician's to my home. The first one wanted to charge me $3,000.00 -  plus any parts or supplies they used. The two man team then proceeded to tell me that I could get it done for half of that if I had them do it on the weekend. They did no repairs. That cost me $501.00 for the service call and for them to find the issue. They took off plate covers, checked the wires and put the covers back on. I noticed little connector caps all over the house and screws missing from the plate covers. I scheduled an appointment to have them do the repair two weeks out. I knew when I made the appointment that I would not let them in my home again. I have thought about reporting them to the Contractors Board and the BBB. They were criminal in my opinion.

The second company never showed up and never called. They called a week after they were supposed to be here and asked me if they could reschedule. 

The third one was 24/7. They came out at the time they said they would. The Gentleman that came out to do the work checked my sockets, put caps back on and rewired my attic where there was a cut line from the A/C theft. He was in my home for about an hour and the cost was about $200.00. I was ecstatic!

I need to mention that when I answered the door, he was actually early. He introduced himself and extended his hand for a handshake. He told me his name was Cruz, and told me of his  experience. He asked me what I needed done, then he walked through everything with me before he started the work. He was very neat and professional in appearance and disposition. Cruz was probably the best repair person I have ever had, and I am 60 years old. I was VERY SATISFIED with Cruz. I used to have a business of my own in Contracting, and I only wish that I could have found employees such as Cruz.

I had asked him if they did other things that were not all home building and repair. He replied that they did do various jobs. I need my cameras installed, some television sockets moved, under cabinet lighting and one outdoor project as well. I will have future business with 24/7. I was VERY Happy with 24/7 and Cruz. 

I used to have three different businesses throughout the years. One was a Maintenance and Painting business. I can do the work by myself, but I am a late stage Cancer survivor and I am not going to. Cruz is the Man, and I intend to contact 24/7 for ALL my Electrical Needs.  I Thank you very much for 'Letting There Be Light'!

I wish to extend a very well deserved Thank You to Cruz for doing such a Great, Inexpensive Repair to my home. I look forward to having a great relationship with 24/7 in the very near future and well beyond. 

I Like them, and they are HONEST! Thank you again 24/7! Cruz deserves a hefty raise. He watches your company as if it were his own. Man, Like I stated above, I wish I could have found employees like that!!!   

We hope to see you soon!!!",2
18047,3,1546300800000,"We checked in first time here at this location. Traveling through from NY to ND. The hotel at first seems good and descent, they definitely lack cleanliness. Our room could use a deep clean and some updating. 
Tiles, walls, inside of lamp shades all other areas your eyes catch. Front desk lady was friendly, didn't get our AAA discount when we asked for it. 
Only parking is out front and enter through main doors. Free WiFi
Pool and Breakfast. We'll see how everything else pans out. 
So far little overpaid for the room. I'm updating this. So after spending sometime in the room, my family and I noticed this room was pretty disgusting, seriously felt as if we could have caught something. Furniture had stains, tears and needed updating. Phones were covered with dirt, microwave was dirty all around it, we found PUKE next to the one bed as we pulled out the center stand, we smelled something funky. Dried vomit, was covered up. Mirror had toddler little kid handprints all over. Bathroom had dirt and grime in tile, caulking etc..... So we brought it up, took pictures the young girl working said well update to to bigger room and cleaner. I went down to front desk, showed her few pictures, she apologized, said yeah it happens with an attitude like oh well. Like she was use to this. So we go up to the upgraded room, put our bags down. We're exhausted had just driven from WNY, Buffalo, NY. All the furniture dirty and stained, tub had dirt, pull out couch sheets hadn't been changed and were disgusting! Also could see obvious signs of dirtiness! Just wasn't as bad as the first room. Breakfast wasn't anything special at all, nothing hot except waffle machine. Their eggs were hard boiled, the fitness center also was dirty the water machine had major dirt and water build up on the catch tray. The elliptical machine cover fell off as I was using it. Now if we've seen and noticed all this? Imagine what you can't see, pure gross and nasty! Hotels today need to do deep cleans, look everywhere, change out blankets with sheets. Provide better breakfast etc... definitely wasn't a good experience, waste of time and money! We'd like to see our money refunded, it was that bad! We complained at checkout to Manager, he seem to be upset with housekeeping. But didn't offer anything other then a sorry. I'd definitely NOT use this hotel!

We pulled into the drive thru, and were immediately greeted. Needed a minute to figure out the order and they waited patiently. Also made sure we were okay with waiting 6 minutes for the 3 chicken sandwiches we ordered, which we were. We pulled up and there were 3 young men working the window. They were moving quickly, smiling, and paying attention to what they were doing. We got our drinks and paid, and then I asked if I should move up since we were waiting and there were other cars behind us.

We waited about 3 minutes when one of the guys comes out and literally FLOURISHES our 3 bags of food at us. I mean, presentation AND style? At a fast food drive-thru at midnight? So cool.

18059,3,1546905600000,"I loved this place. 
I was in Chagrin Falls visiting my dear friend and she suggested Flipside. I am not a fan of burgers and fries and I try to avoid them like a plague. Burgers remind me of greasy, flavorless and characterless food one gets at gas stations. But my apprehension lasted but only on the drive to Flipside. As soon as I walked in through those doors, a flavorful aroma caught me by surprise. And like many others, I too scanned the plates of food being devoured by others. My eyes went straight for the gigantic pile of Onion Rings. They looked like no other onion rings I have ever seen. So obviously it was clear that I order them. Which I did. And they were AMAZING! They were beautifully spiced. (I love Spices, People!) They were crunchy, wholesome, non greasy deliciousness. 
Then came the star of the show! There are amazing Burger combinations - from your loyal beef burgers to new age salmon burgers. I went straight for the Lamb Burger with Mint Chutney. It was juicy, succulent meat with a bold mint sauce. Flipside does not hold back. And I love it. 
To wash it all down, I decided to try something unconventional and trendy - The Kombucha! The Unity Vibration Ginger Kombucha. Hmm... so for hardcore Beer lovers... be warned. You might not like this! It is too sweet. And it tasted like one of those drinks that your friends messed around with just to see your reaction. 
But for the adventurous and open hearted folk, try it. Once.

Like -  Place is clean, the pedi bowls are lined and the massage chairs are roomy.  I am a fan of the gel products they use. They have a pretty good variety of colors. Both Tina and Jenny are really friendly.

There's a Yelp checkin offer when you check in on the Yelp app.  They do charge a little more for some of the nail services and there's no reward card incentives like the other nail salon nearby. 

They are still in the midst of transforming the place ie. like covering the bare walls and replacing the old storefront sign that's still in place.

18117,1,1547856000000,"I normally do not eat in food courts when I am in a mall which is seldom unless I have to. I had learned about this rolled ice cream concept which I had previously experienced in Lawrenceville at Naturoll, and in Mt Lebanon and Squirrel Hill as 15 Fahrenheit, is now a staple in these malls.

My husband had never tried rolled ice cream and seeing the on par price tag of $7.49 I knew that once again I would have to splurge just so he could see what it was like.

There was only one man working when we arrived but later a couple of women came out to help. I decided to skip the build your own and go with the ready made concepts. My husband wanted a peanut butter vanilla with Reese pieces and a caramel topping. I decided to stick to my usual berry ice cream and have a strawberry topping.

Your name is written on your plastic cup and then you are ""called"" over when it is time to chip, chop, and roll your ice cream. I noticed the board they used is round and seemed smaller than the other two places I had visited previously. The man who worked with me was friendly and was blown away by the fact that I had been familiar with this concept for quite some time now. The only thing I did like was that I got 5 ""rolls"" rather than the traditional 4. He topped mine with some whipped cream and chocolate ""jimmies."" 

I started to eat this creation and to me it tasted thin and seemed to be store bought. My husband's seemed richer tasting but I'm not a big fan of peanut butter and caramel as he is. He did like it but later admitted to me he thought it was store bought as well.

The man explained to me that they also have a location in Ross Park Mall and one in Monroeville mall. Again, it is a novel approach and a delight for kids to watch your ice cream being made that way. However, that's what you are paying for and it does become expensive when you want to treat the family. For me however, nothing is better than home made ice cream.",2
18117,3,1546300800000,"Just Desserts is a dark and cozy spot....perfect for a date. Or if you're tagging along as the third wheel because you have a completely uncontrollable craving for dessert - which is what happened to me. 

Service was a little slow.. but our server was quite new and it was a Friday night so it was understandable. 

I started with one of their specialty coffees (with booze in it) which was good, minus the maraschino cherry in it (ew). After what literally felt like the hardest decision making process I've ever had to go through in my life (there's just SO MUCH CAKE!!), I finally  ordered a banana split with an embarrassing amount of toppings. The whole thing was exactly what I needed it to be: huge and unabashedly sweet. 

The menu is huge, the desserts are sweet. That's really what it boils down to. It's dark, as a few people have mentioned, but it makes things kinda sexy and doesn't make the sauce all over your face as obvious. BONUS.

The highlight for me - REAL strawberry ice cream. Not ice cream with gross fake strawberry flavouring.  In fact, next time I visit I'll probably end up ordering a huge bowl of just the strawberry ice cream with chocolate sauce.

We were met with rudeness, eye-rolling and abrupt responses from the front desk ladies. After waiting for 2 hours past check-in time in the hotel lobby and bar area....they said we could have a different room on a different floor and I explained that would not work because I needed to be next door to the bride to help her get ready because I'm her mother and the maid of honor was staying with me. Then the ladies told me that we would have to continue to wait then.  
I asked for the manager. His name is Dave I think. I explained the situation to him and he offered to take some off the price of the room and suddenly...our room was ready. Dave stepped in and made the situation ""right"".

She is a large dog weighing about 70 pounds but has never been any trouble on her many flights on American.  The only issue we have ever had while flying has been the unprofessional behavior shown to us by the ticket agent/baggage check in person at the Las Vegas Airport.  Upon seeing my Service Dog she went off about how many people try to bring dogs on the plane.  Dogs who are not really Service Dogs.  She explained to us that anyone could buy a vest like ours on ebay and call the dog a Service Dog.  We were just like all the others all trying to cheat the system.

I presented the shot records, the Health Certificate, the letter from my Doctor explaining I was deaf, and the harness with tags identifying she was a Service Dog.  The agent pulled another agent into this conversation asking her what else was needed so she could issue a ticket.  Her answer was it looked like I had everything in order.

18164,3,1547596800000,"This is a fun place to go. The owner bubbles with enthusiasm and will be very happy to discuss her dishes as much as you like. Our party of four had pig ears, chicken Algarve (thin chicken filet with cheese and mushrooms and spices, baked chicken, and chicken on a shish kabob; the first chicken dish and the pig ears were the best in terms of flavors. Unfortunately, they were out of the Portuguese Chorizo and we didn't try any of the more exotic dishes. Everyone liked everything. I plan to go back and try some of their seafood dishes. 

I notice reviews cover the spectrum on the Sangria. The owner asked us if we would like a liter of Sangria which is a tad more than quart. We're not big drinkers and we hesitated. The owner assured us it was a light drink; she said she just put a little port wine in and no Vodka; she acted like making Sangria with Vodka was very unauthentic. So the four of us shared a liter of Sangria. The Sangria tastes good but I judged the alcohol content to be substantially less than that of a typical red wine. So order the Sangria if you would like a light alcohol drink with great flavor and order wine if you want something with more bite. 

When we ordered, the owner told us that one of the dishes would take at least 35 minutes since it was being made from scratch. We were up for a leisurely Sunday evening meal with good company so that was not a problem for us and spent about an hour and twenty minutes there. Of course, if you are on a tighter schedule, ask what can be prepared fast. 

Service was attentive without the waitresses introducing themselves and announcing that they would be taking care of us that evening. I prefer it that way.  

I decided on five stars based the pig ears and chicken Algarve, nice atmosphere, leisurely but attentive service and a modest bill: $59 for the four us with tax but before the tip and there was more than enough food.",2

It's easier to compare to this restaurant to other Brazilian steakhouses in large cities. Against that competition, Samba stacks up very well. The decor is among the best in Madison - the building is lovely, and creatively restored. The salad bar is a work of art in itself. The live music at brunch and most nights is a great bonus.

Also, compared to these other places, Samba is a bargain. $35 for dinner and $20 for brunch is a steal for high-end all you can eat with meat. For those that are on a tighter budget, salad bar only is completely acceptable and sacrifices little - you can certainly compose a great meal there. 

The service from the Gauchos is entertaining - I agree with those who have said that the waitstaff can be slow in refreshing water and getting drinks. The bar is great and the drinks are reasonably priced.

Last time I drove cross country, I noticed my headlights were barely helping me see the road at night. I kept turning on the brights at every opportunity. I've had someone sand them before and that helped a little for a little while, but last week I finally decided I had to get new headlights. I called several places on Yelp to get a quote for installing the new lights. Based on catalog estimates, Kinkade's quoted me their rate for one hour ($40 less than another highly rated place), but said they were pretty sure they could do it in less than an hour. True to their word, it only took them 1/2 an hour so they only charged me 1/2 of the hourly rate. Plus, they were all very gracious. The waiting room is exceptionally clean too, as other reviewers have noted.",3

The food:

The chips and salsa were a waste of time.  The chips tasted stale.

The dinner salads were pretty forgettable, too.  They arrived smothered in vinaigrette dressing.

Well before we had a chance to finish the salads, the entrees hit the table.  If the salads had been worth finishing, that would have meant cold entrees.  We both ordered carne asada tacos.  I've had better tacos at Del Taco (fast food for those unfamiliar with the chain).  The tacos were served with rice and beans, neither of which tasted all that great.  

The service:  

The service was clumsy in my opinion.  The wait staff seemed far to eager to remove plates from the table.  For example, a member of the wait staff reached over me to snatch my unfinished salad off the table.  If a shortage of plates is the problem, buy some more plates for God's sake.    

Our waitress didn't seem to be a good listener.  We told her at the outset we were finished with our trip and on our way to the airport.  Nevertheless, at the conclusion of our meal she offered desert and when we declined bid us an enjoyable vacation.",2

Here's how it works: be prepared to wait in line if you come during peak eating times. It's $7.99 for your choice of two items (sandwhich, soup or salad). Its kind of like a subway line where you can see everything made in front of you. You order your sandwhich or salad with the first person in the line. And you just move down the line. And you order your soup from the people standing in front of the soups. There are add ins to the soup like bacon, cheese or croutons for an additional charge. By the time you get to the cashier, your entire order is ready. They also have syrups to add flavor to your drinks. 

My absolute favorites are the BBQ pulled pork sandwhich with clam chowder. The sandwhiches are huge and packed with flavor. And the clam chowder is thick and chunky. The blueberry maple salad was a refreshing alternative to clam chowder on a hot day. The dressing they used was light and added to the fresh blueberries and maple chunks in the salad.

However once being sat the food was really good! The kobe beef was amazing. The beef toro and pork belly were tremendous though. Personally, save the $23 on the kobe and just order a ton of $5 meats. The quality is amazing. Overall a really great, affordable, Korean bbq place in las Vegas!",2

Chloe was very sweet and took her time. She asked a number of times how I liked my nails and wanted to make sure I was pleased w her design and application. This place is super clean, plays nice relaxing music, has complimentary beverages, and they don't treat you like garbage like so many other nail salons in Henderson/Vegas do.

I ordered the mixed kabob plate, which came with some salad and rice and orange chatni. The kabobs were great, although I wish they had a little more spice. The technique they use to roll the kabob was similar to how my mother makes it. The rice was nice, although I personally don't like any rice. 

The chatni was superb. The Orange one was a little sweet and had a melted buttery texture. The green chatni had the spice I was looking for. I practically drank it after I was done with my meal. 

The meal was prepared in a reasonable amount of time, the staff was really nice and the restaurant itself was in pretty good shape. The manager took time to chat with the patrons, which is nice. If I ever come back to Vegas, this will absolutely be my first stop.",1

Each dish that came to our table had a very specific and original taste profile. Quinoa with pineapple and crispy fried tofu was sweet and refreshing, the charred bok choy was perfect in its little pool of salty soy sauce, the ramen (my favorite!) had a deliciously smoky& rich broth with nice thin noodles. Dessert was amazing!! Miso coconut tiramisu had little crunchy chunks of butterscotch on top with creamy, light& delicious mousse underneath.

18313,1,1546473600000,"This restaurant opened recently so this review is based on an early visit. The kitchen will likely evolve and hopefully improve as they gain experience and receive feedback. 

The highlights:
Chicken Katsu is perfectly breaded and crispy. 
Curry flavour was nice. 
Kimchee is fragrant and sweetened with apples. 
Sushi rice served with meals is good. 
Meat portions are large for both Chicken Katsu and Hamburger dish. 
Decor is really nice. 

Needs Improvement:
Calamari breaking was puffy and tasteless. The accompanying chips acted as a plate filler. The chips tastes better than the Clamato. 
The hamburger was overly salty and had a burnt taste. Also seemed really greasy. 
Hungrier people will find that rice serving isn't enough. 
The amount of soup served with meal seemed small compared to bowl size. One of these should be adjusted. 

Coleslaw salad was just okay. Nothing to write home about.",1

Where it sat for about ten minutes because they couldn't figure out how to restart the engine with an immobilizer sensor key. (That's my fault for not showing them how to start it, or giving them the valet key) but they never came to find me to ask. Then once they did get it into the tunnel wash they left my rear two windows down about an inch! Which flooded the interior door panels and seats. Livid, I get the manager who just said they would vacuum it up. They ended up wiping down the interior and cleaning my tires. I expected them to shampoo the seats because of their stupidity but I'm just glad I got out of there alive with no scratches or damage to my truck. The wash and work was subpar. A $3 car wash joint cleans better. Their waiting room had a dead cockroach and the car wash machines looked very worn out. Never again! Almost as lame Jacksons up the road is better.",2
18316,1,1548720000000,"The ambiance here is nice, somewhat chic like, but they also have a large screen tv by the sushi bar for some MNF action. For a sushi joint in the middle of the desert, they had a lot to offer on their menu.

But my first two questions alone confirmed the fact that having a sushi joint in the middle of the desert may have some issues.

Hows the toro? Sorry we dont serve toro during the summer time.
Ok, how about the halibut? No halibut here, only during winter.

So that's a great start there. And yes both items were on the menu; that's why I asked how they were. Oh well.

Anyways, I ordered some tuna nigiri http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=CTl0wonkUIRRANoVogG2BQ, salmon nigiri http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=BvZ7OBpRxsxtH0bF7KE1ug, albacore and yellowtail http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=grNHXCPTzT-ZLcDw75TgwA. They obviously used the best pieces here, nice, vibrant colors and fresh. The rice was a bit off though.

I also ordered their spicy salmon roll. Very hot, they pretty much drowned the fish in siracha sauce. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/v4qyBRpTBvOO55M4IAqNNg?select=HlM6L-jLtZEclnVUc_h2pg

The service here was neutral. I was the only person at the bar, and maybe like 10 other people in the dining area so it was pretty desolate as it is, but it took some time to get some decent service here. And if you're looking for the best (ie toro, halibut) they may not be there. But then again, this place is in the middle of the desert.",2

My interaction was with one waitress in particular who forgot our drink order, then forgot our food order, then forgot to bring us chips and water (4 times she mentioned she would get the chips before they actually arrived). 

For food, I recommend the carne asada tacos which were delicious. I would pass on the nachos or anything that requires chips to eat since they are not freshly prepared. 

For service, I recommend not coming at all. Maybe.. Maybe get it to go if it is offered. But I can't stress enough how bad the service is to warrant a 1 star review  

Thank you for reading.",2

18416,2,1546646400000,"I thought long and hard about this review and here is the bottom line. This is just pitiful. Apparently, no one connected with this place cares...; they are just going through the motions. The place looks and feels blah. The food is uninspired - dull, cold, boring. This may have been the most depressing meal I have had in a while. And I have been eating at Garcia's going back to the mid 80s. Its time for management to re-commit or just retire. 
Anyone thinking this is ok isn't being honest with themselves. Apathy can no longer be accepted. I work too hard for my money and I am sure you do too. This review makes me sad, and I am sorry to be so blunt.",2

Thank you for the THICK cut tomato and grilled onions....mmmmm. Licked my fingers more than once after polishing off a double patty (I think I will pass on eating dinner now, thanks). The fries are thick cut and full salt (more finger licking). No, I am pretty sure there is not a healthy item on the menue...so this is a treat...but a welcome one. As far as the pricing goes...yep it is a bit pricey...but I can spend $6-7 on a ""value"" meal at a fast food joint...why not get some real meat and toppings for a few bucks more...Share the fries there is more than enough to go around :)",2
18418,3,1546905600000,"Simply outstanding.

Simple decor.  Knowledgeable bartenders.  Calm atmosphere.  Old school jazz.  And most importantly world-class cocktails.

They have a cool cocktail list on the wall featuring 6-8 creations form cocktail guru Dale DeGroff who I understand had a hand in starting the bar.  Also there is a huge cocktail bible on the bar so you can order just about anything your heart desires.  The key to any great cocktail bar is being able to rely on the recommendations of the bartenders, and Embury was definitely on point.  The most interesting drink of the night was the Faust's Pact that was made with muddled jalapenos, though everything was very good.

Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'd definitely go out of my way to make a stop by Embury for a couple cocktails.",2

18428,1,1547164800000,"Our son turned 18 and wanted his first tattoo. He is a baseball pitcher and lives to throw. For years he has thought about what he wanted for his tattoo.  We interviewed a few tattoo artists at other shops and we just didn't feel a connection with their personality or their art.

Kong was recommended by a friend and we reached out to him by text. He responded immediately, with class and excitement. We had a good dialogue I made an appointment to consult with him.  The moment we walked into the shop we were greeted with a warm smile and handshake. He sat down with us and listened to us. What we liked most about him is that he gave us his suggestions on how to customize the tattoo to make it even better. His suggestions were right on point! I knew this was a sign of a true experienced professional that really cared. He immediately set to work on the drawing. It took about an hour and when it was done, it was beyond our expectations. He added touches that made our hearts soar! It was perfect and we went forward. We felt very comfortable with him in everything that he did. The shop is clean, and every precaution was taken to make sure everything was sanitized properly and that we felt comfortable. 

He verbally prepared her son for the tattoo and was very clear about the process and if our son needed to take breaks and so forth. We were allowed to sit with our son the entire time. A tattoo on the chest is not easy, but Kong helped our son get through it with distraction and laughter. 

This most detailed, incredible tattoo only took about two hours and was beyond our expectations as a family. None of us could stop smiling. The work is amazing and we will never go to anyone else for a tattoo.   

We highly recommend Kong! He can do every kind of tattoo and he cares so much about his clients and his work! Thank you Kong from the  bottom of our hearts for designing a piece of art that will live with our son forever!",3

Multiple nails were crooked, different sizes, and horribly painted. He said he would re-do it for me... 6 tries later it just kept looking worse and worse, I was so upset. After 2HOURS! Of sitting there I just told him to just paint it plain red, it still looked so bad! They red had streaks of black in it.

I go back after 4 of my nails fell off that same day and demanded a refund. I go in there asking for the owner and the guy that did my nails the night before tells me that he is the owner, I was shocked. He told me that they don't do refunds he would give me a certificate for me to come back and get them done again. I don't want to go to that place ever again, I can't believe he wouldn't give me my money back. Eventually I got my cash and left.

Delicious and fun! I ordered the smoked chicken Waldorf salad which was a little over dressed but the chicken had a great smoky flavor to it. Not too smoky which was nice. The fish and chips were amazing according to my daughter so I had to try a bite. I have to agree with her! My other daughter ordered the french dip and she was really happy with it.

Appetizers: Shrimp Cocktail Entree, Smoke Stack, and Fruits de Mer

The smoke stack had a combination of different seafood in an elegant tasty package. Highly recommended. 

Entrees: 
Shrimp Po' Boy - standard Po' boy but I will note that the breading was great on the shrimp. Often times you see the breading coming off mid-way through the sandwich - not here. 

Blue Marlin - probably the best dish. Uniquely prepared and fantastic taste. 

Special of the day:  Friday Perch Fish Fry - classic fish fry, well done.

Duck Breast - Very rich and full of flavor. Tasty but a little too much fat left over.",2
18442,3,1547337600000,"For $5 per toddler on a Saturday morning, I really can't complain.   This place is a facility and shouldn't be judged on service (at least the way we saw it during open bounce - maybe parties are different?).   

There was an attendant in the room with us the whole time, but it's very much on the parent to ensure the safety of your child.   Unfortunately there are some parents who don't see a need to enforce the rules; and to expect a 17 year old attendant to police a 14 year old running the wrong way up a bounce house slide is a little ridiculous.   Bottom line - it's good cheap fun for small kids as long as you have an eagle eye and don't mind doing a little good natured parenting to other kids who aren't being supervised all that vigilantly.   If you don't have the personality to tell other people's kids to tone it down, you probably want to avoid going here; because there were a couple of older kids who had zero supervision from their parents (in the corner reading a book) who saw no problems with aggressive horseplay around the 2 - 5 year old set with no regard for their safety.

The inflatables were clean, there was some wear on them from lots of use; but nothing was unsafe or stinky - again that might have been because we were the first of the day to be in there.",1

18447,3,1547251200000,"The first time I tried this location, I was pretty smitten - at least with the quality and crispness of the main attraction 'the fish' in the fish n chips. This time not so much, the fish was undercooked.

I'll say that on that level I would have given a 2 rating. However, several redeeming factors ensued or precluded the fish incident. 

For starters their clam chowder isn't to bad at all. In fact it's about a 4 on it's own...OK good start - and those cute Oyster crackers (they have to count for at least a half star).

The fries and tartar sauce were up to 'relative par', I especially like the crispy bits and pieces at the bottom of the basket, and the sauce flavourful enough to eat on its own.
  
Unfortunately, as I mentioned at the open - this trip the fish was well undercooked, glassy and somewhat clear - you know the look. 

Our server did have it changed (mentioning to the cooks to cook it more in the future - not just my order), however, the new order came back less cooked than I'd like, yet enough to eat and not bring up the previous layers of food already eaten. I was very surprised, though I guess even fish n chips can go a bit south from time to time. Perhaps, a third try???

Note: The large order of fish (3 pieces) is enough to feed several mouths and fairly priced - if folks want to share.",2

My wife and I heard about the restaurant from a neighbour and decided to go on a whim with our two kids seeing as it was conveniently in the neighbourhood. Walking in the atmosphere was immediately seen as sketchy, with drunks loud at the bar, (hardly an appropriate place for the neighbourhood) lighting so darkly dimmed and the servers who reeked of cigarettes, it was hardly appealing and I should have walked back out the door right then and there. Our food took forty minutes and the server was hardly apologetic, when we asked to briefly speak to the manager she simply stated that the resturant was busy and there was a slight back up in the kitchen, without and offer to reimburse us.
Tip for management; if your food is going to take longer than twenty five minutes (standard in most restaurants) then please advise your guests that it will take longer then usual BEFORE THEN SIT DOWN. This place is out of character for such a family oriented neighbourhood and will not return, especially not encourage those of the neighbourhood to not endure such a dingy setting.

They give you a delivery schedule and you put out all your empties on the stated date.  Only to come home to your empties bottles rolling around the neighborhood because they didn't bother to show up yet AGAIN.  

We got so annoyed by this repeated problem and began to wonder if it was us getting confused.  We asked them to change the deliveries to our business address so we could actually watch and track their deliveries and accountability.  It soon became very clear that it was not our imagination and that they in fact missed deliveries on a regular basis.  They don't have any problem in their billing department, those folks get the bills out every month, on time, and they sure expect you to pay promptly, but God help you if you need a drink of water.

They missed my last delivery (although the driver marked off on his little sheet that he came here), and they were supposed to make a special makeup delivery here first thing this morning.

This was just getting weird, but I was there so I went with it.  I placed my normal Caesar salad small as it's huge (just like Grimaldi's) and a pizza with just sun dried tomato's for topping.

I own old vehicles. Kris is an honest guy and he actually told me to stop spending money on one of my vehicles! He knew that the new replacement truck I got would mean I'd only need him for oil changes instead of coming through every few months to fix the next thing that died on my old truck. Now that's an honest auto guy.

Once we went to the counter, the staff was very friendly and even custom made my order because I can't stand anything spicy, and literally everything on their menu to do with meat, was spicy.

They make their own sausage, sooo good, and their sauce isn't too sweet from the basil.  Their crust has some sweetness to it; it is not over powering or distracting to the food.  The sweetness creates a balance to the overall pizza.  The texture is PERFECT!  I'm making myself hungry.

The only redeeming factor is they retained the decor from the previous sandwich deli and is very spacious and clean for a burrito place.

But the tables were all full which was fine again, we expected it. Then the hostess tells us that its going to be an hour wait and says it very rude i might add. Im a server at a restaurant i understand how a wait works we would have waited maybe 20 minutes tops nobody is there for a concert. So obviously we left",2

We both had the El Pollo Loco Omelet  which was nice and feeling. And we shared the caramelized banana and pecan brioche french toast, surprisingly the French toast was nice with great depth of flavor and not too sweet. I liked the food here but I wasn't blown away.

The fried wontons and crispy and tasty.  We have dined in restaurant and dine take out.  This is one of our new favorites for sure!,3

Located in a residential area, in a tiny strip mall with only a 7 Eleven, from my recollection, a late-nite stop by.

A total takeout/pickup place is its original design but fairly big with about 4 sit-down tables and quite clean and bright too.

I played it safe and ordered the Hawaiian, and didn't disappoint.  Small pizza @ $12 is more than other places, but better quality.

also serve pasta, wings and wraps, of all things.",2

I tried the enchiladas too and they were tasty.  I want to come back and try new things.  Definitely worth a visit!",2
18602,1,1548374400000,"For the price, it should have been much better.

The serice was really good.   The staff gets 5 stars.

The steak wasn't the greatest.  I mean, it wasn't too bad.But, for the price I thought it should have been better.    For a commercial thing in Vegas, I mean it's a touristy thing, let the tourists have fun, they will like it.   I live in San Francisco and have a lot of really nice steak places to go to and I've eaten at many others which have had better cuts of meat and were cooked better.

We sent one back because it was well done and we asked for a medium.  It came out right away, no waiting an hour for them to cook another, I'm sure they 'borrowed' someone elses to get ours out quickly, which is nice.  But, that wasn't cooked much less than the first one. :(

The steak was pretty tough.   The lobster tail was a little over cooked.

If you're not used to going to really nice places, (My Mom ate with us and she isn't used to going out to places like this) and she had a great time and didn't know the difference.   If you know the difference, you'll probably want to go elsewhere.

We spent in the neighborhood of $500 for 4 people.  It should have been the best quality for that price.    Now, we didn't eat the cheap stuff either.  2 of us had the surf & turf with the lobster tail.  and a couple of glasses of wine.

We skipped dessert and they brought us one small one on the house, that was nice.  Like I said, the staff was perfect from start to finish.  The quality of the meal was the only problem.",1

Well, having had some pretty mediocre ones lately, this one really stands out. The sauce was nice and tangy and the cheese was ooey gooey melted perfection. Had a pretty decent margarita too. I sat at the bar during lunch and the service was great and fast. Now, why is it whenever they say the plate is really hot, the first thing I do is grab it? Muy caliente!

There was only one problem, a group member and I were wearing sandals. A big no no! You must wear closed toe shoes. Luckily, Jonathon provided two of pairs of his sneakers for us to borrow so that we could participate. 

We opted to do the 2 hours of knife throwing for $35. Jonathon let us know the rules of the facility and gave us basic instructions on how to throw the knives. For some of us it took a while to get the hang of it, while others were naturals (shocking and scary!). Jonathon was always available to give pointers on how to improve our throw. It is BYOB, but just be careful not to drink too much! You want to remain as focused as possible to hit those bulls eyes!

Best breakfast we had in Vegas; the blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries were great accents to our meal, and I loved that they have real lettuce (arugula, greens) versus non-nutritional man-created iceberg lettuce.  

This place just opened 2 months ago so it's still relatively unknown by mainstreamers making it fast, quaint, and personable.  It's family run versus corporate and so there's a lot of pride in how this place operates even by staff.

18627,1,1548892800000,"We came here when we realized, after driving all the way to Chambly, that Unibroe did not offer tastings or tours.  Our research showed that Fourquet Fourchette is like the unofficial Unibroe  tasting room and I love waterfront dining so we were excited.

The interior is reminiscent of an old tavern and they have prints of all of the Unibroe beer labels framed and hung in the walls.  The lake side wall is all windows and let in a lot of light.  It was a very warm, relaxing setting for lunch.

We ordered Unibroe beer flights, French onion soup, and a big meat, cheese, and veggie platter.  As soon as our food and drink came out, so did the flies... Tens of fruit flies buzzing around our meal the entire time we were there.  I'm not sure if it was from unclean beer taps or food sitting out too long but it was totally disgusting and a major turn off for us.  And there was not really anything we could do about it short of walking it so we tried to finish quickly so we could get out of there.  The soup was good, the platter I would not recommend, warm and soggy. 

Based on our overall experience I cannot recommend this place - if you are set on a Unibroe tasting you are better off buying an assortment of their beers, which are available everywhere in and around Montreal, and doing your own tasting!",1

I went on a tour to vegas and the first buffet they took us to was here. The server forced us to sit with people we didn't even know, when there were plenty of tables to sit at. The food itself did not taste like the cook/chef even cared who he was serving or what he was cooking. Alot of the food was unseasoned and the broccoli was very bitter (as though not washed). At least it was somewhat edible. It was just very sad to eat. ($20 per person) Other than that, the restaurant was very big and the servers were quick to clean up our plates.  I do not recommend this place if you are a person that truly appreciates good food.",3

Met Jasen was very impressed by his professional attitude.  After my oil change was complete, Jasen took me out to my car and explained that it might be time to do the transmission fluid change.  I agreed to the $150 service and waited for it to be done.  I paid a total of around $180 and went home satisfied.  I noticed a drop of oil in my driveway when I got home but thought it was just residual oil from the service.  Friday evening, I notice that my car has left a puddle of oil\fluid in my garage.  I immediately went inside, scheduled an appointment online for Saturday morning and intended on going in at 8.  Jasen got my appointment request and called me Friday night to confirm the issue and have me bring it in.  Saturday morning I arrive at 8 and am greeted by staff who take my car right back.  Moments later, I meet Ron (Owner) who was very friendly and explained what happened - the tech accidently overfilled my transmission fluid and it was leaking.  Ron and his tech installed the proper amount of transmission fluid, power washed the bottom of my car and provided me with a coupon for a free car wash.  The big surprise was when Ron handed me a check for the original $180 I had paid - I was shocked.  Ron even offered to come to my house and power wash my driveway because of the mistake.  Couldn't help but to be impressed by the service I received and though a mistake was made, the staff went above and beyond to make it right.  I have every intention of taking my vehicle back to Ron's and suggesting them to friends\family.  I fully expected to have to haggle them on the repair but that never happened - Ron stated that ""This isn't the way we do business"" and I certainly believe it.

After passing the place many times, I finally stopped in and was the only patron there. I chatted it up with the owner and his wife, who were super cool people.

I told him that his Yelp ratings seemed to be pretty good, and it seemed like he definitely had some signature products that put him in a market of his own. He said that The Phoenix New Times told him the same thing, but that business has been extremely slow.

He gave the the lowdown on almost every creation on the menu. This guy created and makes all of his own sauces and dog works of art. It's places like this that are a true work of art, and a hidden gem. They need love to stay alive and in the market, and in this case that love needs to come in the form of cash money.

He ended up setting me up with the famous Maui Dog creation and a side of fries. I must say, that these dogs actually compete with the Sonoran Style Dogs that you find in the Southwest. Between Maui Dog and all of the Sonoran Hotdog joints in this town, they offer competition to the boring, old school Chicago Dog Market. It's very important to have culture in a city, and Phoenix needs to allow these different cultures to grow and flourish.

I know that the area isn't the most lucrative, but these people are some super cool artists, and you don't want to see this place go under due to a lack of support.

Lets all Yelp together and save this much needed icon, so if nothing else, we can have one extra spot to keep on Yelping about!",2
18673,2,1547424000000,"Easily the best meal I enjoyed in Vegas this past week. I was on a vacation with my sisters. Knowing we would be eating out for 6 days we tried to keep the budget in check. This restaurant was recommended by a friend of my sister did not disappoint as far as the food was concerned. It is tucked away in the back of the food court. Location isn't great...I suppose that is how they keep the prices down. ""Outdoor tables"" are actually inside. Lighting in the interior of the restaurant is way too bright.
Service was very average...our waiter was a hyper-macho Italiano who kept himself busy fawning over the young girls eating next to us, and chatting with his buddies out in the food court plaza. At the end of our meal he was so carried away with his buddies that he had totally forgotten about us, and need to be retrieved by a bus boy. 
The Caeser Salad that we shared was good. Filet mignon meatballs with spaghetti and red sauce were delicious, as was the wood-fired Quatro Stagioni pizza. I highly recommend the food...the service not so much.",2

Rented online in January and picked the bike up last week.  Met Robert at the rental desk and he made the process easy.  No last minute changes/upgrades, etc...  (Had my own gear.)

In talking with Robert about a couple of planned trips (got the Butler AZ motorcycle map) he made some great suggestions.  Sent me to 2 different rides.  Awesome selections.

Would need an hour to describe the rides I took (mainly north and east). All were ~ 250 miles/day with many twisties, elevation changes (including up to 7450 feet) and fun towns.  There are so many options to ride and felt like I only scratched the surface.

If you head to Phoenix and look to rent a harley (or a few non-harley selections) I'd strogly suggest there guys.  They are all riders and had great insights and suggestions.

And speaking of the service, it's slowness was somewhat of let down. I guess they were sort of busy, but it didn't look THAT busy. And one more negative star for luke-warm bibimbap stone bowl - imo, the bowl needs to be sizzling hot that it'd make the rice crusty.

For a single Bombay, it was about $9.

It was very good, slightly spicy and garnished with celery and a pickled green bean.  This was my first time trying a pickled green bean and I thought it complimented the drink very well.

The staff received us wonderfully, but that is as good as it got.  Even though we received complimentary fruit and a few pieces of sushi, the food was very disappointing.

The sushi rice was under seasoned and the pieces of yellow tail and salmon that covered the rice were entirely to big for the tiny bit of rice.  The sushi rice was terribly underseasoned, very bland and needed more vinegar, sugar, and salt.  This ruined the sushi for me.

My wife ordered the BBQ Ribs and let me say I have found more meat at a vegan buffet.  The ribs were fat and bone!  Where's the BEEF!

We should have seen the Red Flag, the place was empty on a Friday night.  Before the food arrived my wife and I thought, ""This is great, we have the whole place to ourselves, WE ARE SO LUCKY!""

I am baffled that there is not a high end movie going experience available on the strip but yet there is an m&m store and coke store....oh well, best advice is to just skip this theater....",2
18776,1,1548115200000,"Stayed here in March 2013. Maybe the remodel has things a bit confused. Hotel room was well decorated but it was not clean. There was a dirty wine glass in my room and another missing. The dirty wine glass had someone's lipstick on it. YUCK!! I also found a toenail in my bed. I called down about the glass and the employee called and said id have two new glasses ASAP. I mentioned the toenail and the rep said ""wow, sorry that's so odd"" Yeah..no kidding. That was all I got. I asked for feather pillows and I was told they didn't carry them. Fair enough, although odd for this kind of hotel. My last nights stay they came to replace my pillows with feather..hmm...Then there is the tub. It had jets, which I was looking forward to. What I wasn't expecting was that the jets were dirty as well. I turned them on and this green algae kept shooting out. After a few different tries to flush the stuff out I just gave up. Major let down. Upon speaking with the hotel staff at check out as well they did not really care. They just said ""that's odd"" and ""I'm so sorry."" I would have liked some compensation off of my hotel stay because it wasn't cheap, instead after writing a letter upon my return I got a response for a free upgrade if I stay there at a future date. Upgrade depending on the time of year etc special rules and restrictions apply. I have a year to use it, we'll see if I cash that in or just move on to a nicer more put together establishment.

I've traveled a lot over the years, and I think this was probably the worst hotel stay of my life to date, and that includes the time I got my stuff stolen by employees.",2

Located between a laundromat and a street full of meth labs, this cosmopolitan alehouse serves such sophisticated fare as Bud Light and Jim Beam. My dad used to get soused here every day after work( explains my salty, cynical outlook on life). Whoa, TMI. Anyhow, a couple times after i reached drinking age and moved out of the nest, i stopped in to try and bond with the old man. It wasn't that fun. Mostly, because the jukebox was loaded with Seger, Seger and more Seger. I also don't really partake in those bar-top video gambling dealies. Other than that,  there's not much to do there. However, if you are in search of a thrice divorced cougar with more tattoos than teeth; the girl of your dreams might just be sitting on a dirty bar stool at the G-Wiz.",2
18781,2,1547510400000,"Scottsdale Fashion Square Shrimp Salad.  That's what I ordered both times I lunched at Fred's and both times I was extremely satisfied!  I was also impressed with the friendly and attentive service and the welcoming, fun atmosphere of the restaurant.

I must admit, I was hesitant to eat at Fred's - I had an image of snooty staff and crazy expensive menu items.  But this image in my head was proved wrong when I went in for happy hour several months ago; i had a very pleasant experience.  And then with so many four and five star Yelp reviews, I just had to make my way back for lunch!

Try their flavored iced tea - it's really refreshing and tasty... and the fresh bread they serve adds just the right carb deliciousness to the meal. I recommend dipping it in the olive oil on the table.

I look forward to returning to Fred's for brunch and/or dinner. And while I overheard someone say that Fred's has the best Creme Brulee in the world, that Meyer Lemon Square sounds more up my alley!

***Oh, and a pointer for those that don't want to be tempted to shop at Barney's if you decide to dine at Fred's.  Park out front on the Camelback side of the building and go straight to Fred's via the elevator outside. It's worked for me so far... it's a treat enough to dine at Fred's (as it will cost you a pretty penny).",2
18783,2,1547078400000,"I came here for the lobster poutine and ended up having dinner.

As part of La poutine week, Rock Lobster was advertised as one of the options and due to when they open (5pm), we ended up having dinner while we were there.

We lucked out and the lobster boil was discounted to $25 which includes a boiled lobster, side of fries, and beans.  I thought it was delicious.  I thought at $25 it was reasonable for what I got but regular price (I think $45) is a bit much.

The lobster poutine we all thought was pretty good although they were a bit stingy on the lobster.

Decor, it was okay, nothing to write home about.  It has a bar with TVs if you ever wanted to stop by for a game.",2

18795,1,1547596800000,"I never do a review on a restaurant besides saying ""the meal was delicious, etc"". However, this place deserves every praise in the book. From the time we sat down we felt the warmth that overtook this room. The servers were so kind, friendly, and most of all made us feel like we were inside of their home. Our appetizers...well there are no words for them...seriously the polenta and mushrooms are to die for, the home made burrata cheese was a ball of soft delicious goodness, and the crudo, well is out of this world fresh and so light that I could have 5 of them no problem. When our pasta came (as you see there isn't a picture of it), it smelled so good that we went right to town and crushed it. Spaghetti, pizza, cavatelli, and rigatoni were AMAZING. Then we closed out with the dessert...and the butterscotch pudding sealed the deal! Craft drinks are also so unbelievable! The best local spot in town hands down. And a big shout out to Chef James! His cooking is amazing!",2
18795,3,1547164800000,"I do love restaurants that are in converted houses, don't ask me why.  The patio is great because in the winter they have heaters and on the weekends a guy sitting outside playing guitar and singing in Spanish, making for great ambiance.  
But this is tough because I've been to this place and gotten 5 star service and meal, and then I've gone and gotten 2 star service and meals.  So I've settled for in between.   As for the menu they do have excellent, authentic mole which is hard to come by.  I personally adore the lamb dish  which is fall off the bone delicious as well as the rib-eye if you are looking for a nice protein.  If you are more in the mood for something in a tortilla their shrimp and fish tacos or seafood enchiladas are both stuffed with fresh seafood and dressed with homemade sauces.  They serve healthful sides like black beans, brown rice and fresh veggies.  To end the night I highly recommend the chocolate pie which has a toasted almond crust and creamy, chocolate mouse filling. 
On a side note you can buy tamales in the winter months full of fun flavors, like chocolate and pineapple.",3
18796,2,1548028800000,"I have very mixed feeling about l'Academie.  I've eaten here on four different occasions, and every time it's been a completely different experience.  Everything from the food to the service to the entire restaurant atmosphere can vary greatly.  

The last time I was there the service was impeccable.  Despite it being a busy Friday night, we were seated swiftly in a quiet area.  The waiter quickly brought us water, opened our bottle of wine, and poured us glasses.  I had several questions concerning the menu (high cholesterol makes one ask about the butter and cream content of dishes - sometimes something that looks like it won't be cream heavy is...) that were answered with expertise.  When our waiter didn't know, he promised to go and ask the chef; he returned within 3 minutes with a detailed answer.  

I decided to go with the tuna steak with coriander-lime vinaigrette; I had ordered this dish on a previous occasion and had been much impressed that they had cooked it per my request.  Unfortunately, I don't think the dish I was served on this second occasion had anything in common with the first.  I asked for my tuna to be cooked rare, almost blue.  I order tuna at restaurants because I find that the slight searing beautifully complements that raw interior; it's like sushi but better.  Unfortunately, the steak of tuna that was brought was cooked all the way through, to an extent that it was almost chewy and tough.  It was like tuna out of a can, but worse.  

My companion ordered a filet mignon cooked rare; alas, his dish was similar to mine.  The sauces were very nice, but the fact that the meat was so overcooked destroyed the whole dish.  I hate to be left wanting when I'm paying $25 for a dish, yet that is what happened.

However, on the other hand, I have had some very good meals here.  The first time around, the tuna was cooked to perfection, as was my friend's steak.  The gnocchi with blue cheese is a delightful dish; I would probably order it every time, if I did not have that slight aversion to cream.  The rest of the pastas are fairly standard, nothing incredible, but a decent meal for a decent price.  I've only had Moules et Frites once, but it was incredible.  I polished off every last morsel in the largest bowl of mussels that I've ever tackled.  The veal is again a hit and miss dish; I've seen people rave about it, and I've seen  left on the plate.  

In conclusion, this restaurant gets three stars because of its high variability.  I've had a meal here that I would give five stars, but another that I would give one.  My suggestion is to stick with the pasta and the Moules et Frites; they're a little bit cheaper, come in generous portions, and tend not to disappoint.",2
18798,3,1547251200000,"Woke up with a bagel craving. This place is near my hotel. I called ahead to make sure they sold bagels, they did. Awesome! As soon as I got back to my hotel room and unwrapped my bagel, it was 100% obvious that this was a bagel from a bag... like, I'm talking grocery store bread aisle, pre-packaged (Thomas'?) not bakery made. I can taste and feel all the preservatives immediately. That's also why even though I ordered it toasted (and it was) it felt more like it was microwaved, because all the preservatives in the pre-packaged bagels prevent them from getting crispy when toasted. Cream cheese was same quality. Gross. I couldn't even finish it. Not what I expected from a coffee shop or place with good reviews on their breakfast. 

The thing that really gets me is that these bagels are displayed in open baskets behind the counter, making them look like they are bakery fresh, or possibly made in shop. However, the worker didn't get my bagel from there, he went in the back to get my bagel and brought it back out when it was done being toasted and cheesed. Therefore, I didn't see him take it out of the bag he likely had back there. Had I known, I would have asked for my money back before leaving with the bagel. 

Suggestion to the store, it looks like other people like your coffee and breakfast food. Don't cheapen the quality of everything else by selling bagels, I could have walked to the grocery store and been more satisfied. Stick to what you know.",2
18802,1,1548460800000,"Cleveland Hopkins, I don't care what they say about you. I love going to the airport and I've never *knock on wood* had issues getting through security.

My faves are the Dunkin' Donuts (getting my Blueberry Iced coffee fix on) and the fact that I can find a place to charge my iPhone while waiting for a flight. The only downside is getting to the airport with 45 minutes to spare (because I always have to be 'fashionably' late) and needing to literally RUN to the Continental, er, United Concourse... especially down and up those stairs!

Compared to other airports I've been to, yes, Cleveland is tiny. But - shouldn't that be something you're grateful for?",2

I used to drive the 45+ mins to eat at Phu Thanh in Mesa and loved their food.
unfortunately that restaurant closed 6 months ago. Well the family has opened a new restaurant here in Peoria.  

The best Pho I've found in Phoenix. They will make it any way you like. Rare beef on the side, steamed mung sprouts. extra noodle, Whatever condiments a true Pho lover would want. They will make it happen. The key is knowing what you want. and, not expecting someone to read your mind..  The herb pouch they use for the broth has the perfect blend of savory and sweet. One of the best things about their broth is how the flavor stays consistent all the way 'til your done. Truly a rare thing...

Banh Xeo is filled with fresh veggies and a few shrimp. Cut off some of this crispy crepe and add some fresh basil, cucumber, fish sauce, and roll it into an awesome lettuce wrap. This is good healthy eats !!
Their Iced Coffee is top notch too..
They make all the various Vietnamese Sweet Bean, and tapioca desserts. 
Trust me those are worth a try..

Stew
Noodle

4 stars - for the service, I found the waiter kind of cocky and insincere,  however this could be my own personnel preference. 

3 stars - for ambiance and decor, the restaurant was pretty cramped, I felt like I was sharing a table with the other patrons next to us.

Overall, still the best steak I ever had.",3

Even though I showed up late to meet my coworkers and the food was not exactly fresh, it was certainly apparent that for Scottsdale sushi this is a hot spot. Several of the rolls I tried were unique with innovative flavor combinations. 

For dessert we headed into the private karaoke rooms where I ordered a large humiliation sundae. My only caution is to be prepared for the most random song selection you've ever seen. With very minimal hip hop or 80's tunes and a heavy dose of Celine Dion, just be prepared to double my intake of bombs in order to be comfortable singing here.",2

The frosting. There isn't a frosting out there that can match the creamy deliciousness you'll experience when this cream cheese frosting hits your tongue. 

I can never enjoy any other cake after eating theirs, they're ruined other cakes for me!!! Their chocolate chocolate chip cake and white chocolate raspberry cake speak to my soul. I have a feeling they understand me better than my husband. 

Note that if you eat this cake you will never be the same person again. Your mom might not recognize you when you visit for Christmas. But that's okay. Just bring a cake with you and change her, too.

I wouldn't say that they were the best things I have ever eaten, but they do rank high on the delicious scale.

We had the ""weekender"" brunch. It took 40 minutes to appear and turned out to be 2 poached eggs, a swirl of smoked salmon, two pieces of toast and a salad. Why 40 minutes? Even I, the world's worst cook, could have managed it in less time. One of the eggs was perfect, the other was more like hard-boiled. The credit card connection didn't work, so we had to pay cash.

Our main concern, however, was that the place was full of kids running around and shouting; so much so that having a conversation was impossible. Just like a Mcdonalds. 

To be fair, the staff did keep coming around to encourage us that things were coming soon.

18869,1,1548720000000,"I recently was back in Las vegas for the 12th time in 3 years and found myself back at LVH. 
I have stayed everywhere in Las Vegas and have found this place to be be the best place for my lifestyle. I dont enjoy places that are too busy or have a party vibe and the LVH fits in perfectly for what im looking for.
This time I only stayed 1 night but for a few hiccups I was once again happy.
I got to Hilton at arounf 230pm and got checked in very quickly. The front desk people were very friendly as usual. 
After I got to my room I  got my only 2 hiccups. First I was on the 3rd floor...LAME! I paid for an upgraded room and was told my room was going to be on a floor between 22-29 I think. I didnt complain because unless you do something totally horrible I will just deal with it. Second and last complaint was that the view from my window was of the golf course which is okay but if you looked down all I saw was the dumpsters. Okay, not exactly perfect but since I wasnt going to spend alot of time in my room and was only staying 1 night it wasn't a huge problem.
I got to my room and it was nice. It suited my needs for the day and was very comfortable. I quickly got unpacked and headed for the pool (which conveintly happens to be on the 3rd floor) and sat down by the pool and just relaxed. The pool had maybe 20 people in it and was very quiet..just the way I like it. Stayed at the pool for about an hour headed back to my room to get changed again.
After changing I made a B line for the gaming floor. I decided I wanted to play some slots so I found my favorite slot (Goldfish) and sat down and started playing. I decided I wanted a few drinks and found my cocktail waitress (which she was amazing...forget her name tho) and ordered some wine. She came back very quickly and this girl was on her A game because everytime I was about finished with my drink she was there with a new one. I stayed at the slots for about 2 hours maybe moreand decided it was time to go
 with an extra few bucks in my pocket and a very satisfied patron.
After that I didnt spend much more time in the hotel since I was meeting some friends down at Ballys but when I returned later that night I was hungry and stopped in at Paradise Cafe and got something to take to my room. I ordered an omlette with coffee. The omlettes there at Paradise Cafe are always great and the coffee is probably the best coffee in town. If I wasn't staying at LVH I would def make a special trip just to get coffee. I wish my casino had that coffee.
 After eating part of my meal I jumped into bed and had a wonderful sleep. The beds were comfortable and it was very quiet.
 The next morning I got packed up went to the front desk and checked out.
I lover this place. I have never had a horrible experience here. It's off the strip on the north end of town and its very quiet and easy to get in and out off. The atmosphere is great because its a more mature clientle. I will def be back at Hilton soon but I hope I can get off the 3rd floor.",2
18878,2,1546646400000,"I definitely do not recommend going to this doctors office. I had my second visit there yesterday as I was suffering with some skin irritation for the past week. Not only did it take about an hour after my appointment time to get in the room, but I was greeted with very little respect. Dr. Brown came in a very hurried manner and yelled out to me ""What's going on?"" to me. There was no warmth in her tone of voice and she treated me like I was just nothing but another patient she had to see. Then, she starts asking me questions about the irritation but spoke to me with a very negative tone. Out of nowhere, she then asked me about my ADHD diagnosis I have had since I was a little kid and asked when I was diagnosed which I already told her in my first annual exam a couple months ago. She asked when I stopped taking medication for it and I said a couple years. ***She then had the NERVE to tell me well I noticed while talking to you that you seem all over the place and quite spastic. I think it might be a good idea for you to go back on your meds. I can refer you to someone if you would like. It's like I stopped going on them for a reason two years ago, why would I need them again?  I then replied, what does this have to do with skin irritation? She goes we have to consider everything in a general physicians office. 

She was so rude the way she spoke to me. I shut down for the rest of the session. No doctor, I don't care who you are, should speak to a patient like that. I felt demoralized. Overall, she just rushed her way through the whole appointment and I walked out of there in such disgust by the way this doctor treated me.

Other highlights include spanekopita, pretzels, fish and chips. 
Not such a big fan of the seasoned steak-fries; the seasoning is inconsistent and the fries are sometimes mushy. Waffle fries would make a much better match for their main-course offerings.

The potatoes were amazing, the kimchi was terrible, there was a large bowl of glass noodles, yummy pickled cucumber, a weird green squash (we think), anchovies (chewy but not too fishy), bean sprouts, and another with spinach or something dark green. 

The server put the water on the table for us to help ourselves, a smart move due to the hot and muggy weather outside. However, she was a bit slow for everything else, as it took a while for her to realize we were out of water, that we were done eating, and failed to ask if we wanted separate bills. 

I ordered the bimbimbap (not dolsot, hot stone, as it was hot outside) and my friend ordered the squid hot plate dish. Usually for bimbimbap, the white rice is underneath and you mix it up and eat, but my rice came on the side and it was purple/red bean rice. I like the stuff, but it was strange that I had to put in my rice. The hot sauce was left with me to decide how much I wanted to put in...it wasn't very strong so I had to pour in a lot. My friend complained that the seafood wasn't fresh and that there were some alright pieces and some not-so-good tasting pieces. However, it was just the right amount of spice. It took a while for the server to return with his rice, since the dish came with a bowl, but he was waiting at least 3 minutes (when usually rice is made in bulk, so it shouldn't take that long...)

Some things I noted: there was no ddeokbokki on the menu, the rice was purple, there were no napkins, nicer decor than my regular place (but that doesn't mean much).

All in all, an alright place. However, I still stand by my favourite Korean restaurant, just down a block or two!",2
18891,2,1547078400000,"Came to the show with a group of girls on a bachelorette party. We were really excited, some of us had been to drag shows before and others had not. Either way, per my past experience...it has always been such a good time and great entertainment full of energy. We had an issue with our server who was completely rude (to the point of purposely bumping into some of our group that might have been standing in her way dancing to the performers). We got served one round of drinks with waters...when our server became absent and we requested her three times the manager finally came up to us and told us the whole group had been cut off. I was shocked, a group of girls having fun and cheering on the performers get cut off in vegas at a drag show. In all fairness, we probably had about three girls out of 15 that maybe were drunk but they were drinking water...so cut off the whole group. When the manager came up to the bride and told her this the bride tried to defuse the situation and saying that wasn't fair, the rest of us were fine. After speaking to her, the manager agreed that since the bride seemed fine, she gave her a beer but wouldn't serve anyone else. Even me who was sober. I just feel this situation should have been handled way different. We are in Vegas, paying for a show that includes drink service. A group of girls enjoying a show get punished... it was so weird to me that I felt compelled to write this review. If I wasn't with a bachelorette party i would have walked right out. The waitress was extremely rude and aggressive and I wish I had her name, we did nothing to her and she just took out her bad day on a group of girls having an innocent good time. 
On a side note. I thought the show was great! We loved Pink & Cher especially. But what we thought was odd is after the show, the performers are outside soliciting their souvenirs and we came up to a couple and said how we loved it and they did great and how great they looked and they literately didn't say thank you to the compliments and pretty much looked like they wanted to be anywhere but there. 
The show was great but all we got was bad attitude and treated very unfair for customers who paid to see a show, just left a really bad taste in my mouth.",2

18924,2,1547769600000,"I purchased my ticket for a 10:45 showing of Star Wars Rogue One to go see it with my oldest son on my only day off this week. Having the reserved seats meant when I purchased my seats online at 3 pm that I was able to pick from just about any seat in the theatre. I get there, and someone else was sitting in my seat. I asked him if he was mistaken. He said no. I then grabbed an employee to solve the issue. She came in and checked the man's ticket. Sure enough the same exact seat was sold to him. She told me ""There was nothing she could do, and to find two empty seats"" only this is Star Wars Rogue One, so I sit down, and here comes a couple. I see the look on their faces as they approach me and my child. I asked them if I was in their seat. Apologized, and walked out of the theatre in embarrassment. I asked to speak to a manager. Another employee came, and told me he knew who I was talking about, and that they actually left and didn't share the same tickets and seats as me. He escorted me back in to sure enough empty chairs. I sit down, open my son's snack for him, and then the friends of the couple that I previously had talked to said that their friend is sitting there. 

At this point I get up, and walk out demanding to speak to a manager. I wait while the same male employee goes in and harasses these people about their ticket. He is about to kick them out even though I seen, and their own female employee seen them present their ticket with the same seat number as mine...now misplaced. I vouch for the guy even though he was accusing me of not believing him before. I inform the manager who now finally comes up that I don't want other paying customers to get kicked out. That I just want to watch this film with my son on my only day off, and to find me a seat...not make me search for one like the first employee did. He returns moments later to tell me he has several seats that are vacant, but not next to each other. I express that this is not ok. I am not having my 8 year old son sit away from me. He says he understands completely, and that he has two adjacent seats in the very front row. I ask then if I can have a refund. He disappears, and tells me moments later that because I purchased my tickets on Fandango that all he can do is give me free movie passes, but that these passes cannot be used for Star Wars Rogue One until January 2nd of 2017. He then is about to leave, and I ask him if its possible to get a refund on my popcorn, drink, and candy I got for my son. He brings me my change back, apologizes again, and then leaves. 

No extra compensation for my gas money of driving to the Orleans on my one day off. Having to be embarrassed multiple times, and then the heartbreak of explaining to my son why he cannot watch Star Wars with me tonight. I understand that this must have been a glitch in some way, but the way it was handled could have been done way more professional. 

As an employee of the Orleans for almost 15 years I am quite ashamed to even write this review as this is usually my favorite theatre to attend. I really think they need to get their act together when it comes to this new transition to the Recliner seats and reserved seating system, and definitely train their staff better on how to handle the situation.",2

However, from our party of 8, there were positive comments on the spicy pork and bolgogi.

The Positives!: I would come back just for the service. This place is very Korean. From the elder ladies with curly hair greeting you at the door, to the pictures or old Korea around the restaurant.

I can't say that this is the best sushi place that I've ever had, but this is my sushi go-to in the area. They don't take reservations at peak hours, but you can call ahead to get the approximate wait time and to put your name down on the list. They do get packed during busy hours and the wait time for food is way longer than other times - I won't ding that on the review because that is somewhat expected. (Just plan accordingly and be realistic with time). I always get 2 or 3 basic rolls, which are usually under $5 each. My favorites are the spicy yellowtail, Alaska roll, and the Xmas roll. Note!!! They cut their rolls into 6 pieces, which are WAY TOO BIG. So I always request that they are cut into 8 pieces, which are then normal-sized (to me, at least). Plus, it makes me feel like I have more sushi. If you like tuna, I'd highly recommend the Toro Roll. It is a bit more pricey, but uses scrumptious pieces of fatty tuna. Bold tuna flavor, presented in a simple roll. I also recently discovered the Toro sashimi, which is cheaper, if you just want to try the fatty tuna. 

I'd also recommend their boba (or bubble tea), if you are feeling a cool, sweet pairing with your food.

I also tried the Tonkatsu ramen a while back and was not impressed. The broth was not as rich as expected. I'd definitely try it again to see if anything has changed though.",2

After taking a moment to glance over the menu, we decided on the pita pizza app, the special (beer battered fish/Mac and cheese) and the fish tacos. 
The pita pizza: a soft pita shell with pesto, tomatoes, chicken and cheese. BORING. 
This appetizer reminded me of my mother's Irish cooking: tasteless. A simple addition of caramelized onions would have solved this problem. 
Entree 1: Beer battered fish and Mac and cheese. Ruling: BLAND. My husband ordered this one and described the fish as ""wet"" and the Mac and cheese as ""play-doh"". They also served the dish with lettuce, tomato and onion, as if it were a sandwich. 
Entree 2: Fish tacos. Ruling: OVERCOOKED/COVER-UP ATTEMPTED. Ok, so they weren't bad, but the fish was dry. Covered with tomatoes and a bit of lettuce, the tacos were, again, on the tasteless side. The attempt at adding flavor came with the chipotle mayo and sour cream. 
These only helped to moisten the fish. The corn relish was masked by jalapeño peppers and the rice came shaped as if out of a small flowerpot.

Starters:
Escargots - Never had them in a creamy like sauce, but this worked well.  If only I had... more bread!! Would've loved to sop that up.  A bit salty, but who cares.  I like cream sauces.

Salad - Nice dressing.  Can't complain.

Mains:
Lamb special - Good stew, decent flavor.  Good sauce.  Guess what I would've liked more of with a sauce like that?

We tried brownie swirl, strawberry butter milk, mint chip, honey lavender, Belgian chocolate, and basil lime sorbet.
  
 Maybe the higher temps brought out a lot of people for ice cream today. Maybe the crew was tired because they had a lot of business today. For which I am glad! I like to support local business. The reason I'm giving them four stars (actually 4.5 but they don't have that on the scale )instead of the normal five stars, is that the customer service was a bit lax today.  

There was a mix up when a server told the group behind us to come up to the register to pay because they said they were done choosing. The person then adds another milkshake on to their order, at the register. Our ice cream is scooped, sitting there and they start adding in our stuff to this other party's order.

Then the cooler for a drink of water  for self- service was empty. It was mentioned to the crew and they refilled it about 15 mins later.

 My sorbet got  flavored with chocolate at the bottom of the cup. It made it taste weird.  When I nicely pointed it out to one of the servers, instead of saying sorry and readily replacing the scoop, I received a clipped, snippy explanation why it happened.

We stumbled upon Hopdoddy while waiting for a trendy brunch spot a few doors down in the same strip mall last weekend. Our wait for the brunch place was 'somewhere been 35 and 90 minutes' while sitting on a bench we saw Hopdoddys and decided to take a look. 

I'm glad we did. The place is clean, modern, and has a really cool set up. The menu sounded delicious and the photos on Yelp proved that this place was pretty solid. They had no wait and were offering a burger and a beer for $10.

The ordering is kind of strange, you take a menu from the host, proceed to order at the counter, and a server brings you your food, any drinks from the bar, and condiments. Speaking of condiments, the options here for dipping sauces are ENDLESS- aioli, mayo, sriracha, honey mustard, chipotle ketchup, ranch, and sassy sauce. Sassy sauce is their house sauce made out of mayo and secret blend of sorcery and magic that makes it truly delicious. I recommend it. Beers are served in a large frosty chalice. Our server Glory was attentive and awesome. Made sure we never ran low on Sassy sauce. 

Now the REALLY good stuff: the burgers here are phenomenal. I had the daily special which was the Chicken Fried Steak burger - two beef patties breaded and fried with horseradish mayo and house made pickles. This burger was life-changing. I have never had anything like this. Easily one of the greatest burgers ever built. I am going to start a SuperPAC, an online petition, and engage Russian hackers to help get this burger put on the menu full time. It was just THAT good. Hopdoddy management, if you are reading this, please please please but the Chicken Fried Steakburger on the menu.  I'll get your restaurant name tattooed on my body somewhere if you do, I promise! 

The green chili con queso fries were insanely good, too. Word of caution, the portions for the fries here are HUGE. But that's not a bad thing. In fact, that's a very good thing.

Now the charge came thru on my phone at the time of 5:22 so total time from phone order to pick up was a half hour.  By the time I got home (less than 5 minutes from the location) the pizza was so cold we could not eat it nor the bread that came with it.

I promptly called and asked for the Manager and was given Jason.  I explained our situation and was promptly told that it had been sitting there an hour, when by time proof it was 1/2 hour total time, call in to pick up.  I did not call for anything but to give a heads up about our situation.  The call ended, no thank you for calling, nothing.  He just hung up on me.

Uniquely, Jason's name was on the receipt we have with the time stamp.

Although we have been going to Nello's since we moved down the road  over 2yrs ago, we will be driving farther into chandler to Floridino's due to the poor customer service we received today.

Well, i dont know where to start ! 

I have read all other nice reviews and really am not for bad reviews... but..... 

I have to say, i have never, ever seen such bad service and unprofessional peoples in a same day. 

My wife scheduled an appointment for a leaky dishwasher (leaky means water leaking underneath and your socks being all wet because of it). 

The technician (Ryan long hair with a cap on and yawn every minute) who could not detect the leak, will start yawning and sighing after 5 minutes checking at the dishwasher. 

Do not talk to him or even raise a concern, he will sigh again, laugh and treat you with the most condescending  attitude a 13 years old would do !

If your problem is intermittent, well be ready ! Because Ryan has limited patience and will act like he is on drugs, pretending you are yelling at him ... all this without ever looking at you in the eyes...

Be also ready to have him yelling at your face ready to assault you (yes assault you) if you say anything about his attitude !...

And if you dare calling the owner, he will hang up on you after saying that he does not understand as the person you refer to is a very calm person ( Ryan a calm person ? Really..? we have not met the same Ryan then... )

I totally understand how a business work ( i own one) and how frustrating it is not to come up with answers when other jobs are waiting.

19067,2,1547337600000,"I drove past this place last weekend when my man was dropping off his bike at the BMW Motorcycle shop... anyways, my point being, it's kind of hidden away, without major traffic passing it by, so I wouldn't have known about it otherwise... 

I called that day and was able to get an appointment with Hannah. At first I just thought she had an accent, but then she told me she was hearing impaired, and since she only reads lips, wouldn't be chatting with me during the cut so she focus on my hair. 

I personally LOOOOVED this. I hate when people I don't know feel like they are forced to make small talk with me for an hour. I don't care about your kids, or your boyfriend, and I don't really want to tell you about my life either... Just do my hair, and make it look good. (sorry if this sounds bitchy, but it's sooooo true, and I know I'm not the only one out there) So anyways, right off the bat I freakin' loved her! 

Now onto the cut. Very good. She worked fast and efficiently. Took my lifeless, split end, damaged hair, and make it look healthy and shiny.

Style/Blow Out - AMAAAAAZING. This is after all what they are known for. I have thick curly hair that I always blow out, but then that needs to be smoothed out with a flat iron. Not Hannah, somehow her magic worked and when she turned the chair back around, my hair was flawless! I was seriously impressed.

I would definitely recommend Hannah to any of my friends!!",2

I like irish pubs and this one is not bad.  The Brocach's beer was good and the irish whiskey collection tempting.  The brats that I ordered were also good, though if I was to do it again or offer any recommendation it would be to ask for the apples and sauce to be on the side as it overwhelmed the other flavors.  Just the same for $13, I can forgive quite a bit.  Then again, I would have been happy to pay more should it have inspired the wait staff to be more welcoming.

I walked up to a bar and told the bartender my room number and asked where the elevator was. He informed me the Flamingo has no guest elevators and I should go to Caesars and use their elevators. What?? I have a room in the Flamingo. Not Caesars. I'm angry even sleeping here tonight but it's already paid for. I walked maybe 20 ft to the next bartender and asked them where the elevator was. It was literally directly behind the bartender that told me they don't have elevators. I'm livid. I now can't stand this place. I have video if the management would like to see who it is. I know his name starts with a T. I'm unfortunately here for 3 nights. Never again. Lesson learned. Stay somewhere else where the employees might care just a little bit to at least tell you the elevator is directly behind them. I'm so insulted. This guy lied to me obviously for his own joy. Unless this was his first day and no one said ""turn around, there's elevators directly behind you."" I shouldn't jump the gun. Maybe it was his first day and he never actually turned around yet and whoever trained him never let him know the flamingo has more than one floor. Whatever the case may be, if a guest asks where the elevator is, maybe don't direct them to a different hotel when all their belongings are already on your property, in a room they are already having trouble finding, that's already paid for. But I guess you already have our money. So who cares, right?",2
19106,1,1546387200000,"Wow.  Hands-down the absolute best dining experience I've ever encountered at any restaurant, and the food wasn't half-bad either.  We came here for a delicious Sunday hangover brunch, and after about a 20-minute wait sitting down near the bar and being tempted by bloody marys, we were promptly seated.  Our server made meaningful and thoughtful recommendations, and was patient with even the most indecisive of our bunch who flip flopped on his order more times than John Kerry.  Between the five of us, we ordered two Croque Madames, two Kobe Beef burgers, and one French toast.   

We also wanted strawberry milk, but they happened to have run out for the morning. HOWEVER, upon seeing our disappointment at this news, the server sent out a creme brulee and a chocolate and vanilla cream with cookies, ""compliments of the chef."" Thanks dude!  He also didn't charge us for the juices and coffee we ordered, which was a pleasant surprise on the bill.  In the end, the food itself was good - not spectacular, but the entire experience from the moment we walked into the time we left earned this place a 5-star rating.  And, we got out of there for around $30.00 a person including tip, which was less than a big bet on blackjack.  Score!",2

The staff was also wonderful and very helpful.  They answered all of my questions and gave me recommendations, as well.  I also had multiple questions about juicing and the girl helping me took her time to explain how they are all made and which juice she would recommend since I had never juiced before. I did end up grabbing 3 of the pre-made juices from the fridge and when I asked her if they would be okay until I got home (I had to run errands and I knew I wouldn't be home for a couple of hours), she went above and beyond and asked if I would like some ice and even made a little cooler out of the drink holder.

19128,2,1548028800000,"I am not that big of a Prime Rib fan. 

I guess I don't understand why Americans in droves are so enamored over a large slab of tasteless beef that costs $30? I have had my share through the years, but I prefer a Filet Mignon, Porterhouse, or NY Pepper steak instead. I think the best part of Prime Rib is the Horse Raddish!

But Lawry's can make most people a fan, because they do it well. They employ the large metal table-side carts, just like House of Prime Rib does on Van Ness in The City. 

They have at least 5 different sized cuts, from small, sliced, medium, large, and super-large in-bone. The most popular is the Lawry's Cut. This is $37, but comes with their tasty, chilled Lawry's Salad, mash potatoes, and bread pudding. You can order optional sides of cream spinach ( I recommend it, it is good) or corn. You are served warmed sourdough -like bread before the meal.

We started in the bar, having 5 of us after a trade show cooling down over cocktails, and talking shop. They have great crunchy potato chips in the bar. You are seated by a hostess when your table is ready, served by a waitress, and a separate chef carves up your meat and plates it for you, table-side

4 of us ordered the Lawry's Cut with a side of creamed spinach. The fifth order the one increment larger Jim Brady Cut. It is a lot of food, especially after we started with 2 plates of calamari appetizers to split, which came with a tasty Chipotle spiced Aoili dip. 

The service is great, the food is very good, and the ambiance is nice and relaxed. 

Lawry's on Flamingo in the Hughes Center between Paradise and Las Vegas Blvd (the strip).

PS - with the Lawry's seasoning and only USDA Prime cuts, this is good Prime Rib. But my favorite part was still the Horse Raddish!",2

I like to come here with my girlfriend because the booths make me feel like I'm in a private place. The restaurant looks like it is brand new and I enjoy the music videos that they play on their projection which is a mix of Korean, American Pop, and some funny ones like Boy Dance Party from SNL. If you get Kristin as a server, you're in great hands! She is very helpful at suggesting food items and checks on our table at a consistent rate. She actually looks like she enjoys her job and enjoys serving you . The staff has always been attentive with my water also as I am a fast drinker. Their servers speak fluent English too 

My usual order consists of brown rice, kimchi (free), salmon jalapeño poppers (sooo good), 2 orders of toro beef and 2 orders of pork belly. The owner is friendly, and willing to help out with anything .

Our server was Michael, a lovely gentleman and self -proclaimed foodie like us. We started with foie gras, Dungeness crab cocktail a dream berry and lemon drop. We ended with butter cake and key lime pie, in between was a New York strip Oscar style which was tender and flavorful in every bite. Halibut, more dream berry, and neat shots of glenlivet 15 year chased with pelligrino. No complaints whatsoever, but everything is a la carte and very rich, like maybe they should offer complementary heart surgery instead of after dinner mints rich.

- The menu is funny.
- There are a fair number of vegetarian options which are clearly labeled
- The onion rings are amazing.
- The portions are large, you can get more than you fill for a good price
- They have root beer floats!
- Our server was hilarious, you know that self-deprecating kind of humor

The salon is contemporary and clean. When you walk in there are couches to the right and the price board to the left. It was a little odd that the ""front desk"" is actually in the way back. Once I signed in, one of the threaders sat me down and asked if I wanted my brows done. I told her, ""no thanks, just my lip"" and she asked if I was sure. True to most salons, she tried to upsell more services but she wasn't pushy or aggressive. Truthfully I've never let anyone touch my eyebrows and I wasn't ready to start today. She was quick and thorough. No left over hairs or skin damage. Well worth $5.",3

One thing I really enjoy, is my monthly re-program, where I meet with a trainer and see where I stand compared to the month before. 

In the past year I have worked with several different trainers, and they have all been very knowledgeable. I am currently working out with Elizabeth and she is the best!!!

The class selection is decent, and I rarely miss the Tuesday night ab class.

For parents- they do have an on-site daycare, so you can bring your kids to the gym worry free.

I had an opportunity to spend time with the folks that run this bakery.  They are awesome people and more importantly, they are using their grandmother's recipes for EVERYTHING!!!!  They do not want to buy prepackaged or pre-made mixes, icing, etc.  Everything is homemade!!!!

This was angel hair pasta with ""fresh"" veggies, olive oil and parmesan.  It came with garlic bread and a side salad.  The salad was simply iceberg lettuce with several slices of tomato and a lot of slices of red onion.  

The entree was overcooked angel hair pasta, frozen peas, they claim fresh carrots, broccoli and mushrooms, but I don't believe it.  They didn't taste fresh and the mushrooms were slimy.  The overall dish had no flavor.  It came with garlic bread that also didn't have any flavor.  

Now for the positives.  The pizza we ordered was very good.  The wait staff was polite and reasonably on top of things.  

I would have preferred if the management had taken my entree of the ticket, but they didn't and I did't feel like arguing so I'm glad I had a restaurant.com gift certificate to offset my entree.

19215,3,1547078400000,"Even the local Montrealins love this place!!  AMAZING food, fast courteous service, and fun bistro atmosphere.

My husband spent our honeymoon in Montreal and as world travelers and food snob(speaking of myself), I had high expectations of the foodie city. After two weeks, many meals, and some home cooked, Olive and Gourmando was my FAVORITE meal and bistro!

Let me start off by saying the night we ventured in, a sewer main broke a block away thus shutting off the bistros water supply. In mid chaos, any reasonable human would understand to be greeted by a frazzled and short host. Contrary to that, the manager calmly explained the situation and offered to let us stay for a Sandwich. We had been walking all day and needed to use the toilet (which of course was out of order due to the water shut off.) We decided to come back for lunch two days later.

And that may have been our best decision the whole trip! I ordered a cappuccino and a simple bowl of tomato soup. Let me start with the cappuccino. If you've read my other reviews, I'm a coffee snob. I am appreciative and polite but, I will not drink a bad coffee. This espresso was dark and smooth! To add some twinkle to my good impression I saw the barista ""testing"" the machine making sure the espresso tasted exactly how it should.

The tomato soup was both rich in texture and flavor, creamy and fresh! It was topped with a feta, parsley pesto.  SO GOOD! Just the bowl of soup was filling enough and packed with warm cozy flavor.  My husband got a Rueben panini. Again, the best Reuben I have every tasted-and I happen to not be big on meat! It was perfectly balanced between salty and savory, piping hot filled with gooey cheese and fresh crisp home made bread. Yum! Of course, it doesn't help that these are all fresh ingredients as its Montreal, practically France!

We took dessert to go to enjoy later on our travels. As someone who lived in Italy, I fond memories of chocolate filled brioche. :) Either I was brought back to a state of ecstasy, or it really was the best Chocolatey Parisian pastry I've eaten. The only con I have was I shared it with my husband. 

I really do enjoy this bistro and will say one last thing- they are very welcoming to tourists. So put on your best French, our at least a big smile with your English and go eat some amazing food.",2

-It's a cool little salon in the basement of another business. Funky! 
-Coffee. The coffee is amazing! 

My story: I was nearly an hour late for my appointment [I know, I know!]. Blame a major car rental disaster, coupled with bad traffic and someone hacking my bank account for that one. But they handled it wonderfully and still managed to accommodate me that day. While I'm sure that's not possible all the time - and I certainly wouldn't rock up late intentionally - it demonstrates that they really do go above and beyond for their customers. 

They were really sweet about it AND didn't rush my appointment at all, even though they would have been totally justified in doing so. Rachel; you're a legend! My cut was the first in a long time that actually kept its shape weeks after being cut.

19278,3,1548892800000,"I stopped me here after learning about it a few hours before on Yelp.  I was trying to find a place downtown so that I can meet up my play step-dad ...lol, he was out in Phx on business (my mothers boyfriend-they have been together forever and a day) I thought what the hell let me check this place out. I love that the location was downtown. I am never  in downtown Phoenix on a Friday, so I thought it would be hella busy. Well well, it was hardly nobody down there. I guess I am use todowntown in Chicago (use to live there for some years before moving to Phx) or Los Angeles (grew up there, because these downtown cities are busy all the time. 
Well, when we arrived there was no wait, well I did may reservation on Open Table, but still even if I hadn't we still would have been seated right away because it was not busy. I would guess if there was a game going on that day, it would have been a different story. Anyway, we ordered the pretzel bites with cheese, I thought it was good because I was hungry but after a well I found that the cheese was to heavy and thick for me, but still alright.  I had the jambalaya it was cool. I did enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant. 
I just was not blowed away by this restaurant at all. It was not bad, I am just not sure if I will ever come here again. Maybe if I am downtown one day.
I believe I was more blowed away by the simplicity of getting downtown and just hanging out down there.",2
19281,2,1546387200000,"Well I missed the $10 burger and a beer promo they have going on, but I didn't need that for lunch anyhow.

I don't understand why their tables are so high. I mean I'm 5'3"" I get it--I'm not tall but when I sit in their booth the table is like at my chin.  I can't even imagine what little kids have to deal with. I almost asked for a booster chair if I would've thought my butt would've fit in it [should've tried anyhow]. Strike 1

When we originally sat down it kinda smelled like cat pee, so we asked for another booth by the window-it was THAT bad, that one smelt much better; however, I was still chin deep in table.  Not the most comfortable way to eat lunch. Strike 2

I asked if they had a calorie menu so that I could at least try to eat healthy, they did not. Strike 3 next batter.

Our waiter was a little behind so another guy came over to take our drink orders. By the time he was done our waiter came over and took our order but basically asked all the same questions twice. So that was kind of annoying but we made it happen.

What saved this place today [otherwise the stars would be much lower] was the food. I got the chicken tortilla soup [no tortilla strips-extra limes] and the fish tacos, ancho cream sauce on the side.  Both were delicious and actually pretty healthy [soup is like 300 calories 12 grams of fat, tacos 550 calories not sure how but 26 grams of fat? according to their website] minus the sodium which is super high in both.  I think next time I'll go with the plain old grilled fish.  My meal with drink was under $13.
whoohoo

When we left we inquired about their happy hour apparently it's 4-6 M-F but she couldn't tell us what nights or times the steel drum band guy played Strike 4.",2

19292,3,1546819200000,We have eaten at 1900 several times. The service is always stellar. The consistency and quality of their food is what brings us back. The problem that I see is food temperature. We have sent entrees back because they were just warm. Tonight our waitress brought our plates to the table using the OVEN MITTS; telling us the plates were very hot. I could pick up the plates with my hands! The food temperature was palatable. There is no reason why these plates (food) do not arrive at the table absolutely steaming hot! We will be back but if my food comes out any temperature below 140...it's going back!,3
19293,1,1548028800000,"Experience was beyond subpar. Food took an hour to arrive to the table. Some dishes were warm, while others were cool. Saag paneer tasted like frozen spinach mixed with Saputo mini bocconcini. Butter chicken was a putrid yellow colour and the kitchen must have their own direct pipeline into the Redpath sugar plant because one bite of the sauce gave me immediate cavities. The waiter forgot to bring items but remembered to try and bill us for them. The one positive is that the naan was warm and fairly chewy. Normally, I'll try a restaurant at least twice before passing judgement. However, after my first experience at Golden I'm not sure if that second chance will ever come. Hence, the lowest i can give is 2 stars.",2

Rafael was standing outside and heard us talking about possibly looking at the menu. His warm personality enticed us to take a look at the menu. As we were looking we inquired about Carson's kitchen. He did say it was good but they didn't have many options, so we decided to stay. No sooner had we sat down and gotten water did he bring us out flautas to try and appreciate our business. He gave us the VIP treatment and we ended up giving him the option to order for us! Everything was delicious. We were all satisfied and felt very taken care of! As I am writing this he had dessert sent out for us. There is nothing better than feeling like you're taken care of and appreciated in a town that you've never been.",3
19305,3,1548806400000,"We came at around 2 o clock place was pretty dead. It is clean all the way through and into the bathroom. The service was alright and the prices were moderate. The entrees selection was limited and not what I expected from a big seafood restaurant. Their small hot plate selection is pretty good and where I made most of my selection from. The ahi poki salad needed a bit more seasoning help from us but the ingredients were really fresh and it had lots of tuna in it unlike many other poki I have had in Vegas. The crab cakes (2) were perfect the most moist crab cakes I have ever had. The fish tacos (3) were delicate, clean and fresh tasting. The baked mussels (about 10 small ones) was not overpowered with the mayo and spicy sauce. The waiter warned me that it was spicy. It was really good but not spicy at all. I believe the menu said it had avocado in it, I don't recall any avocado in it but I did not miss anyway. Spider roll was good. Overall I like that they were careful to not over season anything. All the ingredients were fresh and the meal was really light on my stomach. The total was $57 for the five small plates and an ice tea we were stuffed.",2
19309,2,1547942400000,"Honestly, I had fun at Blush this weekend because of the great group I was with. It's all about the company you keep and I think we could have had fun in anywhere.

So divorcing that aspect from my review, I have to give Blush a thumbs down overall. 

First thing: drinks are expensive even by LA standards. I got a cranberry vodka, a Jag and red bull, and a water for $35.

Second thing: the music kind of sucked. 

Third thing: towards the end of the night a friend and I sat down on a couch on the dance floor. She took off her heels for a moment and a staff person picking up empty glasses came up to her and told her to put them back on.

She did. Then he turns to me and says, ""Are you with these people?"" (pointing to 3 people sitting across from us on the couch). ""No,"" i said.

""Then you have to move. They paid $2,000 for this spot tonight.""

""Ok, that's fine,"" I said, getting up. (Please note there was no visible sign stating that the couches were VIP or for table service).

""Excuse me,"" he curtly said, waiting for me to actually step away from the couch so he could get by.

Why the attitude? I didn't argue or protest. I mean, we might not have gotten table service for $2,000, but I'm still spending $17 per drink in your bar. WTF.

One other strange event -- after ordering the drinks I was signing the bill when a man came up behind me and put his hand over the drinks for a minute. He said something and walked away and we noticed he had put two new straws in our drinks.

We decided to err on the side of caution and not drink them. Told a bartender who asked to see our receipts, and then dumped them out and poured us two new drinks.

Overall a strange night. It was better than nothing, but if I have a choice I'd rather party somewhere else next time.",2

19310,3,1547078400000,"One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. My mother loves shrimp and this ruined her 80th birthday celebration. We arrived around 4 PM on a Saturday to avoid the crowds. The hostess did not smile or say hello and rudely told us that a teppanyaki table was not available until 10:30 PM even though there was a table open the entire 1.5 hours that we were there. She told us to sit in the corner of the dining area, but did not walk us in. There were no waiters or waitresses working in the dining room. Why have your restaurant open if you are not going to bring in wait staff? We were finally served by the manager who made us feel that we were an inconvenience to him. Terrible food presentation with cold rice, sad looking salads, dried out, room temperature shrimp, steak and chicken literally thrown onto plates with some onions on the side. The sauces came late and the hot tea was not served. Would have sent the food back or left altogether, but I had a group of five very hungry people and pre-paid tickets for an expensive event that evening. The wait staff showed up around 5 PM which was way too late to salvage this bad experience. Terrible service and tasteless, dried out food in an environment lacking any ambiance all for $30 per person. We eat out a lot and will never come back.",2

However, others have ordered the Walabi sub and liked it, pretty good burgers, and the Reuben is HUGE (and delicious!)

I watched the bartender stand around and clean cuz the order never even came in. Pretty sure my server forgot and a spark went off when I kept eyeing her every time she passed.

Tacos were pretty bland and dry. Was kinda annoyed I paid $3 for one ear of corn but actually was really good and totally worth it. The drink menu looked good too.

Overall I'd never eat here again, however id probably come by for happy hour or something like that. Never for a meal, not that type of place in my opinion.",2
19318,1,1546300800000,"Food & Drink
- I always get a benedict or poached egg dish for breakfast, brunch here was no different. The eggs were poached perfectly just the way I like them. 
- They don't use hollandaise sauce on the benedict, which I would have preferred, but their sauce was also nice and creamy, but not the taste I'm used to. 
- A side of fruit and potatoes are included - but not much as the benedicts are pretty heavy in themselves. The potatoes are cooked in duck fat and taste divine. 
- The benedict comes with a fresh glass of OJ, I LOVE FRESHLY SQUEEZED OJ!!
- Latte was good

Once she started dying it , I was told that if I wanted it blow dried it would be an additional $15 dollars. Never in all my years of getting my hair done have I been told I would have to pay to have it dried. So I declined and told her to leave it wet. She dried a tiny strand to see how the color came out. Well once I was home and it was dry, I was horrified. There is a thick bright red stripe down the center of my head, followed by white and orange stripes. There are random blotches of white, bright red and bright orange. Unbelievable!

I do not know how you dry out chicken thighs but they did, not juicy at all. The flavor is average at best, does not seem as if there is any spices and is quite bland for a ""special marinade"". They do give you seasoned salt (with a spicy option) that does improve it but why not serve it that way? I also ordered the gizzards which is why I went with a 3 and not a 2 rating. I have not come across them here in town. Again very average flavor and nothing special. The gravy that they are served with is the same.

When I got into the theater there was a woman sitting in my seat when I asked her to move she told be someone was sitting in her seat so she sat in mine and would not move. So I left to get a ticket to the next 11:30 am showing. The staff did offer to have the person move however I felt that would be more disruptive so I just changed my ticket. After I walked away from the desk one of the staff members did approach me and offer a free popcorn voucher which was a nice gesture.  When 11:10 came I got my concession items and headed to the 11:30 showing in theater 8 and got settled, and everything was going great until about 11:52 am then the screen goes black while the movies audio track continued to play. At 11:56 am I got up to find out if the staff knew of the issue. They informed me that the entire suite of theaters 6-14 all had blacked out screens and that they were going to attempt to reset the movie. At this point I had already had a poor experience with the new Camelview location so I just wanted my refund and was ready to go on to my next task for the day. I know that things happen but for a $14 charge for a show before noon I expect better. And I was no longer in the mood to watch the film.

It always tasted fresh and wasn't greasy. However, tonight I decided to try their new California bowl. I was expecting it to be somewhat similar to Chipolte's burrito bowls. Well . . . the concept was, but in reality it was not even close. The rice was clearly over cooked as it was all mushed together and had no flavor. I assume it is called the California bowl because of the guacamole. However, the amount of guacamole was highly disappointing. Once I mixed all the bowl ingredients together, I couldn't even taste the guacamole which is the best part. I added chicken and again highly disappointed with how much chicken they added. I could barely taste that there was even chicken. Overall, the NEW addition to the menu was a huge disappointment. In the future, Chipolte will be the only place I go for a delicious burrito bowl.

On a side note, I was also disappointed when Rubio's stopped carrying carnita's. They have two strikes against them in my book.",2

I have to say that Emilio, the owner of Izzazu is the consumate professional when it comes to customer service and follow up.  After my first appointment - at that time to be my last appointment - he doggedly tried to contact me to make the first appointment right.  Emilio and I had quite a lengthly and productive conversation.  He cares very much about making the customer happy AND correcting the situation that was unsatisfactory.  

I did go back and was very pleased with my cut once again.  Because Marshall was running late (20 minutes and counting) Caesar cut my hair this time.  Another great cut!

Again, however, the desk needs training in customer service.  After a 20 minute wait, the receptionist still hadn't notified Marshall that I was there.   A downtown salon depends on clients who are on their lunch hours for the most part.  Next appointment I'll call ahead to see how they're running before heading to the salon and waiting.

19430,1,1547596800000,"First off, they have a parking garage literally right next door and they'll give you a ticket discounting your parking $1.50! 

Went in around 9:30, so it wasn't packed at all. Ordered the Hangover Burger and the bf went with the chicken & waffles. My burger came with an over easy egg cooked perfectly, oozing out when cutting then burger in half. The burger itself was delicious. Bacon was crispy, the house sauce was tasty and the fries weren't too oily/salty either, no regrets going with the burger (even though it was breakfast). 

Also got to try a piece of the chicken & waffles which was fried nicely and the waffles were fluffy :) 

Would've given the place 4/5 since the service was mediocre, but the food made it 5/5. Definitely will be back if I find myself downtown.",2
19437,3,1547856000000,"This place is stellar. Great sausage, *amazing* fries. Nearly everything on the menu (except the obvious beer) can be done gluten-free rather easily, and nothing with gluten gets fried in the fryer. The staff is awesome and extremely helpful about answering questions.

If you're gluten-free, get the sausage curried instead of with a bun. You're not missing out -- the curry is excellent.

Order the duck fat fries, too. I didn't know I was missing anything from my life until I tried these.

Good cider selection.

Maybe don't go here if you're vegetarian. I didn't check for veg options, but my guess is there aren't a ton.",3

19449,3,1547078400000,"@ It's a cow boy kinda, wester themed place, rhat you can get your Grove thing on and not really need a time machine, lol; over all, you can really have a great time when here at DND. They have two different areas, I only ever been in the front and yet the back looks big big and well, rock out, jk.

+ get their before 8pm and get in free and then they have half off drinks for a bit, so cool, way to save and still get your drink on and dance on; I think that's a great deal

+ two bar areas and people that walk around with shots $1-$5, a shot?.

+they have an outside area, where you can smoke and get some freash air, 
-no out side sitting.

+ have a big dance floor that has bar sitting around it and you can get on the dance floor with ease, as I think they have a while chair rape for 1one of their dance floor entrances

- -they do have a dress code, as it is a theme of Cowboys and around the western feel, so if you plan on wearing something sliveless and be a guy, you will be asked to leave or put on the jacket that made you feel like you are going to pass out; simply, it maybe sexist or kinda like WTF, and still, it's all part of the DND way, so if going got to be more streamlined for the whole back in the day...so they could be more open, and still a Coybow themed place.

/ the CS, it can be great and yet a little spacey, lol, kinda their to help and yet, their is a lot of drink making and liquid fun being ordered; so it has a lot to do with how bizzy and I think simply, it almost seems like the more you spend the more you get helped. Over all, other then that, they do CS, with a smile and well, it's kinda a means of what can happen at any bar, as I never been a service in a bar area so, the is a means of first come, kinda thing.

+they do, beer pong tournaments and have some kinda event going on that sure to be a DND delight and you are bound to have a fun time, plus, even if you want to just hang with friends they have pool tables and well, even when it gets popping their is always a sit some where. 

+ even a great place to have a birthday party, as I dont know what kind of means they have to a Happy Birthday and yet host or not; you will still be able to have your cake and dance it off the same day, lol.

+ the people that go their, are fun dn well, it's has such a culture to it that really, you will soon become part of the DND family and just start leaving your stuff as to watch your table and it will still be yours

Tip = when planing on dancing, make sure you dress in away that you walk out with what you walk in with; as I, been dancing and lost a necklace before; well, enjoy who ever got it and whipped to see if it was mine well, you got your answer, through silence. Lol

@over all, it is a fun place to go and dance and have a great time, as they have the able and they do to be a cowboy theme tell it gets latter and they start seeming like a club; as more cowboy in their early means of opening and then they, later on, when all the party animals come out to play, it will start getting a bit less country and a bit more rock n roll, lol

Simply, they are a well, worth it place to go and hang, dance and have a great time doing it

Tip = right by the Wok in, so they got great food and a great way to dance

+ they do have a kitchen and I can't say to much on that fact,  as I haven't eaten food from their, and still, 

+they have a live DJ.",2

I did not have fun. Bad ambiance, bad food, an bad service.  

We were seated on what seemed like a communal table inches away from other parties. We asked for a booth (saw at least 3 open). They told us 'only one booth is left and we have to save it. Ok fine.

We were served cat-foody sushi with hard dry rice. Grosser than grocery store sushi. Good thing the portions were TINY because I couldn't choke down any more. 

Overall the waitress was rude and stupid. She brought me the wrong thing once and NEVER brought my sauce. We asked to split the check and the idiot brought out two checks alright....she charged us both for the whole table! Oh and your TIP IS AUTOMATIC- I had to tip over 30% where no tip was deserved.

19467,1,1548201600000,"I normally don't do this, but I'm giving a 5-star review to compensate for the (too) many terrible reviews I've seen on this hotel. If you're reading about cockroach nests and paper-thin walls or terrible service, know that it's an exaggeration.

Compared to the newer hotels on the strip, this pink bird is losing its luster; it's a Vegas classic that's showing its age. The furniture is a bit shabby and it lacks some amenities like a fridge, but it's the cheapest hotel for its central location on LV Boulevard.

I've stayed here multiple times and the only real downfall is the bathroom, a bit small with mildew in too many places. The room itself is very spacious and many of them lack carpet. 

You can tell the cabinets and desk are from another era and the TV is small, but size doesn't matter if you're partying in Vegas.

It's biggest advantage is location; it's right in view when you come off the freeway and is within earshot of the best Vegas attractions like the Bellagio fountain or the Forum shops. In the summer heat, walking distance means a lot.

Don't let the bad reviews scare you off. It's the best value for your money on a quick Vegas getaway. For special occasions or romance, splurge on something else.",2

We sat at the bar and had awesome service. Nice, attentive, knowledgeable and visibly working hard. I ordered the fruity margarita and it was pretty good, nothing wrong with it but I generally don't do sweet... my own fault. My husband ordered the flight of bourbon... good choice. He LOVED them, was really happy with the quality. 

Food- we ordered two apps to share and that's it. We ordered the Sticky Ribs and Potatoes. Um I am still thinking about those sticky ribs. They were absolutely my favorite.. I almost liked the bowl. The flavors were spot on to my taste buds. Potatoes were also on point. They also served some complimentary bread with a special spread.... I never wanted the basket to end :) 

Decor was cute and current. Bathroom was a single and there was only one. It was clean though so I'm not that mad.

19484,1,1546560000000,"My husband and I went to Luchita's this past weekend and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We ordered the crabcake appetizer and the nachos.

The crab cakes were delicious. They were served alongside a bed of salad which had a sweet-vinegar dressing that complimented the crab cakes perfectly. Really, really good. We had originally tried the crab cakes at Taste of Hudson, and loved them, so we definitely wanted an order of those.

The nachos were fantastic. I am not kidding, they were some of the best nachos we've ever had. Big crispy tortilla chips piled high with a really tasty blend of shredded cheeses, chicken, sausage, refried beans, tomatoes, jalapenos, sour cream and guacamole. We couldn't finish it all. I wish we could - it tasted so good. The chips were nice and crispy, perfect amount of salty-ness, and the cheese, chicken, beans and sausage were served bubbly hot, and topped with tomatoes and cold sour cream and guacamole. Perfect blend of crispy and creamy, hot and cold. Excellent! 

Our server was very nice, and we were seated pretty quickly for a Friday night. They were very busy, and the place seemed pleasant and clean. Had a ""fun"" vibe ... Lots of people talking and laughing .... Multiple TVs on in the bar area with various sports games on.


Overall, we really enjoyed our meal, our service was good, and the environment seemed clean, up to date, welcoming and happy.

19525,2,1547251200000,"I have been to this salon a few times and recently went back. They are one of the few really good salons that are open on Sundays, which is nice because it is my only day off. I have had great customer service and always walk out feeling fantastic with an amazing cut and color. The price is very reasonable and in my experience the stylists' ask questions and solicit feedback to make sure you are getting what you want. The cut and color is not very complicated on me, just some long layers and highlights, so I cannot say whether or not someone looking for something more dynamic or specific would have the same experience. 

What is really nice too is that they have laptops that you can use while you wait for the color to set in (limited number so you may not get one) and that helps break up some of the time. I noticed also that they offer wine, but you have to ask for it specifically, because it was not something they will directly suggest.

The service was however 50/50. We weren't greeted and seated right away. We had to go to the bar to ask for seats. However the drinks and food came quickly.",3
19543,2,1546905600000,"I again always have to preface this with my own personal background so that people understand where I'm coming from. I detest beer, or rather I can't seem to like it no matter how many I try. I prefer and can drink a cider and I'm also not a wine person but oddly I enjoy port wine. Why am I starting out with this is; Wvrst is most likely best enjoyed something akin to an Izakaya, which is beer with fatty, fried, and or salty food to compliment said beverage. 

Since we (my partner and I) do not drink I cannot give a review that would be able to connect with those that can appreciate beer so I apologize if I can't give more than just observations. This place has a wall of taps and a whole menu of exotic canned beers that are divided by colour as if we're wine and by other descriptive words, however I didn't pay too much attention. 

What we came here for was the game meat sausages. I have a lot of confidence that if they got the game meat sausages down that their traditional sausages must be just as amazing. I got the wild boar sausage which is a mix of boar, mushroom, and tea from how the menu describes it. The sausage was topped with onions and sour kraut (although I could not find the onions or taste them). The sausage was well cooked and it was juicy with the delicious animal fat that leaked out as you take a bite. The sausage is well seasoned but is complimented by the tartness of the sour kraut and the horse radish mustard I added. 

My parter got the Merguez, which is lamb and harissa and she got it in the style of currywrst. Which means that the sausage was cooked and cut up for you and served with bread and a tomato curry sauce. Now on the menu in house it just explains the currywvrst as I have and on the online menu it says in parentheses that this style is not recommended with game meats, and that double portions are available. We found that this might be the case because of the strong flavour of the spices in the curry but if the Merguez might be the exception (or at least for us it was). The spices that flavour the lamb in the sausage and the curry seems to remind us of a shakshuka without the egg. The curry is sweet, tart, and taste or the herby spices. 

We also got the pretzel with cheese sauce (made of Raclette and Gouda). The cheese sauce enhances the natural saltiness of the pretzel but doesn't make it too salty unless you eat a bunch of it bite after bite. Again seems like beer would be a good accompaniment but at least we had water. I also found that the accompanying horse radish mustard added another level of complexity to the cheese if you're okay mixing the two sauces. Oh yeah the pretzel is made really well soft in the middle but with enough of a greasy texture to hold up again the cheese and mustard sauces. 

We finished our meal with a salted rosemary and maple soft serve ice cream. Now I couldn't tell or taste any hint of rosemary. The ice cream was a well rounded flavour of maple because of the salt, that almost reminds you or caramel but with the woody earthiness that maple brings. I found it sweeter than my liking but because of the roundedness of the taste I ate more than I normally would. My partner said that the rosemary is very subtle and didn't too sweet but did acknowledge the sweetness. 

This place would get a five star from me but and here are my critiques. The portion sizes are small, in fact when the currywvrst Merguez sausage came out my partner didn't think it would fill her up. It was surprisingly filler (for her) but I would imagine this would not be the case for most people unless you natural have a small stomach or appetite. Despite the really well made sausage I don't know if it's worth the $12 price tag for the game sausages. The same applies to the pretzel with cheese sauce which ran me a little over $7.50. Btw not a pretzel shape. This is not to say the food doesn't warrant the price but it hard for me to see the size worth that price. But I mean it you understand, enjoy, and appreciate the value of really well done small portioned food available at Tapas and Izakaya you should be able to appreciate this. But if you're think I can get a bratwurst or Italian sausage on the street corner one block east for $3-5 than this is going to be a tough sell to your wallet.",2

This morning I wanted to go back so at 8:30am I called and good thing I did because it was going to be an hour and fifteen minute wait this time so they said to arrive between 9:45am and 10:00am and then I got right in despite their being many people waiting at the door.

I honestly can't wrap my head around a 45 min salad. 

The iced tea that my friend ordered, came AFTER the salads.

Then, as we sat there with our salad plates cleared and nothing on our table, we had to stare at the prime rib cart, that was right in front of our table. The prime rib was already cooked and in a cart, sitting right in front of our table...and it took 15 minutes for that to get in my mouth!

The staff is spot on with suggestions and somehow able to keep up with about 100 simultaneous and separate tabs going at once.  At happy hour, I had incredible Belgian wheat beer for about $3 and even the pizza wasn't bad.  

For the upscale beer they serve, the place isn't trendy or yuppie.  You go to the cooler in the back and just grab your own bottle or ask for a pour of whatever they have on draft (it changes often).  They even let you make your own six packs and walk off with them. 

The music is good, and not played too loud so that you can talk to your fellow pubcrawlers.  Highest endorsement.

That's ok, after a long drive we were just happy to settle down. Rooms are big and roomy. Our view was nice. I don't know why people complain about it when it's super cheap. You get what you pay for.

19602,2,1546387200000,"Let's start with the bad.

The jets in the tub weren't functional. The bath is huge and comfortable all by itself, but some jacuzzi-like action would have been amazing.

The water pressure in the shower is dismal, and the sensor is faulty. We couldn't get the water a decent temperature -- it was either super hot or really cold. 

The train. Oh, the train. Our room overlooked the tracks, and the noise from the horn blaring was unacceptable. If Trump knew that this was happening, there should have been better sound-proofing on this side of the hotel. My other friends didn't have this issue with their rooms, since they were on a different side of the tower.

Now the good.

The hotel itself is pretty.

There is no casino, so it's quiet and convenient to walk from the front up to the room.

There is a free shuttle that runs to the Wynn and to Caesar's Forum Shops (and to some outlets, I believe) every 10-15 minutes. We spent the majority of our time at the Wynn, so this was awesome. 

Room service at 4am was amazing. The chicken noodle soup was a group favorite. 

Although there were many positives, for the price, I should be able to take a nice bath or shower, and I should be able to rest peacefully without a train waking me up every night.",2
19603,3,1547769600000,"Oh, KJs... you have gotten good reviews in general, so we gave you a try--twice. We really, really want to like you.

First off, let me say that the owner?/server/woman who greets you when you walk in is very pleasant and friendly, so major points for that. :)

Otherwise, meh. KJs tries to be a lot of things to many people, with dishes ranging from teriyaki/stir fry to quesadillas to burritos to cajun food to curry. As a result, nothing excels. In our first visit, my partner had a teriyaki meal that did not reach beyond the level of frozen-dinner-heated-up, and which was so doused in teriyaki sauce that it was totally unappealing. We also ordered potstickers that were good, I suppose, but were overpriced for how few you get (4, if I recall correctly). On our second visit, he ordered a chicken masala that lacked the cream and complexity I have always found in that dish--the sauce was thin (liquid rather than ""gravy"") and the spices seemed one-dimensional and over... cinnamoned, perhaps? In both cases, my partner--a big believer in ""quantity over quality"" most of the time--didn't finish his food.

For my part, I ordered two slightly different, vegetarian curries in my two visits. They were ok, but also not as complex and flavorful as I would have liked, and they had very few vegetables in them (the potato curry pretty much was just potato). Additionally, neither of them came with any kind of protein (I wanted tofu); adding it was an additional $3, which brought the price up to closer to $13 or $14--pretty pricey for a semi-fast-food-style place.

Finally, the booth where we sat for our second visit had a chunk of base board missing, so there was a big hole in the wall and lots of visible drywall otherwise--a state that always leaves that question of ""what's back there?"" lingering in one's mind.",2

Also we can order sashimi salmon and tuna during LUNCH on weekends- a real bonus.

It was a fixed menu so perhaps that influences my review but there was nothing in the meal that had any flavour.  I typically expect when going to a decent place that there is some taste to the food so that I don't have to get my flavour via salt and pepper but sadly that was not the case here.  While the service was great and very prompt the meals themselves were very dull and uninspired.  Perhaps it was just an off night but others at my table also felt the same way.  With so many good places to eat in Vegas not sure I'll give this one a second chance.,2

They (Spooner) said they would call me back with the cost after they talked to my insurance company. They called me back saying it was a $60 copay. 

I went to two appointments and realized it was nothing more than a gym with less equipment. Then, I get a bill in the mail for additional money. Spooned is claiming it was just an estimate of $60 and insurance will not cover any of it. Now I am on the hook for the difference. This is poor business practice. If I go to a restaurant and the menu says a steak is $20, I shouldn't get a bill for $60 when I am done eating. They can charge you whatever they want and you have no recourse. I am glad I only went twice and not once a week for months like they recommended. Beware!!!!",2

We got a drink and watched people. The place was packed!  As everyone has written, the inside area was extremely loud. Maybe the management can get a sound deadening company in there, as everyone is saying the same complaint on yelp. On the other hand, people are waiting in line to get in, noise or no noise. 3 people in our group ate cheese burgers. All were very happy with the size of the beef patty, the bun was very nice, the sides were hot. Our hostess tipped over my friend s beer, on our table, as soon as she seated us. That was a rough start! They did the right thing and bought him a new beer. We didn't stay for dessert because of the noise. We went down the street for gelato's, so we could talk normally.

19679,2,1548720000000,"I'm giving this location a two star because the few times I've been there (morning, night, late night, afternoon) I've always gotten mediocre drinks/food. If you've been to the NODA location you expect pricey baked goods and tiny cups of coffee for the same price as a normal human-sized cups of coffee; you expect that. What you don't expect is burned- tasting coffee, hard macaroons, and food that barely deserves the name. I know they have trained staff properly but it sure does not show up in the product. 

The staff are normal Amelie's staff; the cashiers are bored, baristas are harried/ rude, bakery counter is goofing around but they're not the issue here. The issue is that every single time I've gone in, the TIMES OF OPERATION are totally different. Whether it's because they've just opened or it's the weekend or some other reason, it's never the same.

   Pahrump valley honey (large jar) - $24
   Croissant - $3 
   Pretzel breads - $1/each
   Broccoli/coconut/almond milk smoothie - $8
   Chicken tamale - $3

All in all you could probably walk the whole market in 15 minutes. I hung out... and sampled... and bought food and ate, while sitting and listening to a guy sing and play guitar.... Haha. Took about an hour and a half.

For 5 of us, we did have a wee bit left over to take home: We also indulged with two of the lightly battered deep fried tempura, Thai basil noodles, two sweet and two sour shrimp, and a bowl of vege in yellow curry.

19727,1,1546300800000,"There is no residential option for Time Warner Cable in York County and that is fine with me.  (Side note - Time Warner Cable and Time Warner have been completely separate, unaffiliated companies for almost four years.  Please don't insult the media company Time Warner by referring to Time Warner Cable as Time Warner).  Anyways, the only local cable option is Comporium, but their prices seemed high, and they also had a lot of additional fees when everything switched to digital.  We decided to go with Dish Network, and for the most part we have been happy.  It was my first experience with satellite, and overall, it's been better than cable.  

The price of the service is reasonable, but there are some fees added onto the $29 offers you see (they are usually clearly represented though).  The lease of the DVR is free; however there is a $6 fee for the DVR service (usually waived for the 1st year or two as part of a promotion).  Regional sports networks are an extra $6 per month (Fox Sports).  However, even when everything has been added up, it's still slightly cheaper than cable.  The best thing however is that we have had it for 3 years and our rate has NEVER INCREASED!

We had one issue where our DVR overheated and we lost everything recorded on it.  It was partly our fault as they are CPU's and need air circulation and we had some small items obstructing it.  They replaced it without and issue.  The service went out often at first but they came out and readjusted the dish and it's been fine since.  The customer service has been good.  Most often I have spoken to people in the US but occasionally will get an offshore rep.  We temporarily fell behind on our bills and they were very good about it.  On the few times I've had to call them I have not had to wait more than 5 minutes (and usually not at all).  As far as outages due to weather, they are few and far between.  It either has to be downpouring or snow falling (which accumulates in the dish and blocks the signal) for the signal to go out.  If you're worried about a 2 year contract, don't be.  If you are unsatisfied with the service, they are not holding up their end of the contract and you can cancel.  My main problem with Dish is that NBC Sports (formerly Versus and before that the Outdoor Life Network) is on their top tier.  It's a little too expensive so we don't get it.  Right now, however, they have a bunch of Starz and Encore movie channels for free for a year as part of an anniversary.

Overall, we have been much happier than Dish than with cable.  I cannot compare it to Comporium, but we have them for internet and they are good.  I'm just not sure I'll ever go back to cable.",2
19728,3,1548547200000,"Really awesome place!!! I had my shellac removed and bio gel applied by an older lady whose name I did not catch.

She tried to use an electric file to remove the shellac, which i was not comfortable with, so she switched to wraps right away, which i really appreciated.

She didnt do much about my cuticles. im not sure if thats just the process (i have never gotten a bio gel manicure before) or if she didnt think i needed it? maybe she forgot, but my cuticles are pretty well kept, so i did not really mind this.

holy crap, the woman can file! she didnt ask me what shape i wanted, but the nice even square shape i ended up with was so nice and so consistent across all of my nails! 

By the time the actual bio gel was applied, I was not at all surprised that it came out looking absolutely flawless. She even added an extra coat of color at my request. 

The place itself is not very pretty or spacious, but I have been to enough nice looking places with horrible manicurists to know that the quality of service matters way more. The manicurists mostly spoke among themselves in vietnamese (maybe?), but did not completely ignore me, which to me is the perfect amount of interaction during a manicure lol. The location is also quite convenient- but honestly, $30 before tax and tip for such a perfect bio gel means i would hunt this place down even if it moved to the deepest parts of Scarborough.",1
19733,2,1548892800000,"Walking into Qing Hua, straight ahead of you as you go down the front landing, there's a big sign above the service station that explains, on faux scroll-like paper, the history and tradition of dumplings.

I wish I'd read that sign the first time I ate here. Then I'd have known that boiling broth erupting from bitten dumplings is a total normal thing. And that you aren't really supposed take bites of dumplings. If anything I've become a gracious dumpling eater over time.

Dumplings are trendy in Montreal recently, despite having been around probably forever. I know this because out of nowhere during summer '15 every ""Where are we going to eat?"" discussion was settled by ""Let's get dumplings!"". Soon I was the one telling anyone who'd risk eating with me that probably we should have dumplings. Unless we'd already eaten dumplings say...two days in a row. 3 would be overdoing it. So you can't go wrong in early 2016 suggesting dumplings if you're responsible for lunch decisions at your office.

Oh yeah.. Qing Hua. It's hard to identify what's unique or different about this place compared the the multiple other dumpling spots in the area: The selection and flavours are the same everywhere. Menu prices are identical or within a dollar of each other. Every decor is the same shoddy thrown together pastiche of kitsch Asian emblems I suspect the owners would prefer not having at all but do it out of some expected obligation. The service in all these places is unpredictable and a toss up on any given day.

There's a chance dumplings in the 514 are a big cartel. A big yummy cartel.

I forgot to talk about Qing Hua again and we're many many words into this and you want to know whether to go or not. I can say that Qing Ha is named most frequently in those aforementioned lunch discussions, and it's packed and busy at most times, which I can't say for the other spots I've tried. Take that as you will. There's is however a  chaotic feel particular to Qing Ha that I suspect is due to inefficiencies or overwhelmingness. On this last visit our super nice waiter came and introduced himself twice, like he'd forgotten we'd been there over 20 minutes. I empathize. 

...eating suggestions! Share different flavours, mix fried and steamed dumplings, vegetable and meat varieties. Otherwise it gets bland to work through, i.e., it's hard to tell any of the meat varieties apart, and 15 steamed dumplings in a row gets pasty in the mouth quickly.

The doughnut was their coconut cream and it was divine.  I had to savour every bite, yes it was that good.  The cream had coconut shavings and the whipped cream was fresh.

The sandwich was served open-faced with an obnoxious amount of cheese. It was way too much to close and eat as a sandwich.

There weren't as many vendors present as I thought that there would have been at a ""food fest"", but all things considered, there was still a good variety of cuisines to choose from. The food vendors were split between two locations: indoors and out, with no clear indication that there was an inside section to the event. It was only when we asked someone where they got their drink that we discovered this fact.

The event wasn't jammed packed in the same manner that some of the bigger festivals in Toronto are, with most lines being five minutes or less. This is a welcome change.

One thing that left a sour note in my mouth was that this event was advertised as free admission with an optional $2 donation. When we arrived, we found that we had to walk through a ""gate"" with two tables set up in such a way that only two people could walk through abreast. To me, this implies that the $2 donation weighs less towards optional and more towards mandatory on the optional-mandatory scale (and in case you're wondering, yes, we did leave them a donation).",2

I came in at 9:30 and they close at 11:00. It's Memorial Day evening. Nobody there but one other customer when I came in. 
My massage was hurried through and rushed. She was talking on her cell phone while doing my head. Then she left 3 times during my massage for a couple of minutes at a time. Talked to other masseuses almost the entire first half of my massage and applied zero pressure when I asked her. The foot massage was a joke! Ripped over my bones a few times with her elbow which was painful and then only did compression massage through a towel in my back. Barely rubbed my neck. Did not do the whole 75 min. 
At the end ran off to the front desk. Another lady saw I was sitting there and offered  me a drink. 
When I went to pay, Brittany checked me out herself and told me the owner wasn't there to tend to things. She gave me some water. The whole thing was so strange.. and I always give a good tip. I tipped 12$ and I didn't even want to give that. Super disappointed! I have been here almost every week for the last two months. Never have I experience such unprofessionalism and left so tense.

19931,2,1547942400000,"This theater gets props for being locally owned. There are so few of those left anymore, so I appreciate the chance to patronize the little guy (at least some of the time). That being said, this isn't the newest or nicest theater around, but it's perfectly adequate. It's a bit old and outdated, but clean (including the bathrooms). Snacks are fine -- the popcorn here isn't as good as other theaters, but passable. And I appreciate that they give you free refills on both their large popcorns AND large drinks, unlike most theaters which only refill your popcorn and then count on you to die of thirst and pay for another soda. Uhhh, I mean...not that I'm ever gluttonous enough to eat a whole large popcorn and then get it refilled. Nope.  

Anyway, in my experience, it's never super crowded, which is nice (I don't particularly enjoy playing Elbow Wars on the armrest with some stranger sitting next to me). They do have stadium seating in a few of their bigger screens (usually used for the big blockbuster movies), but the smaller screens have the old-school seating set up (and those typically are used for the less popular movies).

Prices are about on par with other theaters, if not a bit cheaper ($9.00 for an evening show, $6.50 for a matinee).They also have a great special on Mondays...$5.00 for any showing with a free popcorn.They primarily show mainstream movies, but occasionally they will surprise by playing more limited-release films too (big shout out to Waterworks Cinema for being one of the first theaters in the area to screen ""Boyhood"" recently).

For vegetarians and vegans, they have lots of veggies available -- tofu, spinach, mushrooms, celery, cilantro, green onions, various types of noodles (rice, vermicelli, udon, etc.), seaweed salad, all very fresh. 

And of course, there's lots of seafood options as well. The flounder filet is delicious; I lost count of how many plates I had. It's especially good dipped in Ponzu sauce and sesame oil. The squid, clams, and fish balls were great as well. 

I used a RNG (Random Number Generator) to pick some items from the menu. #6 came up twice...Chicken Cake. I had no idea what that was, nor did it sound too appealing. It ended up tasting pretty good, dipped in Sweet Chili Sauce from the Chicken Wings. It's like Salmon Fish Cake Patty you find in Thai restaurants.

We had a Groupon & it appeared that everyone else around us did, too. 2 steaks w/ a bottle of win & a huge slice of cheesecake for $40 is pretty good, except that it turns out it was barely just OK.

Where hotels like the Venetian go out of their way to make your room a calm relaxing oasis that is sometimes hard to pry yourself out of, the Flamingo Go Rooms just make you want to party.

So this park has plenty of running room for the dogs, a nice aggregate walking path for owners, water source for dogs and generally many other dogs to chum up with yours.  There are several permanent benches for seating and a covered shade structure.  Plenty of trash cans to pick up after your dog with poo bags available or scooping tools.  I just wish more people picked up after their dog or assume they did and pick up a pile you see to make up for missing your own dogs.  As the poo situation was way better than past visits, I still walked continuously for 10 minutes scooping pile after pile.  

Bathroom facilities are located within a couple hundred feet from dog park in between the sports fields.

I'm not sure who is a bigger fan of Sunseri's between my mom and I, but she doesn't live in the city and frequently sends me on trips to get her pepperoni rolls. I've braved some pretty harsh weather conditions to get them for her, and if they weren't as good as they are I might think twice about making the journey. They are 2/$10 for the regular or $6 each, and 2/$15 for the atomic or $8 each. Carrying more than 2 pepperoni rolls is comparable to carrying a small child with as big as they are, so you seriously get a bang for your buck here.

During my last visit I was a bit under the weather and decided to try some of their famous wedding soup. You can get frozen quarts of the soup for around $5, and combined with a pepperoni roll you have a tasty and filling meal for less than $15! Usually I'm wary about trying new wedding soups out of fear of being disappointed, but Sunseri's had chopped chicken and little meatballs with one of the best broths I've tasted (aside from homemade, that is). 

You can't go wrong with whatever you choose here, and I'd love to try other items including their sausage and other Italian classics. Stop by Sunseri's next time you're in the strip, and you may even meet Mr. Sunseri himself as he frequently spends time around the shop, cigar-in-mouth and all!",2

35378,2,1546473600000,"As the 275th reviewer of a restaurant with a near-perfect score, it's safe to say that the numbers speak for themselves. I'll add my quick review though because it truly was THAT good. 

DECOR: Luxurious, dim cozy lighting, and a chic ambience. Not so loud that you need to scream to be heard.

STAFF: Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, and suggested excellent wine pairings for our meal.

FOOD: A sucker for fancy finger-food, 3 of us split an array of tapas including the house marinated olives (aceitunas), chorizo, coca de hongos (flatbread with black truffles, wild mushrooms, goat cheese, and herbs), queso frito (a fried cheese with honey, walnuts, and figs), albondigas (waygu meatballs with a spicey tomato sauce and manchego cheese), brussels bravas (brussel sprouts with aioli & chorizo) and patatas bravas (crispy potatoes with spicy tomato sauce and a fried egg on top). 

I know this sounds like an obscene amount of food for three people, but it really wasn't overkill at all. The dishes are actually quite small - as tapas tend to be.

Everything was delicious. The chorizo was maybe the only 'average' thing we got. The mushroom flatbread was decadent but light, the fried cheese was sinful, and the meatballs were AMMMMAZING. Seriously, order them. I definitely could have eaten the entire patatas bravas to myself too.

PRICE: It's no secret that Patria errs on the higher price point of Toronto dining, but I think it's worth it. You're paying for the experience of dining in a posh environment with attentive service and uniquely prepared food. I will definitely be returning and recommending to others.",2

I had trouble with distinguishing which meat was which, but I believe it was the brisket that was reallllly dry-corn bread was a bit dry also. Was really hard to eat. I found the fries were a bit too over seasoned for me but my BF loved them. The pulled pork was good and the ribs were awesome.

34343,2,1547769600000,"I had such a bad time the first time I was here I blocked it out of my memory altogether which is how I ended up here a second time. This time round the slow service and cold food at least made enough of an impression that i remembered to never go here again. On the upside, at least the sangria was decent.

The dining room was less than a third full but our sever seemed to have trouble looking after three tables. He was nice enough and enthusiastic but that doesn't mean much when the kitchen forgets to cook your order. Our appetizers showed up cold after an hour and a bit but a mixture of fear that I would never see them again and gnawing hunger kept me from sending them back. An hour after that our meals made the scene and were at least warm this time. Our waiter somehow thought that bringing us two waters that we didn't ask for would  make things better and salvage a tip. No dice.

My food was ok. It tasted like cooked lamb and the veggies were very fresh. As in, ""just taken out of the fridge and cooked five minutes ago"" fresh. Our appetizer would have been fine if it were warm when it showed up.

Now I know what you're thinking, ""Why didn't you speak up sooner, complain to the manager or just get up and leave?"" and I would have been within my rights to do all of the above. The truth is, I didn't notice how much time was passing because I was having a nice drink and good conversation. Does that mean this place should get a better rating? My lord no. I just know I won't be making the mistake of eating here again and hopefully I can steer some other people away too.

48153,2,1548806400000,"Not a full fledged grocery store.  It's more of an upscale corner store right off the Yonge-Bloor station with a below average sushi station, average hot food station and an absolutely KILLER salad bar.  

If you live in the area and need fresh produce for a decent price, you're better off going to the many Rabba's that are in the area (I think there are three or four).  Also, fruits and veggies aren't super fresh and I kind of expect that from Longo's.  Combine that with their expensive prices, the grocery section is more a 2/5.  

However, if you are looking for an upscale, custom made salad, skip Camros and come here.  It's a bit expensive (2.99/100 g), but the selection is amazing.  It's surprising that the salad bar can be so fresh, yet their produce section isn't.  They have all the regular greens, but also have tofu, string beans (love 'em!), boiled eggs, fruits, steak served cold, shrimp, really good salmon, etc.  So for quality of the salad bar, definitely 5/5, but it loses a star for price.  4/5

So for a quick, fresh salad and if you are willing to pay - come here.

I can honestly say that aroma has very rarely played such a large part in my most recent meals but this one was to die for! The polenta wasn't gritty as I've usually had it, the short rib just melted in your mouth and the tomato based vegetables complimented the beef and polenta perfectly! Finished the meal off with the meringue aux fruits which again just exceeded my expectations!

36580,3,1548720000000,"I admit that I like the Steak Chalupa's at Taco Bell and this location is the closest one to where I work. Usually I do the drive thru unless it's crowded and then I'll pop inside and order. Today I decided to try the Taco Bell App that they advertise with posters plastered all over the store and on commercials on t.v. I have to say, I was not impressed. The app was tough to use and after I finally got the order placed, I had to wait in the store.
First the app. Granted I'm not a computer geek but I've played enough computer games in my day to figure things out pretty well and this app is not very intuitive. I was impressed that I had a coupon good for $2 off a purchase of $10 (which is a lot of food for one person at TB!) but there were no clear directions on how to use it. Once I figured that out (you have to choose it first and then place your order) I had to figure out how to order what I wanted. That was a little easier but still took a few tries to figure it out. Finally got my order ready, went to check out and got a message that the coupon couldn't be used and read the restrictions....which I could not find. I'm guessing that the local Taco Bell wouldn't take them, so I had to start over.
Finally got the order placed (you might want to enter your credit card info at the very beginning through the application menu) and a screen pops up asking if you're picking up in the drive-thru or in store. I clicked on the drive-thru and received a message to wait on choosing an option until I'm close to or in the store. When I arrived about 10 minutes after placing the order, and based on the very long drive-thru line, I pulled over, clicked on 'In Store' and I'm here, and then parked. 
I went inside and there is a special line just for app placed orders. the gentleman behind the counter was very quick to ask if I wanted to place an order and I mentioned I'd placed it via the app and was just waiting. Then I waited....and waited...and waited...and watched all the cars that had been in line at the drive-thru, place and pick up all their orders before I got mine. I was all the way out to my car by the time I realized that I was supposed to get a drink with my meal, which was part of the ordering process, and had to go back in to get that.
The overall process will probably go more quickly the next time around but the amount of time that I spent placing my order, and then waiting when I got there, kind of defeated the purpose of the app.
I will say that I do like going to this Taco Bell location. The place is always clean, the employees are friendly (especially the lady that works the drive-thru window most days), and the food is always good. While it doesn't look quite like the commercials on t.v., it's a lot closer in comparison to what the burger chains show you and what's delivered. I also like the fact that when you eat in, you can get refills on your drink and top it off before you leave.
I gave 4 stars for the location and employees however, if I were to include the app in the overall review (which would not be fair), I'd have to give it 3 stars.",2
42183,2,1547424000000,"Went for our first time a couple weeks ago. A friend and I wanted to try indoor climbing just for the hell of it, and we're so glad we did. The staff is SUPER-friendly and helpful!  No joke, when you walk in, it's so easy to be intimidated by all the super-ripped climbers just scaling up and down the walls in their awesome shoes and techniques, etc. But the staff made us feel totally at home and explained that everyone on the walls has been in our shoes before. They seemed excited for us and genuinely passionate about climbing, and I think that's what made me cross the line from scared to safe and excited. 

I don't have any other climbing experience to compare this to, so I don't know if they're overpriced or not. 

Re: finding the place - they have a cool youtube video on the website that starts 2 minutes out from their location. After watching it, I didn't have any problems at all finding it. 

We've only done it once, but have made a commitment to go back again next week and hope to do it regularly. I doubt I'll ever attempt anything difficult, just doing the easy stuff is exhilirating enough. :)

Tips: Wear layers. Bring water. Bring slip-on shoes to wear when you're not actively climbing. Call at least a week in advance if you need a belayer. Take the beginner's class.  Trust your belayer, and fall, and fall early so you get over that fear and are able to reach new heights.  Happy Climbing!",2

It's a fun place.  I enjoy sitting in front of the sushi chefs and watching them work.  There are also several booths around the restaurant if you like that sort of thing.

The menu is extensive with sushi options as well as japanese dinner specialties.  I am always craving something spicy and the firecracker roll is one of my favorites.  Also the Firecracker shrimp appetizer is great as well.

I've found the wait staff to be hit or miss but the sushi chefs are friendly.   

There are two flaws here.  One it's two loud an two, I think they are a bit pricy.  But the food is wonderful.  I think I found my regular sushi place.",2

There is a private parking lot and a short walk overflow parking lot.

There is indoor and outdoor seating and dogs are welcome but only outside!  There a few TV's if you are dying to watch the game or golf .  Food trucks are available should you get the munchies.

Lots of great tasting beers such as the mild IPA ""Boot juicin"" and the ""The two horned unicorn"".. plus they have a couple of sours and wine.

There is plenty of room here to move about even when it looks busy on the patio.  

The only ""downside"" is that the bar and certain tables are very tall -- such that when you sit on the stool you will feel short --- now for me being taller I was fine but the majority of people may feel off or awkward.  There are picnic tables to sit low and normal.( Apparently the owner is over 6'5"")

They had some drinks you can buy on the side which are very tasty and not expensive as in some other restaurants.

The manicure and pedicure there are amazing. Definitely try the paraffin wax, it makes your feet super soft. They have an awesome variety of colours including nail polish that doesn't come off (I've forgotten the brand) but it truly does not come off.

The basic Margherita was perfect in its simplicity - perfectly blistered crust, perfectly melted mozzarella di buffala, fantastically flavourful tomatoes and basil. Bonus points to the server for upselling me on a great glass of Falanghina before my meal instead of the pinot grigio I was contemplating. The service was a bit slow and inattentive otherwise, though, and the environment a bit cluttered and uncomfortable.

Server suggested the salmon salad or the cheesesteak melt. She said the chef was amazing and everything he makes is delicious. We opted for the Cubano sandwich and the Italian Melt (I think that was its name?) The side salad was fantastic! Beautifully dressed large salad with strawberries, pecans, blue cheese, tomatoes red onion. Very yummy. The Cubano was so delicious. Rolled ham, pulled park, Swiss, pickles, and mustard ""sauce"" on griddled buttered Texas toast.I say sauce because it was way better than just mustard. The pulled pork was so flavorful which is an accomplishment since most pulled pork gets its flavor from sauce. This was not all saucy but very tender and delicious! The entire sandwich was amazing. My sister had the Italian sandwich also on griddled Texas toast and loved it. Her fries were plentiful and perfectly fried. Server was attentive but needed to spot our her chewing gum.

I wanted Indian food for my birthday and he found Mozen on the restaurant week listings (which I believe is over now).  The set menu offered 3 courses for $40.13.  I ordered that while my husband ordered some small bites from the menu so we could share.

There was not a single second, a single bite that I can complain about.  I had the Hokkaido scallops, which were an amazing combination of briney and sweet, followed by the chicken Makhni and a green tea dessert.  I ate every bite.  The sauces, the textures, everything, was perfect.  The chef paid attention to every detail.

My husband had a chicken dish, the salt and pepper calamari and some lettuce wraps.  He too ate every morsel.  I tried the chicken and the calamari - and then I stole some more calamari.  Again, very tasty.  

The service was wonderful.  The staff has found the right combination of attentive and invisible.  We didn't feel that we were being hovered over or bothered, but we never had to wonder where anyone was.

First - it's a hard thing to pick which direction to go in. Chinese, Japanese, or Sushi. I'm a sucker for flavored chicken so to have Bourbon, Mango, Honey Chicken and Coconut Shrimp to choose from would be too hard. The hibachi choices all sounded great as well, but it was the sushi that made us try it and the reason we'll be back. 

Large portions and great prices - the prices are almost too cheap, they could easily price these higher and we wouldn't hesitate to pay it. Their dinner hibachi portions even for shrimp & scallops combo is under $11 - a large specialty sushi roll is usually just about $9 or so, and the dinner combos for the chinese menu are only about $7.50. 

Big fan, nice staff, and I like that you can see into the kitchen and see that it is large, clean, and well staffed. It makes you feel better about the food, especially with the reputation that some other Chinese locations notoriously have. 

Only cons to this place is the parking can be pretty cramped but that is no fault of their own, and only one table (there is also a sushi bar with a couple seats) inside but just about everyone does take out so it makes sense. Keep up the great work, we'll be regulars now!",3

Vic is a friendly guy with a very good sense of humor and will talk with you as you're waiting in line for your hot dogs.

44675,2,1548460800000,"As a HGVCLUB owner I really loved this location in Vegas. 

Pros:
The 24 hour Starbucks in the lobby. Which gives refills on tea for .50cents

The studio rooms give a great view of the strip at night. 

Easy access to city center by walking. Also being attached to the miracle mile shops makes it even better. 


Cons:

Having to give your key to the elevator monitor to go up to your room. Seems a tad bit ridiculous. 

Parking can be a pain since it's attached to the miracle mile shops. Park on the far end of the 3rd floor to gain easier access to the hotel. 


Since I frequent Vegas this is definitely my new favorite.",2
25663,1,1548547200000,"Booked via Hotwire. 
5 stars. North on the strip. Excellent deal. Condo.

Alrighty, where should I start this review. Stayed here from Thursday night - Saturday afternoon. 

Basic Info -
No casino. A resort. Mini stock kitchen ( stove, fridge, pots, pans, salad tosser, glasses, you name it). Grand luxurious bathroom with a jacuzzi. Comfortable bed and warm cozy sheets. Sofa easily converted to a pull-out bed. Right behind Palazzo and Venetian.

Service -
When it came to delivering hotels and glasses, it was definietly lacking. Waited 5 hours for some glasses. Waited 1 hour for towels. Along with numerous follow-up and reminder phone calls. Definetly disappointed.

Security -
BIG MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. 

Friend #1 got super wasted and did not have the key to get into the room, so calls Friend #2 to call the front desk and ask for security to open the door. Friend #2 does not know who's name the hotel is booked under or any information such as credit card info, address, etc. After numerous attempts on guessing the address and slowly reading my cell phone number off her phone, front desk allows Friend #1 to enter the room. 

Granted that it was my friend and they were staying with us, you guys really need to enforce security and ensure the safety of your guests. It should be much more difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to be allowed into your room without the actual check-in person's consent. Had it been a complete stranger or someone else entering our room, you guys would've been in MAJOR TROUBLE. Extremley disappointed, Trump.",3

It's kinda like the Tardis in that it looks deceivingly small and basic on the outside but is really big and classy on the inside. Shiny floors, beautiful rose arrangements, and as you have probably read by now, a rose for the ladies at the end of the meal. i was sorely underdressed for the experience. The other places we've gone in town were much more casual. We went on a monday, I believe, and there was signage about drink specials or something during the football games, but none of the teevees were on. It wasn't why we went, so we really didn't mind. Our waiter took our drink order then stood there while we pored over the menu to decide what we wanted to eat...awk-waaaaard. But besides those things, the bread offerings were fabulous, the food was fabulous. I had the kubideh, of course. My boyfriend had a kubideh and another meat thing that I can't remember right now which was also delicious. A really lovely time. I'll be sure to dress up for it next time. ;)",2
39333,2,1548892800000,"Michelin Stars: 3 but I think the last year LV was Michelin rated was 2009. 

Let's start with the positive -- that ambience!

Seriously one of my favorite things about this place was the ambience. It's beautifully decorated inside and that adds to the experience overall. I had a couch seat next to the fireplace with lush purple velvet pillows. Damn I felt fancy. 

Service was good, almost great but not fantastic. The sommelier was a highlight though of the service; no problems there. As far as food, it was beautifully presented but is being out-done by others (Atelier Crenn comes to mind..). Quality of the dishes were magnificent but seemed a bit heavy on items with foie gras and gelatinous textures. A little more variety and balance could serve them well. 

Overall a tremendous experience. If you have the means and the fortitude (that bill was steep once you add the top level wine pairing - even for a 3-star), you should make the effort to go!",2
39333,2,1546646400000,"I'm from out of town so wasn't sure what to expect. The reviews didn't look promising but since I didn't get to pick where we ate, we ended up here. We had a very large party of about 25. They were very accommodating. I noticed that neither the restaurant or the bar area were busy for a Friday night. The bar area is separate from the dining area. There was a door separating the two like they were two large rooms. I'm not quite sure why, I've never seen anything like that but moving on...

The place is huge and has lots of seating even in the bar area. There's even a patio with a fire pit. Overall the restaurant is clean and spacious. That being said, the menu is short and nothing appealed to me or my sisters. The food is below average for bar food. We ordered the potstickers and the barbecue chicken flatbread. Neither of which were all that great. 

I will say that they have a decent drink selection. I'd stick to the beer. The service here was great as well. Our server, Eric, is the reason I gave this place two stars instead of one.

20740,2,1546300800000,"There is a special place in hell for those eateries that disrespect a burger. Bill's Bar & Burger has earned a seat in that place. 

My colleague and I were visiting Pitt on business and staying near the Westin where this establishment is located. We walked in during lunch time and it was nearly empty in the restaurant. They were slow to seat us and even slower to take our order. When a server did come by, he apologized profusely for the delay and proceeded to tell us what was good on the menu. He took off to get our drink orders and the smarmy manager swept in to take our food orders and to drone on about his philosophy on the perfect burger. I was sold on substituting the ""english muffins"" for the standard bun and substituting the fries with the homemade chips. I received his high praise for ordering my burger cooked as rare as possible. ""I wouldn't have any other way, sir"" he muttered.

After more than 45 minutes (and don't forget that this place is empty) we were served our ""food"" along with more profuse apologizing for the delay. 

At first glance, the portion size looked really small. I took my first bite and to my dismay (horror) found The patty char-burned and  the two store-bought english muffins not toasted. Really?! I took another bite hoping for the a different outcome. The second bite was worse. And those homemade potato chips were no better -- I think they may have been guitar pics in a former life.

Naturally, I complained to the server and again received more profuse apologizing. He offered to go to the chef and have what remained of the english muffins toasted. I refused (mainly in fear of what they'd do to what was left of my meal) and I told him that I would just pass on the meal altogether. He apologized again said he'd make the smarmy manager aware of the situation. I expected the manager to come right out to apologize and remove the item from our bill. He didn't. In fact, I didn't see the manager again -- as if he vanished. I envisioned him hiding in the kitchen, behind the friolater until we left.

We received the bill and, yes, I was still being charged for that abomination of a meal. All I could do was laugh and leave the scene of the crime with a bit of grace.

They definitely need to work on their service - it's slow and having all the staff linger around the bar, chit chat and eat there seemed a little weird/unprofessional? But whatever, place seems cool - I'd come back here with friends! The ambiance is beautiful and I was already envisioning spending many warm afternoons and evening on their patio enjoying a margarita or two. I came back a week later with some friends and this time we walked out just after a round of drinks and apps because the food was unimpressive and some aspects of the service were pretty bad too. My first time there we tried all the tacos and while the two chicken ones (fried & grilled) were really good, the others were mediocre. My second visit there we had the chips and guac, wings and calamari. The calamari was good, the guac was ok, but the wings were very gamey. What really drove us out though were the drinks. Aside from taking forever to get to us, they weren't even good. We also had a live bartending lesson going on behind our table at the bar, because of which they turned off the music. Really? 
we had to request it be turned back on (which they did eventually) because the place was really quiet and we could hear the step by step instructions on how our drinks were being prepared.

40056,2,1547769600000,"So.......we wanted to go out to lunch, but we didn't want to spend a lot of money.  Remembered that we had received some gift cards from the in laws for the Cheesecake Factory.  Problem solved!  I had not yet been to this Cheesecake Factory since moving out to AZ.  We would go to the one in Mission Valley occasionally and the food/service was usually pretty good.  We came down here to this one today for a late lunch.

We arrived at around 3:00 and there weren't too many people there.  We got a seat immediately at a table and the waitress brought over the high chair.  We placed our order for drinks (waters, and my wife got an iced tea), got some bread delivered (sourdough and a honey oat type brown bread) and placed our order.  I had been scoping out the Yelp reviews and pictures online prior to arrival, and I saw a few pictures of fish tacos.  I had yet to have fish tacos since I moved to AZ, and they looked legit, and sounded legit, so I went with those.  My wife got a lunch sized portion of the pasta carbonara with chicken.  About 15 minutes later, our food was arrived.  Here is how it was..................

Fish Tacos-  These things looked great!  They hook you up with 4 nice sized tacos!  They came with double wrapped corn tortillas, a nice piece of tempura fried white fish which was both crunchy outside and moist inside,  some pickled onions and a little dollop of guacamole.  They usually come with a chipotle sauce, but I skipped that.  The tacos were mighty fine as they were.  Everything worked well!  They were legit fish tacos.  Maybe not as good as TJ Oyster Bar in SD, but they were damn good and better than a lot of fish tacos I have had.  I really liked the pickled onions!  They gave a nice little sweetness to the taco and they were buried under the actual fish.  These tacos were well constructed and just the right size to fill me up but not overstuff me.  The tacos also came with some black beans, and a side of ""green tint"" rice.  I sampled the beans, they were alright.  The rice had a unique seasoning to it.  Almost tasted a bit like pesto sauce, but then I caught a taste of something else.  Definitely unique, but I didn't finish all of it, mostly because I'm not the hugest fan of rice and/or beans.

Pasta Carbonara-  My wife thought it was a bit too ""oily"" so she couldn't finish it all.  I took her bowl of pasta from her and proceeded to have some.  I thought it was fine!  It had a nice sauce, lots of bacon, a little bit of chicken and a ton of peas in it.  I am anti pea, so I ate around all of those.  The noodles, bacon, sauce and chicken were very good.  I couldn't see myself eating a whole bowl of this (reason my wife couldn't finish it either) because it was pretty heavy, but a half portion or if you split this with someone, it was pretty tasty.

Service was fine.  Not great, not poor.  A-OK!  Total for everything was $0.00 thanks to the gift cards!  We skipped dessert and were on our way.  I would definitely come back and probably order the same thing.  Those fish tacos were no joke!  They were delicious as could be!",2

38180,2,1546646400000,"While Total Wine's selection is absolutely unquestionably phenomenal, from wine to beer to liquor, I find it difficult to locate specific bottles of wine. For all you wine snobs out there who spent a semester abroad in France and are turning your noses up at me, I'll remind you that most of us who like wine aren't connoisseurs, and our average wine intelligence is what should be catered to. Now that I got that off my chest, let me comment on the service. At best, it is inconsistent. I'm in there a lot (A LOT!), and it's normal for me to walk in past three managers doing whoknowswhat without eye contact or a greeting. Then I walk alllll the way to the very back of the store to grab that choice little 6-pack I've been thinking about, passing two more employees, and not a word! Am I intruding?!? Should I come back at a better time? Perhaps when the economy isn't doing well and they really need my hard-earned discretionary income? Wait...they do need it. Anyway, then I am ambushed with a surprise hello as I turn the corner and end up dropping whatever was in my hands. I will say their prices overall are hard to beat and that is certainly why I tolerate their service. I have noticed a lot of price increases on things I buy regularly, like the Blue Moon 22oz bottle, which went from $1.89 when the store opened to $3.78! I simply don't buy it anymore. I know businesses are doing what they can to stay alive, but man, that's brutal. If I could do half-star ratings I'd give Total Wine a 3.5, but until their service improves across the board, they're just another warehouse liquor store with a great selection.",3

For a Tuesday, it was hella crowded with old peeps.  I thought I'd left Sun City behind but apparently the ones that have alternate forms of transportation (e.g., a real car vs the golf cart) all descended on Mimi's the day I went.  I agree with Kimberly S on decor--super tacky.  It was like a french cafe and american diner mated & the offspring resulted in a Dennys frame with a French Quarter and generic diner inspired outfit.  

They brought out a small basket of assorted sweet breads before our meal--pumpkin bread, sourdough roll & something resembling a dark but sweet bread with raisins.  I ordered the split pea soup with ham bits--standard fare that was thick but tasty.  

We decided to share dessert & ordered the classic ensemble.  Included in this sampler were an apple crisp served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a bread pudding doused with too much melted butter, and a brownie with with another scoop of ice cream & chocolate syrup.  Definitely more sugar than one should consume in a month, even if you don't consume the small portions in their entirety.

Entrees were the seafood sampler for my husband and me, ahi tuna and swordfish for our friends.  The sampler was good with the seabass being the best bite of the plate.  My friends said their entrees were as good as they looked.  We had the apple crisp special and the chocolate flourless torte for shared desserts.  The apple crisp didn't have much crisp on it and the dish was overwhelmed by a huge scoop of ice cream.",2

35841,2,1548201600000,"I meant to update this review a few days ago; I've been busy. I'm not quite certain if anyone even keeps up with these reviews at all. I do know that I do check all reviews before I select a business to go to.

I spoke to the gym manager. He is always courteous and attentive. He's receptive to feedback. Since then, the peace has been restored at the gym. I've not witnessed any  violent or dangerous situations as had been the recent past trend at nights. 

Things have changed in a matter of weeks. I'm not sure if it was coincidental or if it was due to a performance improvement plan implemented by the manager. Whatever it was, it seems to work just fine. As you come in, the towels are handed to you by the front clerk. In my opinion this is an excellent practice. Not only does it personalize service, making you feel that this is indeed a Super Sport location, but it also prevents the other users from grabbing 5 towels at a time (I never understand why anyone would need 5 towels unless you are about to clean the gym lol!)

On 8/15 (Friday night) I went in for a late workout as I always do. I witnessed the cleaning person do a thorough cleaning session of all treadmills and other cardio equipment. Moving equipment around and making sure everything was spotless clean. I was very pleased to see that. The next morning I went back for a cardio session, and as I walked in Massage Envy was giving complimentary massages ( which of course I enjoyed very much and plan to get a membership with them as well). Later, a beautiful fit woman was promoting a fitness plan at the front lobby. Call me superficial, but I love seeing fit beautiful people at the gym, that is what is all about. I want to workout where people look good and work hard for their good looks. This is what I expect out of a gym.

Finally, what sealed the deal, was a delicious scented tropical smell that welcomes you to the gym as you walk in. Spa like smell...I'm into this kind of stuff... A complete 360 degree turn. This is once again my favorite gym. I'm a sucker for good customer service and beautiful people. When it comes to gyms, I don't want to save money, I want to feel good when I work out. I will pay the additional cost if it delivers. So if you are in town, come check them out. Good place to workout at.",2

We walk in and there is one employee - she is making drinks for the bar, trying to seat us, AND she is also our server.  There weren't many people there so ok - I get it, labor cost savings - However, you jeopardize service - and yes, the service was lacking a little.

We ordered the shredded beef tacos and the grilled burrito with spicy queso.  We got our food (which I felt like it was half an hour later), and I took one bite in the burrito.  It was not good at all.  The spicy queso on top of the burrito tasted like the cheese in a jar that you get at your local grocery store.  It had this taste that I could not get out of my mouth.  Next, the street tacos.  They were a little better, but nothing fantastico!  Bill came up to a little less than $30. I left there and I could not shake that burrito taste out of mouth so I did what I needed to do - I ate a big GOOD brownie all by myself.

Very large serving -- took most of it home to enjoy today.  (I think I'll eat it while she's gone.)  It had the right mix of spices and the chicken was grilled to perfection.  We also tried the chips and salsa.  Jordon said the salsa is spicy hot but could be toned down.  Since we both like hot, we said no to that suggestion.  He wasn't kidding!  It is hot!

1) Do I like sushi? I guess she hasn't noticed that 75% of my reviews are of sushi restaurants. 
2) If I had known we were going to go for sushi I wouldn't have eaten so many cupcakes at the burstday bash! 

Fortunately, I can always make room for sushi.  Cara called ahead to make sure this new sushi restaurant was able to serve us at this late dining hour (almost 11pm). They obliged and there were 5 seats at the sushi bar waiting for us when we got there.

The staff here is super friendly and ridiculously fast.  We placed our orders and were eating within minutes.  We started with a scallop appetizer that was served on a pringle chip. Um, yum.  And I also ordered some hot sake to warm me up on this ridiculously cold night.  Speaking of warming me up the truffle lobster miso soup also did the trick and may have well been the yummiest miso soup I've ever had. Truffle oil and lobster makes everything better!

For my sushi fix I went with a soft shell crab roll and a piece of tobiko.  It totally hit the spot and I managed to finish it all even though I was pretty full from all those cupcakes. 

I'm typically looking for a good sushi spot when I visit new cities and I think I've found one in Cleveland!

I decided to check them out after seeing their Groupon promotion.  It is located in a not too busy strip mall in the part of town I have never visited until coming here.  But it is not that far from the Wynn, just straight down East Desert Inn Road.

Their menu is simple, but still offers a fair selection, plus their specials board has more tempting offers.  You can drop in and order food al la carte to eat on premise or as takeout, they also provide catering services for larger orders.

On my 2 visits, I was pretty much the only customer there, so you will likely never have to wait for an open table if you decide to dine in.  Plus the service was friendly, the entire place (including the restroom) is kept tidy and clean.  And the food order came out reasonably fast.  The food is relatively healthy too, it is not the highest quality Japanese food available in Las Vegas, but for the price and the part of town, it is more than adequate.

Thus far I have tried their Katsu Curry Special (the curry is just the plain curry sauce without any potatoes, carrots, etc.) which has a decent portion and also their Okame Udon (with tofu skin, shrimp tempura, Japanese fish cake and seaweed toppings) and a side of Tuna Roll. Everything was acceptably yummy and fits my diet's macros.  As far as desserts, I don't recall seeing it on their wall menu, which is good, since I didn't need the extra temptation of oh so sweet but alas empty calories.

Bonus for Food Network fans, the TV is always on that channel. So you can eat and watch whatever happens to be on at the moment and maybe get some inspiration of what to eat next.",2

However, spotty service while dining in is nothing compared to the chaos of trying to order take-out or (even worse) delivery. The last delivery order I put in for myself and co-workers wasn't delivered for nearly two hours... when I called to follow up, the restaurant told me that they had our order ready for over an hour, but their courier service was running late... the problem with that is that hot food and FROZEN drinks were put in bags next to each other, so you can figure the rest out... When the courier dropped it off at the office, he said: ""the restaurant said to tell you it isn't their fault, whatever that means, but I'm just the messenger, so it's not my fault either."" It was pretty unprofessional behavior from both TFIC and the delivery service, but ultimately, it was a big FAIL on the restaurant's part. 

All in all, it doesn't really keep me from going there two or three times a week for lunch and dinner. I just keep my expectations low when it comes to ordering without incident, but I know that the food is going to be outstanding 100% of the time.",2
34237,3,1547769600000,"I was able to arrange an appointment to get an estimate almost immediately after I called.  I was quoted what seemed to be a very fair price, with a clear explanation of what would happen on moving day, and how the charges might go up.

On the day of the move, Theo, George and Tyrone arrived right on time.  They were thorough, efficient, friendly, and cheerful.  They also managed complicated angles of my narrow staircase without a single ding to the furniture or the walls.  And we had some really heavy stuff -- exercise machine, dressers, file cabinets.  They arrived at our new house, and again, navigated the stairways -- this time to three floors.  And they maintained their good cheer all day long.

And at the end of the day, the price was exactly the one that was quoted to me on the first day.

I would hire them again in a heartbeat!  Great, great job!",2
43704,2,1548288000000,I love this place. People working here are nice! They have all kinds of events for Magic Players.

31035,2,1547251200000,"this is my favorite restaurant in the united states, and it is on par with my favorite trois étoiles restaurants in tokyo and paris.  after dining here, i'm baffled why the french laundry gets so much attention.

it is undoubtedly extremely expensive, and might be somewhat overpriced.  but the dishes made sense, they worked, they displayed an incredible range of flavors and textures, all delicious.  perhaps most surprising, it was the kitchen's skill that really stood out, rather than a generous use of expensive high quality ingredients.  they were able to make really delicious dishes out of basic things (e.g. soybean sprouts, green beans, apple, blood orange, pistachio, chocolate)  and they used the full range of a garden's vegetables throughout the meal.

it has a reputation of being gaudy, but i actually found it to be a well balanced meal, and the many kinds of breads and petit-fours really added something special.

service was perfect.  room is gorgeous.",2
47906,2,1547856000000,"It was hard for me to go into a building with Trump's name anywhere in the building but I wanted to grab a drink before dinner and wanted a place with a view. Boy, does America have a view. The decor is the perfect blend of luxurious and tacky. Everything in there is quite nice but also looks a little aged, like a restaurant that opened with big intentions but maybe isn't doing as well as they hoped.

Their cocktail list was great with a good combination of high quality traditional cocktails and some more modern ones as well. And they gave us free popcorn too! Yay, bar snacks!

The other guests in there were... hilarious. To put it shortly, if you have not read the infamous review of America from The Globe and Mail entitled ""America at the Trump hotel: The food is amazing - but you shouldn't eat here, ever"", you should. It is quite accurate in it's description of the vibe.

I will likely come back here for dinner. The restaurant is now run by Oliver & Bonacini and I usually like their work so it's worth a try, even if you have to see the word ""Trump""",3

48624,1,1547510400000,"My wife and I tried Luigi's tonight and were mostly unimpressed. Although there were several tables open, we waited better than five minutes before we could interest anyone in seating us.   Then we sat.... and sat..... and sat.... And were about to walk out when a server finally came by and asked if we were ready to order.  We asked if he might want to take our drink order first which seemed to irritate him.  He took our drink order and returned a few minutes later w/o the drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  I asked about the drinks and Justin, our illustrious server, said he was ""in the area"" and thought he could ""save some time"".  That pretty much summed up our service--whatever was most convenient for him. 
  I had the lasagna which was just ok and lukewarm at best.  However, they earned a second star for my wife's pizza--that was darn good.  When it came time to pay the bill, an observant server (NOT Justin) swung over and said that he had seen us looking around as if we needed some help and took our credit card
  Bottom line:  Although the pizza is very good, it isn't worth enduring the lousy service--there are much better choices around town.  We won't be back",2

The food was rather good, and probably comparable in price to most coffee/dessert shops. I tried the strawberry waffle (a belgian waffle with strawberry jam, strawberry ice cream, whipped cream, and sliced strawberries), which was excellent, as well as a mango-strawberry smoothie (they'll mix the flavours they offer, upon request), and a coffee.

My only complaint would be about the coffee... it wasn't excellent (and it was served a bit on the warm side, rather than hot), though it also wasn't bad, and was perfectly drinkable.

31590,2,1547251200000,"Oy vey... over-priced chain restaurant food is never a good thing. 

The beau and I were browsing around Crocker Park for a birthday gift this particular Saturday afternoon, and we were fending off our hearty desires to grab a delicious burger from the newly opened B Spot. See, we're *attempting* to eat healthy and didn't want to put ourselves in a calorie-rific situation of utter defeat.

And let's just be real here--we were looking for a little afternoon cocktail. 

So, quite defeated, we walked right past B Spot (wah!) and gave Champps a shot, hoping for some healthy options. The service was fine enough. Super nice waitresses and staff, you know, pretty standard for chains. We both ordered tuna sandwiches with side salads instead of fries, hoping for the best. What came out was what I believe is known as a level-10 fail. 

Holy effing mayonnaise. We're talking a 60/40 mayo to tuna ratio... gag me. It's not that it tasted horrible, but the look and consistency of this ""tuna salad"" was beyond nasty. It came out on four, open-faced-style triangles of whole wheat that were soggy with the wet, mayo/tuna mixture. To make matters worse, there were half melted pieces of swiss cheese on top of each. I ended up peeling off the cheese to cut the fat-grams, but I doubt it helped. The little salad had the signature ""I came from a big bag"" carrot and purple cabbage slivers. 

The drinks we ordered were super sweet and tasted little of liquor. I'm not one to bitch about cocktails not being strong enough, but this was borderline hilarious. And at about $10 a pop, you'd think it would have a little more booze. 

Anyways, we both left feeling pretty disappointed by this lunch and the bill came to a ridiculous $50+ total. For sub-par chain food and weak-sauce drinks? Booooo. I feel even dumber because I definitely know better than to pick a place like this.... Next time I'll just save my calories for a big, juicy burger from B Spot.",2

29872,3,1548547200000,"I've been here a couple times and it was decent besides the cesspool that are the bathrooms. How they passed health inspections is beyond me. My most recent time turned me off for a couple reasons: lack of a coat check and incredibly poor service at the bar. 
Having to carry around my winter jacket at the bar made my stay there very short. I already had a jacket stolen from me this winter, so I don't let it out of my sight. For a bar with adequate space upstairs to turn something into a coat check -- just shows laziness on the part of the owners.

In terms of the bar. As a bartender who has been in the industry for over 7 years, if I have to wait over 5 minutes for a drink, I leave the bar I'm at. At baby Huey's, the wood is not that big, and the bartenders working on the Saturday night I was there were either drunk, high, possibly both, because they clearly didn't give a shit about pushing drinks out. They took their time, socialized amongst themselves, all traits that make a bar look poorly run. I left and definitely won't be going back. There are so many other bars on this strip that provide friendlier, more efficient bar service. At the end of the day, being slow and unattentive behind the bar equals lower sales overall and less tips. I still don't understand bar owners who keep staff like that around since it hurts them in the end.",2

Earnhardt Hyundai North Scottsdale towed it in and provided a loaner car.

I ordered the Southern Fish with fries and Joel ordered the Chicken and Waffles. We both shared some chili cheese fries as well. The prices are great. For both of us, with drinks, it came out to under $20. My Dad ordered the same as me and spent under $6. You get several pieces of fish and the cornmeal breading is so full of flavor. I thought mine was great, but Joel's chicken... Wow! I wanted to rip it away from him. I wanted to order more chicken just for myself, but I was so full from the fish! His waffle was cooked crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Now let's talk about those chili cheese fries. They came in a large to go container smothered in chili and cheese! What more could you ask for! YUMMY!

The only down side is that there is no bathroom, but they do have a sink so you can wash all the tasty goodness off in. Also, be prepared to wait 'cause they cook everything to order. Which is totally fine in my book!

In the middle of Vegas heat on our first Summer Vegas trip, my car's A/C stopped working. I've heard of Vegas heat, but just couldn't deal with the heat that goes beyond 110 degrees without A/C and searched for the next auto center I could spot (BIG mistake). I came across this auto center that we passed several times on Spring Mountain. The owner came out and asked me in Korean what was wrong and I told him my A/C stopped working. He was very friendly at first and told us to wait inside. I stepped inside to find many out-of-date ads and decors that made me wonder if I was in the 80s Korea. I took out my phone and started yelping the place just to make sure it was decent (how bad could it be?). All I could see in the reviews were ""scammer,"" ""don't go here,"" etc. I look over to my girlfriend with a panic in my expression: ""what have we got ourselves into?"" 

An hour passes by and the owner comes back in the waiting room and says it's done. Wait. What? I'm used to auto centers telling me what is wrong with the car first and giving me an estimate before they perform anything on my car. He comes in and punches numbers and says it's $140--""a good deal"" in his words. I become very skeptical of the ""receipt"" he gave me that just says ""services"" next to the prices and ask him for what exactly was done. He just mumbles that it's all explained on the bottom of the receipt and almost snatches my debit card and makes the payment. At this point, I'm just furious since there was random sentence that didn't describe what they did repeated three times on the bottom of the page. 

Anyways, we go to the car and start the car. 5 seconds pass by, 30 seconds pass by, 1 minute passes by, 2 minutes pass by without cold air coming from the A/C. I go back inside to tell the owner that the A/C is still not working. He calls his mechanic and he works on it for another hour (that includes them running to the Auto Zone next door and getting a thermometer that they didn't have). I just wanted to get out of this scam hole, so as soon as they were ""done fixing"" my car, I drove off. The A/C worked fine until the next day when I had to drive it to another auto shop with a more reputable yelp reviews and they told me the Freon levels were too high and could cause damage in the long run.

Ladies, ladies ladies. One of life's golden rules: Never judge a book by its cover. You only WORK at Christian Louboutin, dears.

On a recent trip to Vegas, I thought I'd treat myself to a couple pairs of shoes. I was specifically looking for a pair of Gloriana flats and a pair of Fifi Botta boots. 

Unfortunately, I didn't find either, but not for want of trying. What I did find were two saleswomen who had just packaged up a bride's shoes and watched her walk out the door and were busily gossiping about her, loudly. 

I had my security detail with me (as I do when I travel). He is a casually dressed, largely built black male. He typically stands a few feet behind me, but his presence is hard to miss in a small shop. While I picked up a dusty Bianca, the saleswomen continued to gossip and glare at my security.

Even some of the best Mexican restaurants don't do that!  It was a real treat!!!  The chili was also fantastic and so was my daughter's mac & cheese.  Staff is super friendly and made me wine spritzers exactly the way I wanted them, with the wine chosen from the wine list.  A big pet peeve of mine is stale lemons or limes in my drink.

Tous les repas viennent avec un potage maison. Pour ma part j'ai pris le menu dégustation (5 services comprenant une entrée au choix, le potage, un trou normand, le repas et le dessert) pour 49$. Ca en valait largement la peine !! L'entrée de tartare de bœuf était délicieuse, et relevée à souhait. Le potage tomate et poivron était aussi très goûteux et velouté.

21472,3,1547424000000,"Whenever I have a department lunch at work I always suggest this place. So much in fact, that people have stopped asking me where I want to go because they know I'm just going to say Aroma.

My love of Aroma began with the simple reason that my breakfast usually consists of a few cups of coffee. By the time lunch rolls around, I have little patience for sitting in a restaurant waiting for food when I'd rather be eating ANYTHING to soothe the burning caused by two (delicious) starbucks grande christmas blends (especially when food is brought out at different times and you need to sit there and stare at it until everyone is served.)

However, like many relationships of convenience my feelings towards Aroma have blossomed and now I am indeed, a fan.

For starters, Aroma has a great selection of dishes, including meat dishes (unlike certain other all you can eat Indian restaurants down the street). The food is not spicy (this is a plus in my situation, so everyone including those who don't care for the spice can enjoy) but it definitely isn't bland. I'm also a big fan of their naan, which is super greasy (never had naan like that before) but insanely good for getting at that last bit of rogan josh on your plate.

The service is fantastic too. My water glass is never empty (important when consuming mass amounts of meat) and they are great at taking plates away when you are finished.

Be warned though - eating at Aroma is a serious threat to productivity, especially on a Friday afternoon.",2

Check out my experience on video https://youtu.be/uPq0WVFhx-o

The sesame bagel was 85 cents at St. Viateur..95 cents here at Fairmont. Also, there is less amount of sesame seeds here at Fairmont. The bagel was softer and sweeter and less crisp (probably because the lack of sesame seeds) still pretty good but personally I liked St-viateur's version more.

We also bought the blueberry bagel..it was cold and hard but when we bit in, it was soft in the inside, tasted like the blueberries were blended in, husband thought it tasted more like muffins lol... too densed and harder to swallow..not my cup of tea.

Been meaning to try this place for special occasions long time ago, but it's always fully booked for holidays. 

They update their menu very frequently, so you may not be able to get what you read from reviews.

Crudo Prawn: We started with an off-the-menu Crudo (Prawn) with crispy prawn heads for $30, good flavor but a little overpriced compared to the portion (only 3 prawns).

Parmigiana which was good too, not a guy into any veggies but hands down the most delicious veggie I ever had. Highly recommend! 

Both pastas we ordered were awesome. Don't get intimidated by the ingredients list. You won't see any offals for sure!

It was a birthday dinner and everyone delivered it so well. We were greeted since entering the door. The manager had some special birthday treat for me too. Thank you!

The portion (both prosecco and Crudo) is a bit small compared to the price.

Where else can you go and not spend a fortune on your hotel room and still be close to all the shenanigans of Vegas.  This was my second stay at the Flamingo.  I was there for a big convention and was rarely in my room.  

With Flamingo, you definitely get what you pay for in the hotel room.  It was a decent room with a great view. I landed the 12th Floor.  However, it's an old building.  Walls are thin so you here everyone and their biz.   Hot water was hard to come by and my toilet started leaking by my fourth day.   

It is a safe Hotel with easy accessibility to all areas of the strip.  The casino, dinning and shopping areas of Flamingo are nice and well managed and the staff are very nice as well.

Stayed here for three nights.  Was looking forward to R&R, but got techno by the pool for two days straight.  The hotel is more interested in pleasing outsiders to come spend money at the pool and bar than making sure guests are happy and comfortable. As a guest you must pay to have an umbrella for shade because they are reserved for people using day beds & getting bottle service.  Because the place was packed and I cant sit in the sun for long we got the day bed, and the total to use it from 1pm to 6pm was 450, tip and tax.  Total rip off.  

On Sunday we opted for laying out on concrete in the shade even though the majority of the day beds were not being used.  We ordered food and drinks and ate on the ground.  About an hour later the pool manger offered us one of the pool beds and shade for the rest of the afternoon free of charge.   

Besides this our stay was great.  I liked the modern decor, it is in a good location, Sushi Roku was delicious, service nice, and there is a decent gym.

To me the W came across as an overly greedy corporation doing it all wrong.  Rooms don't get booked because family's, elderly and many others wont stay here.  They actually lie about how booked it is and turn lights on rooms to make it look full at night [some insider info].  Also don't book over their phone, they will quote you higher rates.  Go though an online travel company for best rates. They really should have enough umbrellas available for all guests.

The difference is real.  The prices here are lower than Saigon Bay but the portions are smaller and the flavor isn't to my liking.  Both have competent waitstaff and plenty of parking.

- Poke: Also an unexpected YES. It comes with fun rice crackers to eat. The poke was good, with interesting bits mixed in. 
- Thrice cooked wings: I think these were good, but I honestly don't remember them.
- DIY Guacamole: We got the variety that had crab and mango mixed in. I thought it was too weird to keep eating; my coworkers liked it, but it was the last item we finished between the three of us. 
- Chorizo tacos: This was really great. The fried egg made it messy to eat, but overall, it was a solid, full taco.

- Pig ear tacos: I think this was a special. I passed on this, but my coworkers loved it, and said it was the best pig ear dish they'd had. 
We got another taco, but unfortunately I don't remember it!

We liked the Grapefruit & Sage margarita, and the frozen rum & banana float cocktail (which was a daily special).

22993,1,1547164800000,"My buddies and I decided to hit up the west side last night and visited Margaritaville.  It was one of the most fun nights out that I have had in quite some time.

We got there and lucked out and were able to get a table in the bar area that was in a prime location with views of everything going on.  From there on, the night just kept getting better and better.

I'll start with the food.  Everything that we ordered (peel n' eat shrimp, tortilla soup, jambalaya, fish tacos, and the ""cheeseburger in paradise"") were excellent.  Our server was one of the friendliest, coolest girls that we have ever met, and made sure that there was never an empty bottle of beer on our table.

As for the atmosphere, this was a tale of two worlds.  As the night began for us (right around 8:00), it seemed like the complete opposite of a night out in the Scottsdale area.  There were actually more girls in the place out and about and having fun than there were guys.  Plenty of cute girls (not a single one fitting the ""Scottsdale"" mold) from all walks of life outnumbered the guys by a 3:1 ratio.  I'm so used to heading out to places where it is just a sausage-fest with all the guys there that I almost didn't know what to do with myself.  And the dudes that were there were normal as well, very casually dressed and just there having a good time with the group of people they came with.  Plus people weren't there trying to pick up on folks and act all cool, but rather there just to enjoy a night out.  Then, almost as the clock struck midnight, things changed.  Suddenly it seemed that the place filled up with the ""Scottsdale crowd,"" meaning girls all done up and dudes that looked (and acted) like complete douche bags.  It turned into a sausage fest full of people normally found on the other side of town.  After viewing ridiculous and immature behavior by the new crowd, we settled up and left.

The band that performed there this night was AMAZING.  They started at 10:00pm and played covers of popular songs from many genres of music.  There was a small area down by the stage for dancing, and as the night went on more and more people were out there dancing and having a good time.

I definitely plan to make this a regular occurrence on Friday nights.  The drive out from where I live in Tempe was well worth it.  I'll just make sure to leave before midnight next time.",2

44470,1,1547424000000,"Delicious! I tried this for the first time after hearing a lot of rave about it during the 5 year week special. Having high expectations, it definitely did not disappoint. For one whole week, they had a 5$ box special which was my go-to.

The monday I had the Mini Everything box. Mini Everything came with Takoyaki, Croquette and Chicken (one of everything). This is regularly $12. The Takoyaki was very delicious and came with more squid than other Takoyaki's that I've had. The Chicken (Karaage) was very good and the breading with the sauce really put it together for me. All of the boxes come with purple rice, shredded pickled ginger, and the sauce! I hope the portions are much larger for the regular price as I would not pay that much for the same portion that I got. 

The Tuesday I had the Nan Ban Chicken box. This comes with 3 pieces of chicken and their Nan Ban sauce which was a lime-y mayo like sauce. Very good but can be too saucy for most people. 

Personally, I would definitely just get the original chicken box as it's the most worth and you can definitely taste the flavour a lot more. Just watch out for lunch hour, the line could get pretty long.",2

I don't remember exactly what I got, but it was a vegan dish with peas as a star.  What I do remember is how very bland it tasted.  I'm no expert, but I'm also no stranger to Indian food.  The spicy tomato-y sauce that is a base/part of many dishes was water-y and lacked flavor.  I even ordered it ""medium""!

What is bad was the speed of delivering the food. We did an initial order of around a dozen types of skewers double orders. Each skewer took 5 to 15 minute to arrive. The food came at such a glacier pace the meal felt like small bites of snacks than anything but we were scared to order more. The entire meal took a little over two hours and the bill was only a hundred - just to show how little food we had ordered and how long the meal took. With the onigiri and shrimp skewer coming last at the 100th minute! Which isn't even a dish but some how shrimp skewer and rice ball with kelp inside warrants an almost 2 hours to preparation time. All 4 of us were still hungry we had to go to future bistro after for another plate of nachos, beer and cheesecake before calling it a night.

Well if you sign up for a players card, weekday buffet lunches are only $6.99pp. Then bring in a 2 for 1 coupon in the weekly Sunday magazine, and you got yourself a $3.50pp lunch.  We all know this is not top of line food here, but can you even get a combo at Mickey D's for less than $5 bucks nowadays? Nope. And the cheese is never melted on their burgers!

There were quite a few more than edible items. Ham in the carving station, cowboy stew, machaca, baked chicken, deep fried scallops on skewers (gf went back for thirds on those), plus a decent sized salad bar, fresh fruit (cantelope and honeydew, pineapple, and various canned fruits in syrup).  The small Mexican section even had nopales salad.  One dish to skip is the pork chops though. Dry!

Doesn't ever seem to be a line here. So if you're in the area (great location on Flamingo near Tuscany and Platinum) stop by for a cheap lunch.

I have a bohemian taste in style to begin with, but Stephanie keeps the store stocked with a wide (and tasteful) variety of furniture. I moved into a modern high rise and wanted a clean, modern look with a little feminine flair. I opted on a Parisian text print sofa and chair in cream with high quality cushions and Stephanie bundled them together for an awesome price. 

Stephanie was helping a few other groups of people while also assisting me, which did not deter her from pulling out catalogs to help me find a matching bed frame and head board for the sofa. Although I decided to forgo the bed frame, a rustic metallic mirrored book shelf caught my eye as I was on my way out. Stephanie added the bookshelf to my order without delaying me and arranged for the same delivery company to bring the bookshelf to my new home without extra cost. Her delivery man, Nick, delivered the sofa, chair and very fragile bookshelf in perfect condition, no scratches or marks! 

I highly recommend BOHO Furniture Gallery. Since I was new to town, I looked at furniture prices on Amazon.com before checking out local stores and am pleased to say BOHO's prices are very competitive and their delivery service beats Amazon's prices by far.

Nice, clean eating area

34915,3,1546387200000,"Did you know that Woody Harrelson has received his haircut here? This is a cool spot for an haircut.

This is the oldest standing barber shop in Toronto! Since 1925, the ""Boys Club on Bay Street"" has been a downtown fixture at Bay/Dundas, offering haircuts, massages and hot lather shaves in a classic barber shop setting.

I didn't have time for a wet shave, but I'd try that even despite Paul R.'s bad experience during his visit to the store. For $17.00 who can go wrong? That's what they also charge for an haircut too, by the way. And for the professional cut that you get, that's cheap. The key to a great haircut (for real men) is a good taper. Attention to detail in the taper and how the hair grows from the crown down into the taper will make or break your haircut. These guys know what they're doing. I was fifteen years in the military - I know all about haircuts, and these guys are good.

They only accept cash - another reason I like them. You won't feel badly handing them a twenty and turning down the change - I felt like a million bucks coming out of there. The chairs and furniture are ancient; old and sturdy. The barbers know their craft.

Why don't you just come down yourself sometime and relax in your chair, watch the others get their haircut and when it's your turn, relax and enjoy your time. No need for chit-chat or anything. You'll like this place; trust me!",2
44159,1,1546473600000,"We stayed here in Oct, because our friend happened to own a place here.  The check-in was pretty smooth and met with a smile.  However, that's the only service we've got without pulling some teeth.  One more pro: free parking.  I guess this is a huge amenities in Vegas.

I didn't realize that these units are mixed owner-owned and hotel-owned.  It feels like hotel coming in, but they give you very little service after handing you the key.  The unit was pretty clean so I was very happy when we first got in.  However, the fridge was leaking water inside and were only provided with like few towels that wouldn't last us the entire 5 nights we were staying there.  We were family of 4.  There was no daily housekeeping in light of true Airbnb style.  In fact, we had no utensils initially to use in our kitchenette.  We usually fully use all kitchenette whenever we check into a condo.  So it was confusing when we didn't have utensils and barely any pots/pans.  I asked housekeeping for utensils and didn't get them.  I was really confused why there's a kitchen but no utensils.  I had to dig through our luggage to find plastic ones and had to get them from Starbucks.  I think we finally got a set 2 days before we took off.  They also refused to give us extra towels and not even blanket that wasn't stocked in the unit (for some reason, they never had the extra blanket where it should've been).  It's not likely that we would've lied about its existence.  Maybe previous people took it?  I have no idea.  But they had to consult my friend whether they can give us one.  We had the option of renting one for $5/night.  If this was the case, I wish I knew about it so that we could've brought our own!  Kinda ridiculous, though.  My friend relied on the hotel's housekeeping to stock certain items that you'd expect in the unit.  I think even he was disappointed.  They often had to consult the homeowners association to see if certain things were allowed to be given to us, which really increased the time we'd get anything.  We did score a roll of paper towel so thank you.

Anyhow, I'm super grateful for my friend for the unit, but I saw how Airbnb customers would get treated and didn't seem right.  I thought Palms management was hired to provide services for those checking in, but it's quite minimal.  The common areas are wonderful, clean, and beautiful.  But even this one valet was rude to us when I tried to use the cart to bring in some groceries, because we had so many bags that we had to lug from our parking space FAR away.  It wasn't like he was trying to help us with the bags.  He just scolded us for trying to use the cart, because he mentioned that ""This is a premium hotel.""  Seriously?  Most premium hotels would've offered to help me with the bags.  I was with my 4 year old so the help would've been really nice.

I would've given this place 1 star, but I really do like the free parking (even though it's quite a walk from there to front door).",2

44943,3,1547769600000,"I just got a small order of business cards (50) and made sure I called to get a quote. When I asked how much it cost and how long, I was told 1.24 a sheet of 8 to 10 per sheet. As I already had the design I brought it in on a USB stick to get it printed. They did it almost immediately as the lady originally told me it would take her a couple of days because of existing jobs. And that's it, no other explanations and I didn't know what questions to actually ask. My bad.
So I get rung up and it is 15.00! More than double my phone quote. When I questioned the price, the gentleman who did the job scowled and said that's just for paper. It doesn't include print and cut. The lady was brought over and first of all admitted her mistake. I said, why wouldn't I just order 500 online at 19.99. She then started to argue with me doing a comparison between ordering online where cutting is included and bringing it directly into the store. She would wave the extra 5.00 (making it 20.00) for what was already done or I could order another 50 for 19.99. Absolutely nothing made sense. She was clearly flustered by her error.
I did comment that when asked what something would cost, quote it in-store and online to avoid a misunderstanding like this. And don't wait until the job is done not having any realistic options on both ends. I guess I could have walked out of the store and dealt with another, but I took the hit. Her response was ""I'm sorry, but we're really busy in here"".
A costly (although small to some) mistake and lesson learned. I will not deal with this store again.",2
46916,1,1548547200000,"We come here for the grocery, and more importantly, the food! Not the cleanest atmosphere, but they have a great selection of spices and ingredients. The wholesale warehouse a ways down the street is now open to the public and has more of a selection for grocery stuff.

The restaurant is known for the food, not the service. They have a simple menu, hand cooked food, and cheap prices. Falafel is tasty and they have a good selection of necessities; tabbouleh, gyro meat, rice, salads, pitas, and dessert. You can go in and get the food for take out, or take a seat for a quick bite on the other half of the store.

I would highly recommend the chicken shawarma plate. You'll be stuffed if you finish the whole thing, but I always want more, and as soon as I leave I think of the next time I get to go back and get it again. It has a great sampling of the best seasoned tabbouleh I've had at a restaurant, creamy hummus and some amazing garlic sauce. The chicken is moist and you cannot go wrong with putting sumac on everything (the dark red spice in the glass shaker on the table). Finish off with some of the amazing baklava and you'll be all set for the day!

Staff is friendly, and this place is worth going to if you need middle eastern spices and canned goods that you can't get at a normal grocery store.",2
36622,3,1546473600000,"I-can-haz-soft-spot for Cocolini's.  It's not the most exotic gelato shop in Vegas but it's the place where I lick my wounds, stop the bleeding, & control my urge to sob when things go horribly, horribly wrong at the Venetian Blackjack tables.

BLACKJACK @ VENETIAN?
Yeah.  Y'see, there are only 2 lonely double deck Blackjack tables with a .40% house edge on $25/$5000 limits just outside of the food area of the Venetian.  These tables have the lowest edge in the casino outside of high limit, and while they have a horrible 55%-60% cut that sometimes on good nights ""adjusts for the better"" with a solid set of tokes here & there, they're one of my favorite locations to play for a variety of historical reasons.

But things don't always go my way and on realllllly bad nights, when I fall off my stool in disbelief after a dealer repeatedly & shamelessly pulls a 5 on a 6 against my 20, I drag my bullet-ridden body to the food court in a ""quest for sugar"", all the while figuratively pulling those '5' cards out my back like sharp metal-tipped medieval arrows.  

A QUEST FOR SUGAR?
Yeah - gelato.  I mean, until they sell other, more effective stimulants at the food court, we'll all have be satisfied with gelato & sorbets.  So I pull out my left-pocket money and throw down the cash for a quadruple scoop of Lychee & Mango sorbet + Mint Chocolate & Dark Chocolate ice cream. And I sit in the corner next to the lonely, rarely used ATM on the side and whimper quietly while eating gelato until I fall into a sugar-induced coma.

So if you ever see a Japanese guy in a dark sportcoat with short, gelled hair, sitting by himself next to the food court ATM eating a utterly colossal mound of gelato... give him your pity and maybe even offer your condolences.  Bless you, kind reader... [sob]... bless you in advance.

OH, LOOK... SHIIIIINY OBJECT!
I sit next to the ATM for one reason and one reason alone... and that's to play the age-old game, ""Pro or No"".  At 1:00AM, this narrow area in front of the food court is a well-known haven for escorts looking for their next customer.  They sit at the dollar slots along the walkway toward the the elevators smoking Virginia Slims and occasionally playing a dollar or two on the ""Indiana Jones"" machines they're sitting at.  

Spotting the 'creative capitalism' going on between the ladies and their new friends while chomping away at ""a cup of Lychee"" is a funny & distracting sport that challenges my weary noggin' & takes my mind off the fact that I just dropped a f-ckin' chocolate or two at the tables.

AND THAT REALLY MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER?
Oh yeah.  Totally.  It's a time-proven tradition - try it the next time you've lost an assload of money... so much dough that you can't even rationalize commiserating with your pals at the Rhino for fear of not having cab fare the next day.

After getting enough confidence to stand again, I can go back up to my room,  smile, and open the ol' laptop to do something productive.  Like write a review on Yelp about the wonders of Cocolini.

I didn't ""believe"" in chiropractic then.
Finally when I could barely put my foot down on the ground to walk, the pain was so bad, someone persuaded me to try chiropractic.  I went to Dr. O'Hara.  After her assessment she said she knew what was wrong, and gave me some adjustments for 'rib syndrome'.  And leaving the office, I was 90% better.  Like, just a bit shy of 'perfectly fine'.  After *years* of suffering.  I moved away and have seen 3 or 4 chiropractors since, just to maintain my happy skeleton, but I missed Dr. O'Hara.  There was an adjustment she did that nobody else seemed to be able to do, that always made me feel so much better!!

Years later, I was in the neighbourhood with spine locking up very badly.  Dr. O'Hara wasn't available but Dr. Rankin was.  Disappointed, but in desperation, I agreed to treatment.  And. he. was. awesome. with. sauce!!!  So thorough, so gentle, so effective!!  They are amazing in this place.  Every chiropractor should have to intern with these folks!

27110,1,1547337600000,"My fiance used to live in Arizona, so when he would come to visit, we would stay at this hotel (which was about one or two weekends a month). The rooms are nice and pretty spacious no matter whether you get a deluxe suite or a basic room. We always opted for a deluxe suite though, and usually tried to stay in the same room every time because it had special memories to us. Deluxe suites include a nice one person jacuzzi tub, a large shower, a very comfortable bed with tons of pillows, and floor to ceiling windows that are amazing if you have a city view.

***UPDATE***

It only took one incident for me to feel the need to lower my rating from 5 stars to 2.

My fiance moved to Vegas a year ago, and on my birthday he planned for us to stay in the specific hotel room mentioned in my first review, and he was going to propose. He called in advance, got the reservation for the weekend, and was guaranteed the specific room he asked for. Come the weekend of my birthday, my fiance checked in, and the man at the counter informed him that our room that we were guaranteed was given to someone else. Bummed, my fiance reluctantly agreed to accept another room. That is when he was told that, despite it being check-in time, there were no rooms available yet, and that we would have to wait. My fiance came back and told me, and we stood there and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. With our luggage right there, mind you.

An hour passed and we were still not checked in. I finally got fed up and spoke with the manager, a short blonde/light brunette female (didn't remember her name). I was firm but polite about my annoyance with the situation, and she was RUDE beyond belief. She kept talking over me, interrupting me, and telling me that we were never guaranteed the room, when yes, we were. Finally she offered to knock off $10 off our stay, and a room became available immediately.

After this, we decided to stop staying at this hotel. It wasn't worth the hassle anymore.",1
27110,3,1548892800000,"Feels weird to review something other than a restaurant so positively but I felt compelled after my recent experiences with AccountingProse.

As a small business owner [computer janitor], I was not unhappy with the bookkeeper I was already using when I heard about AccountingProse. A friend who runs a few businesses suggested I look at their services and pricing and see if it might be worth switching. This is a person who I trust implicitly about food, drink and music, so why not business services?

Upon my first meeting with Cristina [the boss? I think, not sure. She has the air of a boss if that makes sense :p] I knew instantly I would switch over for one very simple reason:

Passion.

That's right, passion. This lady is just plain nutty about numbers and hell bent on doing the best possible job she can. And it is clear how this impacts her work. I always try and bring this level of service to my customers, and I never felt this level of give-a-shit from previous bookkeepers. It has been extremely refreshing working with her. In the past three months I have:

*Paid less for my bookkeeping services
*Gotten vastly better service
*Reduced overhead [a.k.a. increased profits] with a few cool tricks she brought to my attention [details that never seemed to catch the eye of my former firm]

I have also recommended AccountingProse to just about everybody I know. The person who recommended to me is one of those extremely finicky people whose opinion I knew I could trust. Most of my friends see me the same way.

My job was to secure the hotel and pick which buffets we were to eat at (we purchases the $45 for 24 hours of buffets pass) and my sister's job was to pick one nice spot for dinner. That was how we ended up at Prime Steakhouse in Bellagio.

The food was amazing. This was what we ordered:

- Prime onion soup with gruyere cheese = absolutely divine. What's not to like about anything gruyere.
- Filet Mignon with shishito peppers. I had it medium rare because that's how I like mine to be done = melted in my mouth. Lightly seasoned but was very tasty and so tender.
- Peppercorn New York steak (this was what the bride ordered). Done medium rare. I had a taste and it was so good. Nice and meaty and lots of flavor.
- Caramelized scallops = so good! It has a slight sweet kick but also very savory. The scallops filled you up because they were huge.  
- Some of the sides we ordered were the summer corn, creamed spinach and truffle mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. All were superb! Well-made and delicious!

We made reservations and got there right on the dot. We were immediately greeted and seated right away. Our server and all the workers were very attentive throughout the whole dinner, refilling our water glass, making sure our cocktails tasted right, brushing the bread crumbs off our table, etc. Since it was a bachelorette party dinner, there was also a photographer that was there and took pictures of our party. She had it all printed on glossy paper and framed for us by the end of dinner and asked if we wanted to purchase any. We bought two for the bride as a memorable gift.

The restaurant was very clean and the set-up was done well. I couldn't get over how beautiful the restroom was! I could literally live in there! lol.

Prime Steakhouse did me well! I was very satisfied by the quality of the food and staff.

They were so tiny and unappealing. I did not want to just turn and leave. After all, I was dying for some pastries to remind me of home. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. Definitely turned out to be the worst decision of the day.

The cheesecake had a strange after taste and the peanut butter pie also had a strange after taste. It really just reminded me of freezer burn. The crust was oddly oily, yet dry at the same time. I gave it to my 12 year old son, who will eat anything, and he declined. My husband said, ""my taste buds just jumped to their death."" This is from a man who will eat anything with peanut butter.

Seems like the place got crazy busy during the time I was looking at the chicks and the poultry supplies.   Shop is kinda small and well stocked so a few customers make it look busy quick.
She gave me info about the Gilbert HS program that might prove useful in the near future too.

I had seen Copper City Bourbon around, but had not yet tried it. 
Rodney was at the Yelp Downtown Revival party - I was bummed the bourbon was all gone by the time I got to him, and all he had going was the gin. Not a gin fan at all, he sensed my disappointment and pulled a smaller bottle of whiskey out for me to try.

It.Was.Amazing!!!
And - not available in stores - to get it, I'd have to go to the distillery in Tempe.

I did that (with Robyn N.) on Saturday after a huge and wonderful lunch - and am so happy I did!

The place is a bit confusing to get to - I'd suggest calling first and asking directions. We really weren't sure we were in the right place.

We met up with Jason, Rodney's partner and the master distiller.

The bourbon is good. Really good. But that whiskey - WOW! And - get this! Not only is it distilled here, but the wheat is grown near Casa Grande! Totally AZ business! 

I've been telling everyone at work, all my friends (in person, on phone and Facebook) about this stuff. I've invited people over to my place to taste it. It really is THAT GOOD!

Super nice guys, with a great product! (Oh, and I hear the gin is good, too!)

We decided to eat inside, since I wanted to take some photos for yelp and get a better idea of why this place was so poorly reviewed. 

I found the food (Fish & Chips) to be delicious! Pleasantly Surprised!! They also have a Veggie Burger, but we didn't go for it...The Fish has some spice and herbs in the batter which make the fish flavorful and unique. We both (My husband and I) ordered Fish & Chips and a pint of Stella. It was well cooked... Taite said it was one of the best fish he has had in Toronto... Crunchy Batter, Flaky Fish... Photo's Included...He would give the fish a 4 1/2 out of 5 (He is a hard marker when it comes to fish) 

This bar has very cold beer, a great on tap selection and a typical darker and warmer feeling that most traditional pubs have. (I took a picture of the on tap menu for those looking) 

There was one gentleman running the entire show, taking orders, working the bar, making drinks for tables, and for bar patrons and serving up the tasty food. He was very polite, genuine and accurate. We got our beer in 2:36 seconds after we ordered... Pints... Good Service to say the least! Also, we got our fish in about 12 minutes... Piping hot Fish, okay hot fries... The fries are like a skinny shoe string fry with the peel on. I would have liked them to be hotter, but I am really picky about the heat of my food. (steaming hot, burn your face is right up my alley) 

This place is a solid local pub, It isn't a Hipster joint where Hipsters can pretend to play dingy while getting served up gourmet something you have never heard of... It is a good bar where they are polite, to the point, efficient and don't have time to give the reach around the Hipsters want... But We liked it. There was some major damage on the ceiling near us, but we were told about it, and I didn't find that distracting at all. 

The Hockey Game was playing on a Monster Screen, and on several other TVs... We will be back. They also have Karaoke, which I always like to check out karaoke...

Our Bill 2 Beer, Two Piece Fish & Chips X 2 and a soda all rang up to under $40.00 with Tax. 

I like it.

I usually love kabob places and I saw that this place had 4 stars and I was impressed by the amount of reviews and rating so I decided to give this place a try. So I came here yesterday with my man and we were a little disappointed in this place see he's Persian and he always takes me to good Iranian places and this place has like a twist between Iranian and Mediterranean flavors. We got the chicken kabob plate with the rice and salad and we also got the shirazi salad for the appetizer. So I'll start with the appetizer. Shirazi isn't supposed to be spicy they add jalapeños and not enough salt. Don't get me wrong I love spicy stuff but when it comes to this it's not supposed to have that ingredient in it. And the chicken it was alright a little on the salty side but it wasn't horrible. And for the rice I'm going to be brutally honest here it seemed like low quality basmati rice it just didn't taste too well.

My stepdad hates pretty much every restaurant we go to, and his most frequently said phrase after dinner is ""4/10.""  Black Dog got an ""Eh, I'd come back here,"" which is a ringing endorsement from him.

In addition they have a nice selection of beers on draft at all times.  The first time I went here, my boyfriend got the sampler and it had 4 pale ales, which I was a little disappointed in (though they were pretty good).

25675,1,1547683200000,"I had a consultation with Dr. McGee early this year.  He was referred to me by a local (private high school) football coach, who highly recommended Dr. McGee.  The doctor was very knowledgeable, professional and confident in his skills to repair my badly torn rotator cuff.  I was impressed so I scheduled surgery at that time for the following week.
I informed Dr. McGee that I had an appointment for a second opinion with a very prominent orthopedic surgeon the next day.  Dr. McGee told me that was good but also said that the next Doctor wouldn't want to do the surgery as it was too complicated and would take too long.  After speaking with the 2nd Doctor I couldn't believe his attitude about helping me and said he could not guarantee a good result.  I was told it would be at least a month to schedule surgery, that I would be in a sling for 6-8 weeks and then start physical therapy.  Dr. McGee predicted that would be how my consult would go and he was exactly right.
I had my surgery with Dr. McGee as scheduled and it was the best decision I could have made.  Dr. McGee was honest with me that hard part was just getting started and that recovery was a long road ahead, but if I put in the hard work, I did not have to live in constant pain and limited mobility.  I started physical therapy the day after surgery with D1 Total Sports Medicine & Orthopedics with my physical therapist, Mike Edwards.  They are located in Dr. McGee's office and worked hand in hand with my surgeon to ensure my recovery.
I am very happy with my results.  After 6 months, I was doing things I thought I may never do again.  I have great range of motion, my strength has returned and I can get back to a normal life.  Dr. McGee and his staff were very accommodating.  He once made a special trip to the office to sign my prescription as I was going out of town and really needed it.  Thank you Dr. McGee and all the staff, Brian, Angel, Heather, Perry and anyone else I have forgotten!",2

We ordered a teriyaki chicken dish, the middle pieces were literally raw... We show it the waiter, he agrees, takes the whole dish back. He comes back sometime later with the same dish with the same chicken cooked. The raw chicken was sitting on a bed of cabbage n he re-cooked the chicken and put it on the same used plate. Unbelievable! 

Otherwise none of the dishes were that great...

We ordered a ""Popcorn Lobster""roll... It was almost $20 for this roll... Would be a fair price if we had actually gotten lobster, however, we got some nasty crawfish bites that were fried...

38569,2,1548892800000,"This review is on the front desk staff and our stay. We booked this hotel through Hotwire for a killer deal, there's an 'resort fee' on top of the rate which was the cost of the room but still a better deal than anything else online. 

We checked into the hotel in the afternoon, got to the room and the room was 'used' the bed wasn't made, the soap was opened a towel on the floor in the bathroom. We called down to the front and they upgraded our room and brought us up a key. Problem solved, late checkouts often cause issues so it wasn't a big deal. 

Tip for families, North Tower by North Tower parking garage, the rooms cost an upgrade fee but you don't have to trek through the casino and you're right by your parked car if you park there. The rooms are upgraded and easy in and out. 

The second time I stayed there, I asked for a room North Tower by the N. towert parking garage and they hooked it up. The room was nice, clean and quick in and out. 

The coffee in the room is k-cups and they charge 3.50 for the paper cup and cup of coffee with the creamer and sugar packets inside. Hey it's there in your room and pretty tasty, you can always bring your own k-cups if you are hooked on those things, me personally i prefer a fresh cup of coffee!

I also had the Battered Fish bao, which I preferred over the chicken, however it could've also been more flavourful. My friend had the Pork Belly and she was not impressed with seasoning either.

The wait on a Saturday morning was too long - but I suppose for some people that means that they're popular.  Food took too long, too.  Our server was friendly, but clearly had too many tables to pay us much attention.

Guineafowl, pheasant, duck, venison, merguez, bison, wild boar, elk, rabbit, and kangaroo (you heard it right - Kangaskhan ... I mean kingaroo). There are also gluten-free, vegan, and traditional sausages available. To order, you first select a meat and follow by either picking two toppings on a toasted bun (sweet sauteed onions, sauerkraut, sauteed jalapenos, sweet peppers, or giardiniera - extra CAD $2.25) OR selecting the currywurst style (sliced sausage served with country bread and tomato curry sauce). Once you place your order, just grab your number and the staff will come find your table.

Parking: I don't really want to know how much I have paid for public parking during my stay in Toronto ... I had to pay CAD $15 (Friday and Saturday from 6 PM to 6 AM) at the Indigo parking lot (75 Portland Street M5V 2M9 Toronto Ontario CA) and it is just a block away from the bar.

Kangaroo (fine herbs; sweet pepper and jalapeno on a toasted bun, CAD $9.75): Sausage tasted somewhat plain, but at least I like kangaroo better than veal.

49151,2,1546819200000,"I was referred to Bobby at Valley Vista Pool care by a co-worker. I had just moved and needed pool care service. I was told he was running a special, 3 months of service for $99. Sounded like a great deal right? After a couple of weeks I paid for all 3 months of service at once because it seemed to be going well. He serviced our pool once a week for about a month and a half, installed a vacuum that he recommended and we were trying out. It kept coming out of the skimmer every time the pump went off so when the pump came back on It was not attached. He blamed us for not having it attached. After I explained how the hose floats out of the skimmer when it was off he said he would put a rubber fitting on it. He never added the fitting. Next thing we know he took the vacuum out, and never came back. He will not return calls or text messages and we are still due 1 1/2 months of service. If you want to deal with an untrustworthy pool care company, this is the one for you.

***Adding this to my review since he deleted my comment to his comment:  I went to this ""expert"" for help with a difficult pool. My understanding with the vacuum was that we were trying it out before I paid for it. My pool has in-ground pop-ups, an old sand filter and a 3/4 hp motor on the pump so he told me he wasn't sure how it would all work together, with attaching the vacuum to the skimmer. He installed the vacuum mid-June. I offered to pay electronically twice, he acted like that was a foreign concept, also to pay by check at least twice and he wouldn't go to the door and get it from my son who was holding a check for him, excuse me for not trusting you would get it by leaving it by the pump, it could have blown away. He never told me that the fitting was in the box, just that he would take care of it. If he didn't want to deal with my difficult pool situation he should have just communicated that to me. I guess if your pool is easy to deal with he is your guy.",2

They have a great flatbread selection for dinner. I like the duck confit or the carne asada. The beer cheese pretzels were also a favorite and we saw many people order them.

When we were shopping for windows, several other companies had the same requirements. However, none of these companies had what Anderson had, the amazing product to back it up. The in-home demonstration is a fairly intense event, I could see how they would only want to do that once and have you both available to make your decision at the time. Of course, you do not have to say yes during that first demo. You have the option of declining or accepting at a later date.

I live in Arizona. Our heat eats vinyl windows. The design of the Anderson windows beat out everyone. The quality that Anderson has is second to none. 

We purchased windows for our entire home. It did take a while to receive the windows, because they are produced custom for your home. 

We had them installed today, and I cannot say enough wonderful things about their installation team. We had a four person crew at our home working hard all day. They were professional, friendly, and very hard-working. They knew their craft and it showed. I was so impressed with them I cannot say enough about that.

Yes....
But
For me it's based on common courtesy and customer service
But here's where the downfall comes out....

The moment I walked in I noticed something was off...

1.
The shop has no sort of filteration for its shop to make sure the shop isn't as cloudy
I've walked into shops before but never before we're they as bad as here
 esp since I walked in with a friend who was ashmatic, who can walk into other vape shops with me and not have an issue whatsoever
Here they walked in and within 2 min had to walk back out


2. Experience and knowing what you carry...
The gentleman behind the counter had no experience with the mods I was interested in...he had to ask his buddies who were on the lounge couch about different mods...


If it's a lounge as well for customers to relax....why is there no space on em for their POTENTIAL customers... if it's just filled with your buddies on their phone n such 
 
Having to pick up the phone during a transaction to know how to do a certain procedure is more so falls on bad training

And stating that it's your 3rd day at the shop
Says that there is need of more training needed 


Please train a Lil more or know you hire someone who knows about the mods and equip you carry

3.
Customer service is a plus
When someone walks in.
Says I have XXX amount of dollars what can you help with a set up and focused the words on set up....
Meaning
Mod
Tank
Battery 
Juice etc
And all you say is I have this mod that is like 90% of the ammount requested
And is still needed more equip for the mod to over due the person's financial expense is wrong esp trying to sell something that the customer doesn't want....
Yes up selling is great but try at least with the persons financial ability
Losing a few bucks as well isn't bad as long as you know the customer is happy and will come back and tell friends etc....
1...we all know stores don't buy a product for the same price they sell the product for...
2..we know commission is a great part of life but hey try and think with quality service...not with how much am I gonna make off this deal

Could be as simple saying hey let me get you some sort of full set up with what you have avail financially....and know your customer is vaping the moment they walk out of the store and a happy

And if someone told me that they had a decent ammount of cash to spend I would try and focus on making them happy  not just blow them off for another customer who walks in WITHOUT saying hey I'll be right back....or excuse me I'll be right back

If the gentleman could have tried and pick up the phone to call boss and try and make a deal maybe he wouldn't have had a dissatisfied customer

Be like hey
Go look at our pamplets of juices avail as you relax on the couch as I make a quick call to my boss and see if I can make a deal
That couldn't happen cause the buddies overflowed the couch

Or say hey what kind of juices are you into and try and up sell on that 

But not saying a word makes customers unhappy at times
Thinking the establishment has no experience in the vape community


I kinda felt bad even spending money cause the experience wasn't as great from what I seen in other shops... and since I been told from lots of others who tell me the shop is awesome

29718,1,1547942400000,"Called and was quoted $79 for 5 rooms.  They show up and start the up selling,  they do a spot cleaning to show me how clean they will get the carpet, the $79 price is for a steam clean only with no chemicals.  Nobody ever stated this over the phone.  The price is now $320 for a deep cleaning which is spraying an enzyme on your carpet and spending a little more time steam cleaning, at this point I am not very happy but I need my carpets cleaned, I tried getting Zerorez but that was a joke, so I ended up getting them down to $250 if I paid cash.  Tech was nice and seems to have done a decent job but I used to get this type of cleaning for $150 until the guy I used for years retired. Spraying an enzyme on the carpet to clean it better does not cost an extra $240, it is the old bait and switch, seems to be common based on the other reviews. 

If you decide to use them do not expect to get your carpets cleaned for their advertised price unless you just want a very basic surface cleaning.  I do not plan on using them again.",2

1. The games are free. That is awesome assuming the place isn't too busy. They have a small, but decent, selection of arcade games to choose from including a Mortal Kombat game (FTW!!!). 

2. They have beer....said beer is decently priced. 

3. They have happy hour.... who doesn't like happy hour? 

4. Their staff are generally friendly. 

5. They have trivia night on Thursdays at 7 pm and it is free to play.

6. The Golden Banana..... a beer cocktail that is fabulous (think chocolaty beer mixed with fruity flavors....it sounds weird, but it' really good). 

7. The atmosphere is fun and their mural on the wall is fabulous!


Cons:

1. If they are busy, service is hard to come by. 

2. Most of their cocktails have been just ok.... I haven't come across any cocktails (save my beertail (?) discussed in the Pros) that I would order again off their specialty cocktail menu. 

3. The trivia is a 'Geeks Who Drink' trivia night, which is a bit less fun than the original trivia nights you can find in other bars (not really the bar's fault, but you know).

4. Their food is a bit lack luster. It's supposed to be sort of 'grimy' I guess...their menu has things like grilled cheese and tater tots and choco tacos on it. I tried their gordito and it was fine, but not something I would get again.

One of my favorite things to get is their croissant sandwiches. They always come fresh and hot when served to you. Another sandwich I highly recommend is the Pesto with bacon. In all honesty, all of the sandwiches I have tried have been very tasty. 

Drinks: 5/5
I have tried both their mango and strawberry smoothies and both are amazing. I love how fresh the fruit is and you can tell it isn't artificial flavoring or anything. I also really love their espresso drinks and I highly recommend the White Chocolate Mocha Frappe. It's way better than an overrated Starbucks drink.

I was completely blown away by how gorgeous my CX5 looks.  The carpets which had salt/stains, look absolutely brand new, as do the carpeted mats.  The engine was immaculately cleaned and the paint just sparkles.  My only complaint was that they didn't call to say it was finished after they had it from 11am-4:00pm and when I called, no one answered, so we just drove out and hoped it was ready, which it was.  They lost one star for that.  Also, I have a small crossover SUV, but I was still upcharged for a full size SUV ($25).  It still was a tremendous deal and I have already recommended and probably have two or three friends who will be making an appointment.

22447,3,1548288000000,"I work downtown; been here two or three times for lunch.

Pork BBQ - Their's is good.  Good flavor, several sauces available, and the portions (at least on the Plate) are fine (not heaping, but fine). 

I've had the Brunswick Stew.  Okay, so simply based upon my experience and input from friends, Brunswick stew is usually thick and not soupy.  The stew is soupy here - i.e. it has a lot of broth.  But, get this now... I've ordered it twice because it's good.  So it may not look like what you're expecting when you get it, but give it a try.

Collard greens were good.  There seems to be a lot of stems, but then, not everybody  makes the effort to pull some out.  Good flavor!

All in all, this is a convenient spot for good BBQ in the center of downtown Charlotte.  Fortunately for us here in the queen city, we now have two options available!!

If you do go, get the deviled eggs appetizer.  They are good!

One thing to note... if you order a soft drink, you're buying a bottle.  That's it.  So your refills are limited to your bottle.  Want more? Buy another.  I don't care for this approach.

The wait staff was very nice, friendly and informative.  Not terribly attentive, but then they don't have to do refills either. ;-)

So, I like this place and will most likely be back.",3

34550,3,1546560000000,"This is a full service Starbuck's inside the Hualapai at Charleston Smith's. In similar fashion to the host supermarket, it has a Summerlin charm.

Up to the time of this review, this business was invisible on Yelp. Being that tis is the season of giving, I am giving Yelp this hitherto now invisible business listing.

In tis season of giving, this Starbuck's has given me a break on my annual late Autumn hikes on the adjacent Peccole Ranch Walking Trail. Following this tradition, I park at the Sahara West Library before hiking along Grand Canyon Drive and the Peccole Ranch Hiking Trail system that leads me to the Hualapai at Charleston Smith's Starbuck's. With the exception of this year, the weather is cool and Christmasy. The perfect weather to warm up with a warm cup of Starbuck's coffee.

Late Autumn is the best time to savor Starbuck's beverages. Wintery flavors including egg nog join the Autumn Harvesty flavors including pumpkin spice. During this time of year the cafe overlooks the Merry Christmas displays at the Smith's entrance.

Regardless that I have one check in here, I have been here three times in the past before this business listing was born. Every time, I never had a problem finding a place to sit. That is because there is sufficient seating. There is an indoor and outdoor seating area. The indoor seating area includes eight table seats with four leather sofa seats. Service has always been fast and borderline friendly. During the Christmas season, the soundtrack has been Christmas tunes.

Before concluding this live review at the location of the business listing and returning to the Peccole Ranch trail, I will close it off by stating that this is a Smith's owned Starbuck's featuring their own employees and pricing.",2

Juice not fresh pressed - it's all bottled. Who knows for how long? Smoothies though are fresh so I chose one of those.

The first try I asked for local sourced honey - which they seem to promote. When asked after it was made if it was honey instead of agave, employee looked surprised. She wasn't told of my order, so the order taker asked if it was okay to have the agave. Which I had to answer ""No - I ordered honey which is what I want"" I of course have no idea if I actually got honey because they do not make it in front of you like most juice stores.

Second try, I ordered a parfait. After 15 minutes and employee passing out parfaits ordered after mine, I finally said, I think there is a mistake - I never got mine. His reply - Not - So Sorry, but don't worry there are more coming in a completely unapologetic tone. When I received it, it had another ladies name on it.

Ugh....not the point. How about a simple - I'm sorry, I'll get that right out to you!

The seats weren't all filled up, but they were having a hard time getting orders right. We ordered two macchiatos and mistakenly received an espresso instead. As for the cakes, they got frazzled and forgot our order. It took 30-40 minutes just to receive our TWO cakes slices. They don't make them in-house (shipped frozen from NY), so why the wait? They forgot to apologize too.

The green tea mille crepe cake was very light and not too sweet so it was yummy. And one of the ladies were very nice about our couronne cake just being defrosted so we could change it if we would have liked.

I thought... oh he is just cranky and didn't get the flavor he wanted... wrong again.  

One taste of the ""strawberry"" and ""chocolate"" combination made me gag... had I fallen into a vat of cold sweet -n-low?.... then stumbled into a puddle of chilled chocolate flavored baking soda?  I think so.  

I hobbled myself over to the counter, and waited while the ice cream server was being rude to another customer.  When it was my turn, I asked him whether 1) this was a sugar substitute version and 2) if the chocolate was old or stale.  To which he replied 1) no they only use real sugar, and 2) no they make the chocolate fresh every morning.

The pizza was not bad, but it wasn't good either. When you're in a town where pizza places are a dime a dozen and on every corner you have to at least be good. 

The dough was very plain, no flavor. The sauce was watery and also had no flavor. I'm about 90% to 100% sure they use canned mushrooms...yuck! Canned mushrooms are chewy and have almost a snail like texture. The pepperoni, sausage and cheese were good but I think the only thing that saved the pizza was that I had garlic added. I thought the added topping was a little over priced ($1.75) but it did taste like fresh garlic which like I said ""saved the pizza"".

There were good reviews. To each his own. I would hope the owners read this and take it to heart. I'm a huge supporter of small business and try not to buy from chains as much as possible.

We were told we needed to be there by 8pm or we could lose our table.

There was a huge open table with ONE person sitting at it. I find it highly unprofessional that whomever takes reservations double booked our table. MGM owners or not- the properties wouldn't be so successful if it wasn't for the satisfaction of their customers.

Too much grease on the inside of the pieces...even came across some fat blobs...not appealing at all.  In addition to this, the chicken pieces were cold - like they didn't get cooked all the way.

The owner was so eager to sit our party that we didn't even get a chance to look at the games and prices that were offered. It didn't click in until the owner came to us and told us that our game was over. I barley played but had to pay 15 for an hour. Which I think is nuts. I can take $1.50 and play until the game is over. This place is mediocre and the fact that the owner took advantage of the fact that we were naive and new customers makes it even worse. 
Of course we go to bars and expect it to be a certain amount per person. He could have approached it better and mentioned when we called that each game is 1 hour 15 a person. He left out 2 very important parts. He made my experience sour, had he told us all the details we still would have stayed and paid the price but he got greedy.

22875,1,1548547200000,"I have to take away one star off the top because we were heading out for a St. Patty's party weekend and booked the room off Priceline which listed this as a 5 star ON the strip.  I will admit, my bottom lip quivered and tears surfaced when I found out we were staying at a place that was sans casino and off the strip.  Some of the other reviews noted it was walking distance to the strip, but 1) It's not walking distance when it's Vegas Cold or Vegas Hot 2) It's not walking distance for a girl that likes to wear big heels 3) It's not walking distance for someone that doesn't have a Karate Black Belt or their bodyguard with them.  They do have a free shuttle to the Wynn or Caesar's Forum which we used once on our way out, but the final pick up times are far before we are done for the night.  Cab rides to Rio or Paris area were under $10 before tip.

On to the good points:
I agree with all the good comments listed on the reviews here.  Great service, beautiful and smells good in the lobby. We never waited long for the elevators because they split them up so you will go to one elevator entrance if you're on the top third, another if you're on the middle third, etc..  Very nice front desk and valet peeps.  She offered a discount on an upgraded suite and my friend said he only takes free upgrades.  I'm not sure if he charmed her or they were short on rooms, but we got the free upgrade to the one bedroom suite and it was SWEET!  Full kitchen, huge living room, huge room, ginormous bathroom.  If my hubby was with me it would've been better, but I let my friend take the bedroom since he put the reservation on his CC hoping we could swap the next night, but he's not as nice as me, so warning to you shmucks like me, the sofa bed is not heavenly and if you share with someone, they should pay more if they take the bed. Luckily, I drink heavily in Vegas, so I got over it as soon as my head hit the nice pillow. We called housekeeping at 5am to ask where the sheets were, and they came down and actually made the bed for me. Bring your drinks and snacks if you stay here because they they do not have vending machines to stagger to in the early morning hours if you are waking up craving some carbonation.  They do have a small shop with a moshposh of stuff from $300 shoes to $5 can of Pringles, but again, it closes long before I'm heading back to the room. 

The stuff that was ""eh"":
1- No casino.  Did I mention that already?
2- Resort fee $22 per night.  This was lame because it wasn't pool season (in fact they closed it early due to wind and storms) and I didn't need the business center or use the workout room.  So if you calculate your bang for your buck, factor this in.
3-The ""city view"" was the other side of Vegas, as in the scary side, including a nice shot of The Erotic Heritage Museum, an abandoned hotel development, an old cheezy not-so-gentlemen's club and a not far but not walking distance to the side entrance to Circus Circus.
4- The 2nd night our key got deactivated and we had to go back down and to get it reactivated.

I would only stay here again for comfort and pampering or if I was on a business trip.  It would be a good place if I brought my teenage kids and my dogs. Yes, they're dog friendly! The place and the rooms are very nice.  Yes, you can hear the train every once in a while, which is bizarre, but I found it amusing. Those that love coming back to no ding ding ding and no bright lights and no lingering smoke, I get it, but when I come to Vegas, I'm all for all the BS that comes with it.",1

The interior was adequate, with a very long, padded bench for those waiting. There were six televisions, three facing the barber chairs and three facing the people waiting. The temperature was good inside despite an unusually hot day. 

The three girls cutting hair were ridiculously meticulous, which made the wait too long. It's nice to have someone concerned about a good cut but I think it was more lack of experience that caused the wait. We left at 4:05. Too long for a haircut. My barber kept asking for help with my cut from another barber. 

No amenities were offered, like water or whatever. I couldn't partake in the chatter between the barbers and other customers since it was all in Spanish.

Really a good piece of fish with the wrong accompaniment.   My partner's striped sea bass was a colourful hunk of meat, that exuded goodness but disappointed the palate.

42990,1,1547078400000,"Copper is an Indian restaurant located in a former home on East Blvd, as apparently all restaurants on East Blvd were constructed in this manner.  Recently I was in the mood for great Indian cuisine but did not have any desire to sit in a restaurant.  So, having heard mostly positive things about Copper, I made the decision to place an order for pick-up.

Food - I ordered the Khoya Malai Maans which consisted of chunks of lamb in a red curry sauce w/ whole toasted spices. This was accompanied with a pan of basmati rice.  I also ordered the Plain Naan (buttered) and the Saffron, Almond, Paneer Kulcha.  This along w/ a chicken curry dish for my g/f came out to be about $50, which I thought to be extremely expensive.  Maybe I have just been spoiled by the India Garden in Pittsburgh, PA (near the University of Pitt http://www.indiagarden.net/ ) that offers 50% dine-in dinners every night after 11 PM or maybe this was just freakin' expensive!!  Anyway, being that this was so pricey I expected to be blown away.  I was not.  While the g/f's chicken dish was tasty and well made, my dish consisted of diced lamb that was on the tough side.  The spices of the dish were great but tough lamb is something a good Indian restaurant should never have on your plate.  The naan was ""okay"" and the Kulcha was tasteless.  I was left pretty disappointed.

Service - Order was taken promptly over the phone and there were no errors w/ what I had ordered.

Overall - With this experience, I now cannot wait until Thanksgiving week to head over to the Oakland area of Pittsburgh, sit down, and order some very tasty Indian food.  I hope I do not get arrested while there because I now realize the place in Pittsburgh has a steal of a meal.

For North America, to have a hotel with service at this level is unheard of.  It's just a step below full butler service that you'd find overseas.

36048,2,1547164800000,Came here for sunday brunch last week.  Got to sit outside next to the pool area of the Venezia tower.  Perfect day to sit outside.

Food is french/american casual fare done very well.  Scrambled eggs were so creamy and buttery just as an example.

Hobak, I was told from a local, was the #1 Korean restaurant.  I was expecting something a bit cleaner and better than Ginseng or the holes in the wall usually found in Vegas, but instead, I got the real deal that is usually only found in the districts of Gangnam or LA.   It was not only so much cleaner and well maintained along with many servers and an amazing menu, but it blew my mind and had me salivating from the first step in.  

For the price as well, you can't beat it.  I've been paying for sh*t at these prices, but I was so full and even was walking away with so much more. I ordered two meals to go since the quality so much better than what I've been eating for the past 5 days.  I even tipped them 40% because service was that great.

Our Room / suite was spacious and came with a great view . I experienced NO problems 

The Breakfast Buffet . was outstanding for was hot tasty and your able to be in and out in a timely fashion 

The pool area was fantastic .a lot of character and everyone we met where nice 

The court yard walk to the pool was great .. live Flamingos and wildlife . A big fan . waterfalls etc.  

the casino is small and outdated . but there are many other hotels in walking or cab distance to gamble . in fact we probably hit just about every hotel there ..

 we dined at the Venation and the Bellagio as we wanted a upscale atmosphere

""The Ultimate Steak"" platter, 120oz of steak for $250 - DELICIOUS!!!!! -The steak is cut into thin slices for your entire party to enjoy, so you don't have to worry about dividing it up.  We had it medium rare and it came out PERFECT.  Slightly bloody, juicy, and tender.  Just writing this review makes me mouth-water for it!!  

We had a party of 5 guys and 1 girl sharing this and we were all STUFFED w/o any leftovers (keep in mind 3 guys in my party were over 200 lbs).  You can probably get away w/ 7-8 people sharing this monster.  Plus for the price?  $250 seems like a lot but split between 6 people is $40 a head.   Score!!

Sides
Macaroni & Cheese - Above average - The Mac & Cheese is delicious.  It came out baked and was still crunchy (I hate when it's creamy/runny).  Worth it.
Cream Spinach - Average - Wasn't anything memorable, standard spinach.  

Dessert-
NY Style Cheesecake ($10) - Exceptional - This is a delicious dessert!! The cheesecake is rich & thick.  I was amazed w/ every bite I ate.  
Strawberry baked Alaska ($10) - Average.  Don't remember it being any memorable. I'd pass on this.
Grilled Banana Smores ($10) - Below average.  This was ok, but wasn't anything special.  You can buy all the stuff at home for half the price and it'll taste the same.  I'd suggest asking for extra graham crackers tho.

TIPS:
-Bread is complimentary UPON REQUEST.  Ask for bread!  It's delicious too.

35654,1,1548633600000,"I'm a pretty regular Canadian Tire shopper. They're my go-to place for tools. 

This review is for this location's service dept....

First of all, there's nothing personal here. The folks I dealt with were all personable and professional. It's company policy that I have issues with: the policy that says Out-of-Province inspections are a licence to print money. Anything that can be imagined as an issue is to be documented and used to charge the unlucky newcomer as much as possible.

Allow me to elaborate: Less than a year ago, I purchased this 2008 car in Ontario, and it was safety-checked, emission-tested, and passed with flying colours. 

In April it had a complete tune-up and check-up before driving out to Calgary. Once here, my insurance company informed me I had to get Alberta plates if I was here for more than three months, so I paid the government $10 so I could pay $150 or so for an OoP inspection. I made the mistake of listening to the lady at Mojo's (the AB licensed licensing office in the neighborhood), who told me I could save $20 by bringing the car to Canadian Tire. No problem, I thought - the car is in great shape.

And it is, but they failed it. To the tune of $1800 that they wanted on top of the $129 pre-tax inspection charge. And they wanted to sell me new tires all-around, even though they couldn't show me anything beyond normal wear on the first two, and 3 of 4 of the tires. The third we looked at did have a bit of uneven wear - which they jumped on, pulling out the inspection manual to show me that ""ANY EVIDENCE (caps mine) of uneven wear"" was justification to fail me.

To add insult to injury, they didn't even discuss tire options with me. They knew what they wanted to unload on me.

So I asked for the car to be taken down, and I drove away.

PROLOGUE

I contacted the Ministry of Transportation, and they recommended another testing facility. They found an issue with one tire, and that the brakes needed adjusting in the rear, but that they passed (Canadian Tire failed BOTH front and rear). Total cost $600 with a new (and better) pair of tires of my choice.

Two weeks later I was speaking with a co-worker who has recently returned to Calgary from B.C.  He had brought his car to this same location for his inspection - and paid $1800 (coincidence?) to get a pass. Hearing my story, he told me he'd had a complete brake job within the past year, but they'd failed them, and failed his tires as well. He was VERY angry.",2
38137,3,1548806400000,"Holy crap is this place cool.  I'm still thinking about this place and it's the most amazing thing EVER. I never thought i would have had so much fun at an art museum EVER.

I came here on the recommendation of other fellow yelpers and my own desire to see what this place is about.  I got here early, right after opening because I wanted to take the whole thing in at my leisure.  Driving in is beautiful enough with a long windy road full of beautiful gardens.  I parked in the garage and walked in and was blown away at the initial beauty of this place, and it was breathtaking, even in the lobby/entrance area.  I spoke with a lady at the information desk about the layout of the place, and she spend a few minutes going over the map and what to see and do here.  

My first stop was the original museum built many moons ago.  (1916?)  Beautiful art displays of floral paintings, a section of Jesus stuff from all over the world that was hundreds of years old and so much more.  I worked my way slowly through the museum, taking the whole thing in.

Eventually I worked my way throughout, and was impressed at the extensive collection of art from just about every artist ever known.  Some of my favorite displays were Monet, the Persian Tent (HOLY COW that was AWESOME and beautiful!)  The display of the body iron things that people used to wear way back when and much more. Those were a few of the things that still stick out in my mind.

While here, there was a Pharaoh exhibit on loan that was an additional $15. I saved that for last because I wasn't sure if I was going to have the energy to see it with all the ground I had to cover with the rest of the museum.  At the end of my tour, I felt good enough to hit it, and boy, that was pretty cool.  It's not the biggest display, but impressive enough that I'm glad I did it.  

Also, they have a gift shop here, but it's pricey.  A lot of books, with a few other things in here as well. I ended up getting some fridge magnets for myself, but holy cow is this place cool.

48082,3,1546387200000,"---------------CUSTOMER SERVICE REVIEW ONLY--------------
This is a rant but you know what, filter me for all I care but it's a valid rant. 

My first interaction with these folks was an email that said ""RESERVATION CANCELLED""...which was conveniently 3 DAYS BEFORE I'm even set out to fly this weekend. In the email they stated that they tried to get a hold of us because apparently the CC on file kept declining (long story on that but thanks a lot for that one Amex). They tried to get a hold of us?! Shoot, did we miss a call? Did we miss an email? No calls, and after going through all our emails, we found their ONE contact email in our spam folder. 

It was titled ""cc decline"" from Bailey Roberts. Who the hell is Bailey Roberts?  Doesnt even say Jet Luxury Resorts unless you were to open the spam-looking email. Doesn't even bother to capitalize your subject lines (normally I don't care but if you're a professional company, use proper grammar). FROM THE ONSET, THAT ALREADY LOOKS LIKE SPAM and NOT professional. Turns out, the email was sent 24 hours prior that simply said they needed a new card. First off, sucks that it got sent to spam because it LOOKED like spam mail but man, you don't even bother to try a second time?

Here's why I'm really pissed off. This hotel was booked 6 months ago yet they cancelled on us last night. You're telling me we could have easily resolved this in the past 6 months but decided to not let us know there was a problem until the week of?

Btw, the reservation was for this coming weekend which happens to be Memorial Day Weekend. Not sure if you've heard of this holiday but it's pretty big. Which also means, when you're booking a new hotel reservation 3 days away from a big holiday weekend, your prices are now almost 100-120% MORE than what you would have paid if you booked 6 months ago. Should've booked 6 months ago. Oh wait, WE DID DO THAT! And then we got it cancelled on us. 

And yes, it's our bad that we had a CC snafu so I understand that but man, couldn't customer service have tried harder than sending a hapless email?

Thanks but no thanks.",3

It took a few minutes for our server to take our drink orders, iced tea for both of us. It must have been freshly brewed because what little ice there was melted rapidly. We asked for more ice when we finally found our server who was apparently hiding somewhere and was certainly not focused on her job. We had to wait about 40 minutes for our food to arrive and my hubby's  fried chicken was so overcooked, he had to send it back. I ordered the smaller portion meatloaf dinner, and small it was. One slice about the size of a deck of cards, a scoop of potatoes and green beans was on the plate, however it arrived with no gravy on the meatloaf or potatoes.

The sandwich was odd in that it seemed to have all of the correct ingredients yet tasted like nothing.  Texturally the felafel was very good, but it didn't taste like felafel.  It wasn't god awful, but mostly like eating cardboard.  It was like the spice was missing or something... unfortunately very bland.  I had such high hopes too.  The fries were pretty plain.

27554,3,1548806400000,"Location/Service
- Along Queen street (east of Bathurst, west of Spadina), accessible by TTC and car; street parking available and I believe near the side streets as well
- When I went, they're going renovations and the gelato bar is only open; but once they're complete with renos, it will be all vegan gelato with better furniture and interior
- Staff were friendly and nice; you can taste all the flavors before making your selection (which helps a lot!)

Food
- Decided to go with the Pistachio Baklava Yogurt
- Anything pistachio is always a must try in my opinion; and this doesn't disappoint - they use real pistachio (i.e. you can actually taste the nuts) and it's more yellow-ish in colour (green ones are artifical)
- The gelato was very smooth and on sweeter end since it's baklava, but it blended well together with the pistachio; really enjoyed this combo
- Also sampled the raspberry tandori, which is sour and has a good spicy kick at the end (might not be everyone's favourite); cold brew vegan, basically is strong dark coffee, bitter but refreshing


One scoop in a cup was around $5, which is pretty reasonable.
I'll definitely swing by and come back to try their different flavors - like their creativity like Carrot Yuzu, Black Garlic Fennel, Blueberry Lavender Lemonade",2

We were seated a few minutes earlier than expected. I had the salty ricotta plate which came with delicious warm bread and an heirloom tomato and pine nut salad.

Prices are high but worth it.  Let's face it, if you can afford to have a luxury or classic car, then you might as well take care of it with the best service available. I'd put Gloss-It in the best service category.  Rich, the owner, is personally involved in the work and he will make sure your car gets the best detailing available.

We got here before Jet and XS and got a few rounds of drinks. I think we had a few rounds of Henn and Coke. We sat outside on a table and it was pretty nice, but we wanted to go to a busy and loud club so we headed out after about 45 minutes or so.

They have random pieces of art on the wall I mistakenly took for coat hangers...  but the servers are pretty good at seating you and there's a great atmosphere.

Don't waste your time on the spicy potato salad, but pair your meal with sweet tea, sweet potato fries or amazing smoked beans.  They don't joke around with their smoked flavor.

My wife and I live near downtown Phoenix/Mid Town, so when people give us restaurant recommendations to trendy spots, we love to check them out. This place was horrendous. First of all the wait, when we went, there was a line, we later discovered the reason for the line was they had one person on the register. Even though the owner was out shaking hands and getting ready to leave, the second register was never opened. By the time we got to order, 50 minutes had passed and we got to the point of where ""maybe"" the food quality may make up for the horrible wait.

Nope! It took about 5 minutes to actually get our food, so the issue wasn't food prep, it was just the horrible logistics of this business. I ordered a farm burger, medium with bacon and cheese. What I got resembled something that had been marinated in grease for about 12 years then under cooked and served on a delicious bun, but 2 minutes into the meal the bun resembled a soggy rag. The fries had a weird taste to them, I ended up not eating my meal. My wife got through about half of her burger before she complained about the greasiness.

I put the burger quality on par with an in-and-out, smash burger, five guys style burger. However, would you wait 30+ minutes for one of those? No, so I will never return here and I will chalk up all of the recommendations for this place to, suburb folks that have never experienced real dining.",2

Some of those houses are now trendy shops and restaurants, but I can remember a time actually being in them when people lived there.  Yes I'm THAT old.

But there's always character and charm in a street that seems to have a bit of history, narrow, tree lined and packed. It reminds me a bit of St. Marks in New York, although less busy.

Cafe La Gaffe is fittingly one of those charming places.  We came for the Summerlicious lunch, to which I've basically stopped going places with a summerlicious prix fixe (another discussion for another time).  This time around, the service was toot quick.  Beef Carpaccio, Grilled Salmon, and a Creme Brulee to boot were all decent, but nothing spectacularly memorable.  My only complaint was that the Brulee was obviously rushed.

I am a mall employee, after working ten hours that day I went in for a Manicure & Pedicure, I arrived about 8:30pm  and asked if it was enough time they assure me that it was most certainly enough time, as I set in the chair I was offered something to drink, I chose a glass of wine, then I was handed a menu of the services, this was my first visit so I chose the Basic Mani & Pedi which was $35.00, five minutes into my services I notice that both of my feet had been done with no effort and with minimum work done, when I question her about her services, she replied that I chose the minimum price and by the service rendered it seemed as if I was going to get as less done on my feet as possible. I get manicures and pedicure twice a week, and this wasn't even a basic one I was not enjoying it at all so when I stated to complain she stated speaking another language to another employee , so I decided that I would leave and go some where else, keep in mind that at this point I had only been there for six minutes and both of my feet were what they considered finished, this was my first SIX MINUTE pedicure. As I got up to walk to the door the male owner ran and locked me inside, he was screaming , yelling, and making all kinds of  gestures at me and refuse to let me go saying that I drink the dirty water so I must pay, I'm  assuming the dirty water was the complimentary glass of wine that I had during my SIX MINUTE visit. Long story short..... a male customer walking by witness what was going on and made the owner let me go. I called the police and they said that it was a Civil  Matter. This was by far the most horrible experience I have ever!!! experienced in my life.

I primarily take a ballet class there with a wonderful instructor named Portia Wade.  She teaches all the ballet classes there.  She is great and the ballet classes are great!  I take various ballet classes around the city and this is the only one where my teacher actually offers corrections.  She gives one on one advice to each student.  She inspired me to go further with my new hobby and I am better for it.

I find that some of those relaxing parts of my day are spent in my ballet class or in the shower afterwards.  There is always shower availability - even during peak times (read - January New Year's Resolution people).  There are also always full length lockers available and the charge rooms are nice and warm in the winter so you don't freeze tottering back to get dressed.

However; tonight, we made dinner reservations and got there early around 5:30 pm and wanted to get a glass of wine and wait on our friend at the bar like many times in the past.

Surprisingly, they had blocked off about 20-30 seats ""reserved by casino hosts"" at the bar and surrounding tables, previously ""first come first serve"" for people wanting to stop in for happy hour drinks.

Nor only that, the 4 waitresses that alternate around were rude and snobby and I was SHOCKED at the massive downgrade in customer service at my once favorite local fine dining and happy hour spot.

There was NO WHERE to even sit with all the empty reserved spots and we were told that happy hour drinks could not be purchased in the main dining area {2 hours to go of happy hour mind you.}

The level of poor customer service was just over the top that I wasn't about to pay for dinner there, and we headed over to Flemings in Town Square.

I got a chance to walk around the perimeter of the restaurant and it is so beautifully styled on the outside.  There are several outside seating areas.  Because it was a little chilly that night, there was a fire burning in the fire pit.  The restaurant is lovely on the inside.  the atmosphere is not very intimate in my opinion, but it is absolutely stunning and appealing all the same.

We had our drinks at the bar and were seated for our dinner service.  When going to an establishment like this, we both usually know what we want, definitely my friend wants a bone-in Filet.  I will generally order sea bass.  Unfortunately, they were out of the bone-in filet.  I actually called ahead to question the availability of the bone-in and they did inform me that they did not have any but we decided to go there anyway because we'd never been.  My friend ordered the bone-in Ribeye and I ordered the Sea Bass.  Oh, for the appetizer, we ordered the beets and double cut bacon.  Oh boy did we like the bacon!  LOL.  if you know me, that should come as no surprise.  

My seabass was just average.  My friend was quite unhappy with his bone-in Ribeye as it was somewhat too charred on the exterior for his taste.  I personally prefer a steak cooked rare/Pittsburgh blue/black and blue/basically cool rare.  I could never eat that.  The meat itself tasted average to me as well.

if I could give them 3.5, I would, but I can't give them a 4 because they didn't have 2 things we wanted from the menu on that day and we were somewhat underwhelmed by the tastes of the food.

they were, however, kind enough to comp us desert that night because we wanted things on the menu that they were out of and because of a couple other misfortunes that don't warrant discussing.  I think it was a cream cheese cake.

Definitely loved the popovers!  I wish I could bake that.  i wonder if anyone has ever made that recipe.  If so, please message me and let me know how it turned out!

About 15 minutes after we ordered a man came out and said that they were out of the dough that we ordered and asked if they could make us something else. We agreed. When they brought the pizza they gave us coupons for two free meals the next time we were there.

The pizza was decent. I thought it had good flavor but was pretty greasy.

My view has changed after being treated so rudely by one of their workers when I was in the building close to closing. I understand that the building is set to close at 10 pm and I was fully aware of the time but I found it unnecessary to badger me and hover in the area waiting for me to leave. I was using my computer and typing furiously to get my important document sent before closing and a woman kept interrupting me to tell me they were closing and if ""I knew what time it was."" When she proceeded to stay in the area and stare at us, that was the last straw and I left promptly at 9:55 pm. 

I myself work at a bookstore and I would NEVER treat anyone as rudely as this person treated me. I felt rushed, uncomfortable, and unwanted after that experience. I don't plan to go back anytime near closing because I don't want this to happen again and I'm not a confrontational person. But if you are a place of business and your sign says clearly open until 10 pm, please don't badger your customers to leave prior to that.

Considering the amount of problems with the room really makes me question the integrity and upkeep of the rooms. It is a No Smoking facility which can be appreciated.,2

It was a guy the first time and he was either in a bad mood or having a bad day but he was very rude and actually forgot to make my drink I had to remind him once I realized he hadn't even started it (it wasn't even busy.) I was going to drink my drink and eat my scone there but the service was so bad I decided it would be better to walk home and enjoy it there instead. On the up side the vanilla latte was delicious and their scones were great! I just wish the service was friendlier  I went again trying to give it a second chance, but that time it was an older woman and she was distant as well and was having a conversation with another customer the whole time I was trying to order, it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable so I once again just walked home to eat instead of staying there.",1

I remember their huge refrigerator off to the side as a kid and that thing is still alive and kickin! It's definitely outdated but it's totally the charm of the place. 
Now for the food. I'm not gonna lie, I used to be extremely picky as a kid and would only get the teriyaki chicken or the house chicken. Now as an adult I've ventured off and tried new things. I think I've had everything on the menu at least once throughout my lifetime. My favorite dish currently is the Emperor's Favorite, chicken and shrimp with mixed veggies in a spicy white sauce. Yum! The soups are also amazing. I'm a huge fan of egg drop soup and Wong's just knows how to do it. If I were you I would also try the egg rolls, so good! and only $1 per egg roll!

It gets really packed n crazy busy here so one time I was very upset cuz my food was taking longer than normal. An hour wait. I was pissed cuz I was starving but the general manager Andre knew how to defuse the situation n took care of my entire party. He came by our table personally and explained the situation n apologized. And for us waiting so long, he got us a round of drinks. Now that's how a manager should be.

I like restaurants that are dog friendly because I'm a dog lover. The girl who waited on us was very nice and sweet (Oh, I feel bad now). Patio seating area was spacious and comfortable.
Everything was amazing except for the food I had.

Salad... Fresh and crisp looking outside. Inside of it was just soggy pieces. I thought they put seaweed inside (Serious).

Chicken Piccata... I tasted nothing but white wine and lemon. I had to put a ton of salt to eat it. Never tasted chicken piccata this gross in my life.

Dog meat ball... Way too salty to give to any dogs unless you want your dogs to have their blood pressure skyrocket. Yes, I tasted it like I always taste anything I give to my dogs. 

Dog dessert.... The ice cream was definitely for human. Well, it was much sweeter than my Haagen dazs vanilla ice cream. Of course my dog loved it. Hope she doesn't get diabetes.

They were out of Veal and turkey meat balls.
Maybe everything tasted great if I had a bottle of red wine or two like the other couple that was sitting across from us. Too bad I didn't drink this time. Next time, I'll come back with a designated driver :-)",2

We ordered the lamb chop hash (medium rare) off the easter menu. It wasn't a hash at all, just two very rare chops on top of potatoes. A hash is diced up meat cooked WITH potatoes, not just put on top. I like rare meat, but the chops were very rare, I should have sent them back. 
The biscuit it came with was very dense and dry. 

My mom ordered the fried chicken benedict. You couldn't even tell it was a benedict, it was just a mountain of food piled together. It didn't even look appetizing. Lastly was the cobb salad which wasn't bad, but not great either.

I was then greeted by tall and gorgeous hostesses. The moment I stepped in the restaurant, I was continuously in awe with the decor and furniture. 

Ambience: The ambience was really relaxed and intimate. The dimmed lighting and soft background music  made it feel romantic in a way. I definitely recommend this for first dates, second dates, third dates, girls night, etc.

Service: The service was excellent, I had about 4 different staff check up on me to see if everything is ok and if I would like to order another drink. Even though the restaurant got really busy, they didn't rush me at all and I was there for about 2 hours just enjoying the decor, food, and drink.

Food: one word, AhMaaaaZinggg! I had the grilled cheese tomato soup dumpling which consisted of 6 dumplings on a spoon and the grilled mushroom pizzetta (goat cheese, truffle oil, herbs, and mushrooms). I paired that with the platinum peacock (virgin cocktail).

I've never stayed at the hotel so I'm writing this review strictly on the casino. It is by far my favorite casino in the Las Vegas area. Now, I should admit that I never play slots, and no, not because I think they're for ""suckers"" I just don't enjoy them. (Let's be honest, if you gamble at all... you're a bit of a sucker... these places aren't made of solid gold for no reason :-) Back to business; right when I walked in, I knew that it was going to be my kind of place. It's never ridiculously crowded. The drink servers greeted me right away and took my order. The table limits allow you to play at the level YOU decide you are comfortable with. Also, if you're a dice player, this is the only casino in Nevada that I've noticed has a Fire Bet. There is a great, reasonably priced food court if you want to grab a bite to eat and don't feel like taking out a 2nd on your house. It really is the ONLY place I feel comfortable gambling at in Nevada. 5 stars for the Jolly Green Giant.

We ordered a bowl of soup, flatbread, arugula salad and chicken meatballs.  We asked our waiter to bring everything out at once so we could share.  We then waited over 30 minutes for our soup and salad to arrive.  Ouch.  Every table around us was being served while we watched and wondered where our remaining items were (meatballs and flatbread).  And we waited. And we waited. Without apology, our last two items showed up after the salad and soup were long gone--at least 30 min later.  By then it was over the acceptable wait time and the patio chairs became uncomfortable and the other patron's smoke started to annoy us.  We had intended to go in for a few appetizers and got stuck in service hell.   In hindsight, I should've spoken with the manager but we were in a hurry to get out of there.  Enough was enough.   Definitely the slowest, most irritating service we've had in Vegas in a long time.

Lovely seat by a window in a relatively private booth.
Service was attentive and expedient. However, there was a bit of disdain in the waiter's voice when we inquired about the daily specials (as laid out on the website and menu) as well as the soup of the day. All had run out for the day :( According to the waiter we should have been there by noon to have any expectation of trying a special :(

I ordered the jerk chicken caesar salad - an interesting take on a classic. It was made more interesting by the addition of corn and beans (not something I would have put on my salad, and I probably won't be replicating this at home). 

Both the chicken on my salad and the fish order by my colleague were dry - as though they were prepared for the noon rush and merely leftover when we arrived at 1pm. I guess the silver lining is that our meals were on the table much more quickly than expected.

Over all, this experience was a little below my expectations for the location, prices, and reputation. Perhaps I will give Jump another try when it isn't the end of a shift in order to try the specials and find a more congenial waiter.

Unfortunately, Maison Kam Fung fell short like many other places outside of New York and San Francisco. First a quick observation was that this was actually the first Chinese restaurant I've been to where they actually have seating for 2 at a Dim Sum restaurant, which was interesting. The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor and pretty much occupies the corner of the building. It's pretty spacious still, but was crowded on a Friday morning when I went.

Much of the Dim Sum that we ordered was just not up to the standards I was used to in NY, but it might be a matter of preference because the stuffing in the items were not what I expected. Many of their dishes were stuffed with pork, which is not what I'm used to. The spring rolls are actually just smaller egg rolls. They did serve the usual dishes you will see, such as Ha Gao, but still the selection seemed to be lacking some items. On the bright side though, their egg custards were very good with the crispy flaky crust and they offered the coconut squares which I love!

Although the food was disappointing, it was not surprising, since Montreal is not known for their Dim Sum or Chinatown. If you're looking for quality Dim Sum in Canada, Toronto is probably where you'll find it, not Montreal.",2

They re-wrote the card and it STILL was not exactly what I asked to have written on the card but it was close enough so we just dealt with it instead of going all the way back again. Considering I paid extra for that card to be included with the cake I would think they would pay attention to detail. If it's too difficult to type what I asked for, they should have just copied and pasted what I wrote. No one was overly thrilled with the taste of the cake and for the price I could have done better.

It wasn't until I blatantly asked him ""are you having a bad day or something?"" that we actually got any attention...",2

20161,1,1546732800000,"Now there is pizza ( Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc. ) then there is New York Pizza. This place is the only place that I have found so far in Vegas that has pizza that reminds me of NY. They even sell pizza by the slice. The place is nice with about 10 tables and old pictures of the owners house and family back in NY. The have a huge menu of Italian favorites as well as pizza. When you first walk in to order grab a Zeppoli ( fried dough ball topped with powdered sugar ) for a free sample taste while you ponder the menu. I ordered 2 slices one pepperoni and sausage and one white margarita. The pepperoni and sausage was excellent. Not those little sausage balls used at other places but real Italian sausage thinly sliced so when heated it becomes a little crispy. The pizza was thin and crispy and the crust was crispy on the outside but soft and chewy in the middle. The white pizza was to die for. No tomato sauce instead they use olive oil. Then topped with mozzarella and ricotta cheeses, fresh tomato chunks and basil. WOW. I love a good white pizza. This place has the best pizza in Las Vegas. The owner is very friendly and the pizza is great. If you are looking for authentic NY Pizza this is your place.",1
23200,1,1548892800000,"Some relatives and I were staying in the area for the night and this place was in our price range. Despite the tacky lights outside, we completely passed by this place due to it being on the lower level. Also apparently, I pronounced the name of this restaurant wrong and everyone thought I was saying the name of a very prestigious university in China.
As we inched towards the restaurant, I knew all of us felt the same vibe -- it was the feeling of uncertainty mixed with a little panic. I could tell because everyone was walking slower and slower. Do we really want to eat here?  It appeared completely empty.  Doubts were expressed but Yelp wouldn't let me down! So we walked inside.  I was relieved to find a second, more occupied room that we originally could not see through the window, but that feeling immediately dissolved upon doing my classic race-check.  Seeing only white people in a Chinese restaurant is always a little unsettling if you've come expecting good Chinese food

We ordered 90 dumplings total for the six of us. Half were fried; the rest were steamed or boiled.  I even liked the chicken/mushroom dumpling I had and I normally hate mushrooms (blegh!)
These dumplings don't require any sauces to make them taste good.  They're really juicy and if you bite into them just right, juice will squirt out the other side and into your cousin's eye.  If you don't like fitting an entire dumpling in your mouth, you can also take a super small bite and suck out the juices before you eat the rest. I've made a lot of dumplings in my time but I have no idea how they manage to make every single dumpling sealed with juices.

The dumplings were really light in terms of salt (just the way I like them) so if you do want to add some sauce, I recommend dipping your dumplings in a mixture of 3/4 soy sauce and 1/4 red chili sauce (half of it being the chili oil and the other half the chili).  I'm not a big fan of vinegar but I was told to put at least a few drops in it because that's what you're supposed to do for dumplings.

Our food came relatively quickly but they did seem understaffed in terms of service.  The waitress was so busy that I couldn't flirt with her--I was very disappointed about that.  There was another guy at the cash register who helped out with our order and when we asked for refills for our tea (I winked at him twice).

15 dumplings will cost around $10. They charge an extra $1.50 for fried dumplings, which surprised us a little at the end. Fried dumplings filled with pork and cabbage was my favorite of the bunch, followed by steamed shrimp dumplings.  Definitely don't be fooled by its appearance and try this place out!",2

When the sushi came we did not have soy sauce nor the little plates for soy sauce. They forgot my friend's miso soup and the server was not very attentive. The sushi rolls were pretty good. The cauliflower entree was not very intuitive to eat with chopsticks--basically half a cauliflower. They were very cool with my friend's niece who just turned 21.

Hope all is well! I ate there today with my wife and had the worst experience!
 I believe the managers name is Mike. While we were waiting with others on the bench.I saw this guy insulting and harassing his own staff. I saw him yell and berate a waitress by the name of Nancy! I am in the same buisness and never in a million years I talk to my staff in the tone or unprofessional  manner  he does.   Reprimanding should be in private not on public display for the customer to hear and see! I heard him tell her"" if you can't wait on people just go home ! And pointed at the door. She tried to explain her self . Mind you this is all happening at the front podium were you check in with the hostess. She tried to explain and he gave her the T with his hands referring to her to stop talking.Then starts talking about Nancy with Hostess an older lady with violet short hair and wear glasses who yells people's names out like she works at a truck dinner off the I-90 !!! Honestly I've thought seen it all! Our waitress Gabby was great and very kind hearted. But I feel IHOP is doing a disservice by keeping Mike and the gossip mill Hostess  around and should really evaluate about getting a more professinal assistant manager! By the way. I'm calling Shawn the store manager on Friday when he gets back from vacation . I can't beleive people like this represent such a fine company!
   Sorry for the long story !!! To the staff at the IHOP!!! Stop suffering in silence. Work should be fun not degrading. This happened on a Thursday I can only imagine Mike on a Sunday he must be Epic. Mike not to be mean but being an assisant manager of a resturant is not your calling! Im just saying .Corprate should give this guy a climate survey!!!!!!!
 "" There's micro management and then on the other spectrum there's  harassment""

34216,3,1547942400000,"I wanted to give a good review, I wanted to have a good experience, but I just can't and didn't. 
First off, the parking is a nightmare. In Vegas, we all want to be treated like royalty. I enjoy valet and always valet in Vegas. We pull up to valet on a Friday and the valet is full....okaaayyyy. I have a whole car loaded down with suitcases and such, can I pull up to the curb for a bellboy? Sure! Just got wait in the that huge mile long line and we will get to you when we can. Really?! So we get in the huge line (think Orange County on a Friday evening), and after 15 minutes without moving, we get tired of waiting and decide to park the car and haul all our crap with us. 
Then we finally get inside, so I prop my husband up like a hobo to watch our bags while I check in. The line is LONG! I mean, like Disneyland long! Like, DMV long. Like  WT* long!! So I wait and wait and wait...meanwhile the man of Asian descent standing  in front of me is farting non stop. It smelled like old sushi, not that it's flamingos fault. But, when you stand there smelling rotten tuna, you start pointing fingers. So I finally get up front! Yay! After a minute of clicking on the computer, she picks up the phone and starts chatting with someone. I think JACKPOT, I might get an upgrade! Oh no, she called her friend and sat there giggling and complaining about her long shift. No wonder the line isn't moving. Meanwhile, the people checking in next to me were using their time to flirt and talk about their lives...cool bro. So anyways, no upgrade, just a nice long opportunity to listen to her on the phone. I had used a promo code when I booked my room, and I asked her about it. She said ""oh, I don't know about those"". Then, I asked her to break a $100, and she didn't have change. What?!!!!!!!! 
Whew! Let's drop our bags, and party...I need a drink after that checkin! In the elevator we go!!! Oh! What's going on? The elevator just hopped, no..FELL like one or two floors, made a crazy noise and then started again. Everyone on the elevator was screaming and one girl was crying!! Yes crying! So we get out of the death trap and find out room. 
**meanwhile, the girl crying said she was going to management immediately. The entire time we stayed (4 days), that elevator remained open and we heard more people talk about the crazy stuff it was doing. I avoided it like the plague. More complaints, still stayed open. 
Our room was fine. It looked like a porno set, but it was clean and functional. Whatever. 

I am giving two stars bc, I'm a giver. But here are some more complaints:
-the front side, facing the strip, smells like urine..everywhere. But it could be all the homeless. But, with all the money flamingo rakes in, couldn't they clean the urine off? 
-no customer service, like at all. Freaking no VIP treatment anywhere!!! I'll be taking my business to MGM or Mandalay Bay. 

Perks: we had a great time at the pool. I made my hubby stand in line at about 7:45 and we got a great spot when the pool opened at 9 am (Saturday). Sunday and Monday we got in fast, no wait.

All in all, never will I give my business to Flamingo. It was so unprofessional and such a disappointment. In fact, I may be disputing charges, bc my card was charged way too much, just to add the cherry on top.",2

31539,3,1547078400000,"First of all this is not an authentic japanese restaurant. It's hawaiian restaurant that serves japanese-hawaiian fusion food.

Food was so so towards good/ok. 

Was asking for a booth. Said that all the booth are reserved. But no body was on the booth that near our table. Ask the receptionist after done eating now they said all that three back tables can't be used (closed). It's just weird and very unprofessional. At least explain to the customer why those tables can't be used and apologize for us not getting our booth.

Timing for the food was very off. My husband got his soup and salad and only literally couple seconds later his tonkatsu is delivered. But our sushi appetizer haven't even come and I have to wait quite a while until my spicy tuna bowl is delivered.
Food tasted ok. Had better elsewhere. Value for your non-sushi food is good. But value for the sushi is overrated. Specialty sushi rolls that we ordered were sloppy. Fish wasn't cut uniformly on the roll. Sushi rice was falling off the roll, it's like it wasn't tightly rolled. For $11-13 per roll, I expect better. Especially with a lot of AYCE sushi options in the town of Las Vegas.
 
Our waiter John was nice. He recognized the timing was off and apologized for it. Good guy. Gave him decent tip for it.

-Location, location, location. Flamingo is centrally located and in easy walking distance to basically everything. 
-Food. I did get food poisoning from the Cafe by the habitat elevators after eating their pizza. Carlos and Charlies is just ok, Margartitaville is cheesy and great. 
-Pools. Both trips now the pools have been closed. However, I appreciate being able to use the neighboring properties (Paris, Linq, Ceasers).
-Flamingo habitat. I really liked seeing all of the exotic birds and other creatures. They seem to be well cared for and I do hope that's the truth.
-Rooms. We have experienced both the outdated old rooms as well as the newer GO rooms. My husband preferred the older room simply because of it's size. It was at least twice the size of the GO room we stayed in. However, I found that room to be old (duh), dark, and way too far from the elevator. Basically a full  5 minute walk to our room. I really liked the GO room. We had a great view of the High Roller and gardens, the electronic shades were great, plenty of closet and dresser drawer space, and much closer to the elevator. We upgraded at our checkin this time around ($15 a day) to get that room which I wasn't thrilled with but I didn't want to end up in that old, smoky, dingy room again!

I ordered the Taco, Enchilada and Tostada combo, with an order of rice. The chicken taco (as all my items were chicken) was delicious! The enchilada was full of chicken as was the tostada. The rice was perfect for me. The taste was authentic and tasted just like my family makes.

My friends and I definitely enjoyed our time at La Cabana and can't wait to head back to try the Fajita warming grills! What a great idea for a Friday GNO or just a big b-day party!

Ordered half a dozen oysters for $16. Got 3 differ by kinds (2 of each). All were very tasty. The horseradish was super pungent. Awesome! Weird thing is that half a dozen oysters was $16, while a full dozen would have been $34...is it just me or does the math not add up?

Even though it was 94 degrees outside, the waiter told me the clam chowder pot pie is just too good to pass up so I had to get it. And I'm so glad I did! The pie crust was the perfect amount of flakiness. The chowder was not as thick as most I've had but still very tasty. So many clams! And the bits of bacon just really added to the flavor. 

The prices were decent. A little bit pricy but very reasonable for a seafood restaurant. I was hesitant at first since the restaurant was so empty but very glad I took a chance on it. 

Only weird thing was while I was sitting in the patio area a homeless(?) man came by trying to sell me a CD of his rapping. Totally random and unexpected.

The two star rating is reflective of my experience in the room itself.  First off, the mattress sucked.  I've stayed at several strip hotels that have extremely plush, comfortable mattresses (Encore, Wynn, Palazzo, THEhotel, etc..)  This one was hard and felt cheap.  Second, I turned the shower on and realized the knob's hot switch was actually the opposite of what it says...Not a huge deal but when you expect a certain standard to be met, it is very noticeable.

24910,2,1548720000000,"I have been wanting to go to BT for awhile now so I was excited when my bf took me out to dinner here. BT has an interesting balance of hip and neighborhood restaurant. Not so hip where it's a flash in the pan business that will be gone in less than a year but you have to wait an hour for a table and spend $100 on dinner, and not so neighborhood that you would wander there every week, possibly in those sweatpants you should never own. It's both cool and cozy, and I think they will be sticking around for quite some time, they've already made it past their year mark. 

I ordered a Palmaire, which was a tasty cocktail, and my bf had the Four Peaks Pumpkin Porter, cheers to BT for having that on draft! Then I had the short rib, which was very tasty, but watch out for those onions! Who wants that kind of breath? My bf had the grilled cheese and upgraded to the bowl of tomato soup. He enjoyed it. The food was pretty good, it's not OMG I just died great, but it's good. The staff is very friendly, which is always appreciated. There were a handful of things on the menu that I wanted to try, so that's a good way to keep me coming back. 

The one thing I would say is that they need to figure out their layout. The chairs are close enough together that their servers are constantly turning sideways to squeeze through and I kept thinking I needed to scoot in or I got bumped a few times. So they need to move some things around and have the space work a little better. Oh, and their crowd...well it's quite a few people over 50 in there. Which I guess is kinda fitting because I would def take my parents there, but I think trying to attract a younger crowd would be nice. Maybe they should add a happy hour and open a little earlier. I think I will be back. Plenty more food to try, good atmosphere, good price.

Ok I've been a few more times and wouldn't go back at this point. The staff never tells you the specials, you have to find it on the tiny chalkboard next to the bar on your own. The food is ok but rarely great. The vibe and interior decor is great but other areas need improvement.",1

Despite being one of only two tables in the entire restaurant (on a Friday night when restaurants are supposed to be at their busiest), it took over 10 minutes for the waitress to come and ask us about drinks. Our entrees came with salad and soup: when the salad was brought out, both salads contained nothing but brown lettuce that was covered in dressing (presumably to hide the fact that the lettuce was expired). When we brought it to our waittress' attention, she took it away and never offered to replace it; this wouldn't have been a problem, except the couple seated behind us also received salads that contained fresh, green lettuce.

34214,2,1547683200000,"This Dunkin is really close to work, so if I'm running too late to make breakfast, it is convenient.  Here's the ""HOWEVER"":

In short, it's bad.

The building is placed so that the drive through is awkward. The trash can at the end of the drive through lane is too far away for a normal human arm to reach. The U-shaped parking lot to the north isn't the easiest to maneuver either, mostly when it is busy.  It is safer to park to the northeast in shared complex parking. The exterior seating is usually not very clean. The interior of the restaurant is normally pretty clean though. The interior setup is just like other Dunkins. Nothing special, just average.

The chai that I get is pretty hard to mess up, since I think it is steamed milk and a powder base. I've been pretty lucky there. But the food and doughnuts have been awful. It is usually stale, hard, overcooked or ill-prepared (messy).

Today, I ordered at the drive through, and had to repeat ""large hot chai and a bacon wakeup wrap"" three times. Dude sounded like he was sleeping and I woke him up. I pull to the window, and wait. Mind you, I am the only one in line. A gal takes my payment with no fanfare, and hands me a receipt. The window closes, and I wait. My drink appears. I hear the man yell ""Oh, I need a wrap."" Since I'm solo in line, I'm guessing they already forgot about me. The window closes. The window opens and I am told to pull around front so they can make my wrap. I eke into a spot in the dreaded parking lot. And I wait. I get through the long version of Ram Jam's Black Betty before my wrap comes out. The gal was nice and apologized for the wait.

So, let's talk about the bacon wakeup wrap. A baby flour tortilla with a pre-made egg patty, a slice of cheese and a piece of bacon torn in half. Simple, right? It is a mess visually. I take a bite. I check to make sure all teeth are intact and accounted for. This thing is so hard! I tap it and it makes a sound like tapping a pencil on a counter. Probably shouldn't do that. I'm hungry and not a fan of wasting food, so I eat the inside and wash it down with the chai.

I keep stopping here for convenience, but am disappointed every time. Why do I do this to myself? Why is the sky blue? How is a rainbow made? It just is. In 2018, I need to resolve to stop settling for junk, and drive a block to Bosa, for fresh stuff from a local joint.",2

22672,1,1546300800000,"Decided to give this place a try as we were in the mood for some good burgers!

Location & Aesthetics -- Located just off E. Camelback Road just opposite The Container Store that's off N. 20th St.  It could be a little difficult to miss from the main streets but with a handy GPS you should be fine.  Once in the parking lot, and there's plenty of available parking, you can't miss the restaurant with it's large signage.
There's available seating on the outside and inside, but this time of the year, most folks were seated inside.  I can't remember if I saw misters for the patrons dining outside.  
Restaurant is clean (outside and inside) and well lit indoors.  Noise level was acceptable with music playing at a comfortable decibel level.
There is a central bar area with bar stools and, of course on the periphery of the restaurant, seating all around.  Seating was booth-like and very comfortable with spacious tables.

Service -- Staff are very friendly.  The concept of being seated and ordering is quite unfamiliar to me so I was a bit lost on the customs of the restaurant.  Thankfully staff instructed me what I had to do.  
When you enter, you immediately join the queue to order your food.  Once you're at the front of the queue, staff will either call you up to take your order providing there's an available table.  You give them your order and they'll show you your table.
If there aren't any available tables, then they will let you know and basically, everyone who's waiting for a table (versus folks there for takeaway), has to stand and wait in line (no orders are taken) until a table opens up then the line moves again.  Very interesting concept which I've never experienced before and do like.

Menu -- Lots of available menus at the door when you enter.  The menu was one sheet, both sides, and very easy to understand with lots of descriptions.  We had questions on portion sizes on some items on the menu and staff was exception at helping us decide.

Food -- I had the classic burger with the bacon and cheese (Angus Beef, green leaf lettuce, white onion, tomato, and something called Sassy Sauce).  Sides are extra so we shared a large Kennebec fries, with a sea-salt caramel shake.
Working backwards, the shake was rich, creamy and semi-thick (not too thick that you'll need a vacuum to suck it through the straw) though they will provide you with a plastic spoon in addition to the straw.
The Kennebec fries (in case you don't know is from the medium-to-late-maturing white potato) was fresh, hot, and slightly salted which made it perfectly delicious!
The burger itself was fresh, non-greasy, non-drippy, well seasoned, juicy, tasty, and very flavorful!
With the wide variety of burgers they have on the menu, I will most likely be back to try some of the other options on the menu and do definitely recommend!  I've also heard they serve a mean watermelon mojito so that will be accompanying my next burger order on my return!",2

The lobster was chewy and stringy, so it being served cold with a glob of mayo was incredibly unappetizing; we threw it out after one bite each. The Connecticut roll was a little better because it's served warm but the lobster was still chewy and stringy. The bread was the best part of both sandwiches. It was a bummer, but at least we got to try it.",2

Pretty quickly we both came to the conclusion that Superior Pho is, well...superior. Superior has a bit more flavor and definitely better flavor.

The plate was nicely presented.  The eggs were perfectly poached.  The accompanying (roasted?) potatoes were soft on the inside, but had a hard exterior...I couldn't cut the potatoes with the butter knife.  I had their regular brewed coffee and it was ok - have had their cappuccinos and expressos in the past and they were excellent. Had also tried their ham and cheese croissant on a separate visit and it was really good - if you can't decide on what to order, a croissant is always a sensible choice.

Overall, this is a good place to go to as your first stop if planning a day in the Old Port.  

I always walk out of there with a purchase from their boutique - teas, coffee, chocolates, syrups.  You can also pick-up pre-packaged food if you don't intend to dine-in.

Separate comment:
One oddity that I experience each time that I come here is that I always feel so out of place...(maybe because I look real young?  maybe because I am anglophone?  maybe because ...?)...",3

The Suite was located in the North tower, where all rooms have been renovated. When we got to the room we were suprised by how clean and modern the room was. The room was as good as it gets for the prive, the bedroom was huge!

VIP was very flexible in terms of menu options (you can bring your own desserts) and decorations (again, can bring your own).  The night of the party also happened to be the first/only (?) major snowstorm this winter, but the party was so fun and laid-back that we barely noticed the brutal weather outside.

The food (4/5): Noodles are al dente, and the wontons are huge! Wontons are filled with large shrimp and the wonton wrapper holds its own. Love the soup here, will def be back. I'd warn against getting anything other than the wontons though, especially the beef... The beef is really chewy and frankly not the best cut. The Gai Lan is a nice to have on the side, but again, nothing special than what you can prepare for yourself at home lol. Wontons all the way! Last tip, their hot chilli oil is LEGIT. By legit, i mean REALLY HOT. If you want to add it to your soup , do so in small amounts. Test it first because I put in too much the first time... and had to order another soup because I was an idiot and misjudged the oil lol.

Price (4.5/5): $5 for awesome giant wontons in noodle soup?! Its a steal for a quick and hearty meal!

Service (4/5): Straight and right to the point. In and out is their style. Nothing to complain about here, pretty standard Chinese service :) They only serve soup and Gai Lan here so you'll get your food REALLY quick! Just a note that the water and tea is self serve (it's at the back!)

Ambience (3.5/5): Their walls are lined with a repeating menu of soups and the tables are pretty plain. It's a decent size for larger groups and as clean as a standard Chinese restaurant. Nothing to complain about here!",2

At 16$ with tax, I'd say the price tag says ""treat"". The service was nice and friendly and the service was pretty fast. It wasn't very busy that definitely helped I'm sure. 

On to the food. Unfortunately that's were it fell flat for me. The tiny hot dog bun was nicely toasted but super greasy. The lobster portion was just ok, certainly not worth the price in my opinion. Most importantly though, the taste was bland and very forgettable. I don't know why, but the lobster had none of it's natural flavour. No hint of sweetness or freshness that lobster should have, just a bit of heat from the mayo/dressing they use. If I would have closed my eyes there is no way I'd know I was eating lobster. 

I may try the fish tacos next time, but I won't be fooled by the overpriced, underwhelming lobster roll again.",2

Located on Queen St West, you will find parking at a nearby green P about a block or two away. 

The service was prompt and genuinely friendly. 

The food is ok. I ordered a rice bowl of chicken and rice. It came with a tiny salad and miso soup. There were ligaments on the chicken which I didn't like and the egg a were a little on the wet side. 

The table next to us ordered the soup with muscles and shrimp. It looked so good. So if I ever go to this place again that is what I will order. 

Pricing, I would say a bit over priced for the meal I ordered.  But it is in a busy area so it's expected. 

Small venue, decor a bit dated. Bathroom needs to be cleaned more often. 

Overall I would say 4 for friendliness, prompt, and location.

The Key Lime cupcake was the best of the lot. I'm a sucker for key lime, but that's this cupcake's saving grace. The flavor was very subtle, and this is a trend with all the cupcakes. 

The Lemon cupcake was very much lacking in flavor. Even more subtle than the Key Lime. 

One good thing are the cakes themselves; at least they're moist. And the ratio of frosting to cake is spot on. However the flavors are not quite what I was expected, especially given how much each cupcake cost. 

I'll probably try this place again sometime next year, if they're still in business. Maybe there will be a tastier batch of cupcakes! As for now I'm going to pass.

49524,2,1548115200000,"Cosmo is great! The park consists of four areas - the main area with water, two large dog fenced areas, and one small dog area. 

The water area makes me nervous because it's not difficult for my dog to walk along the edge, under the fence, and out into the insecure area leading to the parking lot. He's done it enough that we don't go to that side anymore. 

Anyway, we still love coming here and going to just the grass fenced in areas. There's usually a good amount of dogs here to socialize with. Each of the large dog areas have a different ""agility"" type structure. One is a triangle wall and the other is a zig zag raised platform.

Our particular room had two full beds, a large bathroom, an ironing board with iron, a vanity, a desk, tv and air conditioning. 

I love the fact that the rooms are cozy. Not too fancy, but just what you need in order to have a quiet nights sleep. 

If you're alright with driving to the strip, this is the place for you. Otherwise, if you're pretty high maintenance and need a room with microwave, room service and a fridge, this isn't your place.

Most La Quinta's offer a free Continental Breakfast, which is usually more than just you bagel with cream cheese but also includes hot eggs, bacon, etc.

First meal was a wonderful Carne Adobada with black beans and rice.  Meat was tender and juicy, sauce was GLUTEN-FREE and super tasty.  I thoroughly enjoyed this meal, however, the $16 price tag was a little steep.

My second meal was Carnitas and they sucked.  The pork was tough and lacked any real flavor and came topped with literally a teaspoon of pico de gallo leaving the plate 90% plain pork and 100% boring.

I do like the fact they have their gluten-free options highlighted on their online menu, and can provide that same menu in-store, on-demand.

My friend suggested I take it over to Bobby's. Called there. He took me right away.

He didn't charge me a thing.
That is not all. Last week I was rushing to my doc appt, went to turn the key and my car was dead as a door nail. I couldn't believe it as I just had a new battery installed before I left CA.

Went to Lupo as our final dinner in Vegas. It was the worst experience out of the 5 nights there. 

1) asked to sit somewhere warm immediately before we were sat. However they put us right next to the door. And we froze. It took forever to get a drink menu or a sever to inquiry about us. And I had to ask twice to move until they did something about it 
2) all the reviews mentioned decent gluten free options. So I got the pizza and it was horrible. Like the worse gluten free pizza ever. Worse than Dominos or Seasons pizza. It was burnt. No flavor in the dough. 

Honest i wouldn't recommend this for anyone that has celiacs or intolerance.",2
44254,1,1546732800000,"the ambience is alright but that's really about it.

the meal started off with bread. nothing special about it. decent bread + butter. next.

the steak..... the steak was underwhelming to say the least. the price really sets you up for disappointment. for a steak worth 50+ dollars, you end up expecting nothing but excellence. what you actually get is a decent cut of meat with a slightly bland flavor. i am no expert but i am sure that steak can taste better than this.

there are no sides included to the steak so we ended up ordering a side of mac and cheese. again, pretty bland. we also had another side that i have a difficult time remembering - which indicates that it's not worth the mention anyway.

overall, the food wasn't exactly terrible. but if you're going to spend over 50 dollars for a meal, i'd recommend that you spend it somewhere else.

two stars for edible food, ordinary service, with an ok ambience.",1

38634,2,1548892800000,"This is the shopping center of today and also the future.

Pedestrian-friendly, open air, with a good mix of restaurants and high end retailers.

This, combined with Kierland Commons across the street, is a great place to spend a few hours during the day or at night.

I especially like True Food Kitchen...a destination type restaurant with great food and drinks.

I always stop by the Quarter when I'm in Scottsdale.  It has replaced Fashion Square as my go to shopping and entertainment place while in town.",2
40625,2,1548720000000,"Sadly, we thought we got nickeled & dimed.  Upcharge of $1.99 for skim milk for coffee was disappointing.  We were given heavy whipping cream for coffee. Bizarre since half & half is what most people use. Eggs were runny & potatoes tasted like vegetable oil.  Saving grace... pancakes were good.  No extra napkins on the table.  When we requested them we didn't get them.  Staff seemed in a hurry to clear our table.  & the bill was given to us as soon as we started eating.",2
30817,1,1546300800000,"Found this boutique while browsing through a local magazine.  Its fairly new at Town Square and a short walk from Whole Foods.
I was warmly greeted and helped by the staff, but they didn't hover.
Items were very nicely priced...too nice to not buy.  
Great items- classy and trendy.  Def on par for girls like me in their 20s.
PS. They sent me a coupon/thank you note after visiting, HANDWRITTEN!",2
43475,2,1547251200000,New to the Cleveland area so thought we'd scope out some new places. Built up an appetite after the gym and decided to give Pacific East a try. The place felt a little stuffy due to the cooking oil and poor ventilation. We got the sushi bridge for two (definitely enough to feed at three). Biggest salmon fan but favorite dish there was the seared ahi and unagi (eel) nigiri...might just get the unagi donburi next time with some of the char kway teow (Malaysian chow fun??) that looked amazing.,3
49977,1,1547337600000,"A five star rating for their drycleaning quality and 4 stars for their prices.  Not the cheapest, but relatively cheap nonetheless.  Fast turnaround.

Definitely my go to place now.

We'll see if this continues.",2
